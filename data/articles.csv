2019-09-01 22:38:29,"Workers who have a stash of employer stock in their 401(k)s can make use of a tax-saving move known as net unrealized appreciation, or NUA. But this tax-saving move is also available to heirs who inherit 401(k)s that hold employer stock, IRA expert Ed Slott recently noted at his IRA workshop in National Harbor, Md.

Here's how the NUA strategy works: Say a deceased worker had employer stock in his 401(k) with an original cost basis of $100,000 and a current value of $500,000. If the heir rolls assets from the 401(k) to an inherited IRA, she can split off the appreciated employer stock and roll that into a taxable brokerage account.

The heir will owe ordinary income tax on the original cost basis. When she later sells the appreciated stock from the taxable account, the NUA--the difference between the cost basis and the current market value of the employer stock--will be taxed at long-term capital-gains tax rates. Note that the heir doesn't get a step-up in basis on the appreciated employer stock.

If instead she rolls the appreciated employer stock into the inherited IRA along with the rest of the 401(k) assets, she'll owe ordinary income tax on all the withdrawals, including the employer stock. And that would be a costly move tax-wise.

Her total tax bill at today's top rates using the NUA strategy would be $117,000--$37,000 on the original cost basis at a 37% top ordinary income rate and $80,000 on the $400,000 of NUA at the top capital-gains rate of 20%. If she doesn't use the NUA strategy, at a 37% top ordinary rate, she'd owe tax of $185,000--or $68,000 more.

Meantime, a written US defense published on Friday in the first of the three legal cases read , ""China has taken the unilateral decision to adopt aggressive industrial policy measures to steal or otherwise unfairly acquire the technology of its trading partners; the United States has adopted tariff measures to try to obtain the elimination of China's unfair and distortive technology-transfer policies,""

SAO PAULO, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Burger King will launch a plant-based burger imitating meat called the ""Rebel Whopper"" in Brazil in November, the company said on Tuesday, amid an international rush for mass-market chains to cater to vegetarian and vegan diners.

Burger King will sell the vegetarian burgers developed by meatpacker Marfrig Global Foods SA  for 29.90 reais ($7.26) in Brazil, representatives of the two companies said at a press briefing in Sao Paulo.

The launch of plant-based products comes amid heightened consumer concerns over health, the environment and even animal welfare, forcing companies to adapt to consumers wanting to eat less meat.

The trend has given rise to non-meat start-ups like Beyond Meat Inc  and Impossible Foods Inc in the United States, with Brazil-based traditional meat-packers like Marfrig and JBS SA  following suit.

Burger King, owned by Brazilian-controlled 3G Capital via its majority stake in Restaurant Brands International , will launch the burger in Sao Paulo city on Sept. 10, expanding to Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states in October, and elsewhere in November.

The chain found in a survey that 69% of Brazilian consumers were likely to buy a plant-based burger if offered at Burger King, ranking first ahead of China with 41%, the company's Brazil CEO Iuri Miranda said.

He estimated Brazil's fast food market is worth 400 billion reais ($97 billion).

In the United States, Impossible Foods supplies the plant-based burgers sold in Burger King stores, while Marfrig will be the chain's exclusive supplier in Brazil.

Executives at Burger King and Marfrig declined to comment on details or duration of that contract.

Marfrig's chief executive for South America, Miguel Gularte, said the company is developing other plant-based products which may be sold in supermarkets, but they will not use the same recipes as the Burger King burgers.

Sept 3 (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers union on Tuesday said that it would target General Motors Co first of the Detroit automakers for talks ahead of the current four-year contract's expiration on Sept. 14.

This year's contract talks between the union and GM, Ford Motor Co  and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV ,  are expected to be contentious as U.S. new vehicle sales are slowing and automakers face rising costs associated with the development of electric vehicles and self-driving cars. 

GM in particular has been a target of union ire since announcing the closure of five North American plants late last year. 

That move drew a wave of criticism, including from U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump has repeatedly prodded GM and last week said the No. 1 U.S. automaker should begin moving its operations in China back to the United States. 

""We are prepared and we are all ready to stand up for our members, our communities and our manufacturing future,"" UAW President Gary Jones said in a statement.

In a statement, GM said, ""We look forward to having constructive discussions with the UAW on reaching an agreement that builds a strong future for our employees and our business."" 

The contracts come at a difficult time for the UAW, as a federal corruption investigation into the union continues to grow.

Last week, the FBI conducted searches at Jones' home, a union retreat and multiple other locations, including the home of the union's previous president, Dennis Williams. 

To date, seven people linked to the union and the automaker have been sentenced in the government's corruption investigation.

Second quarter GDP data has been revised downward, showing that the US expanded at only 2.0% in the quarter instead of the first-reported 2.1%. Government spending, weaker exports, and private inventories weighed on the numbers. However, the very good news in the data is that consumer spending increase was the strongest in 4.5 years.

FINSUM : Consumer spending is at its highest levels since 2014 at the same time as bond yields are at extraordinary lows and everyone is worried about a recession. Either a recession will arrive or there will be some big losses in bond markets.

Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the iShares Russell 3000 ETF ( IWV  ) back on 5/31/2000 - you would have paid $78.27 per share. Fast forward to 5/31/2012 and each share was worth $77.79 on that date, a loss of $0.48 or 0.6% decrease over twelve years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $10.77 per share in dividends over the same period, increasing your return to 13.15%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.0%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 7% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Taubman Centers Inc (Symbol: TCO) is a member of the Russell 3000, giving it special status as one of the largest 3000 companies on the U.S. stock markets.

2019-09-03 12:05:01,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

To be sure, the acquisition by Nvidia  (NASDAQ: NVDA ) of Mellanox Technologies (NASDAQ: MLNX ) isn't a transformative deal for Nvidia stock. The current price of NVDA - $167 - suggests a market capitalization just over $100 billion. Nvidia has agreed to pay just under $7 billion for Mellanox.

That said, the acquisition might be more important than the numbers suggest. And it's possible uncertainty surrounding its approval is part of the reason why NVDA stock continues to trade sideways.

After all, the Mellanox deal touches on key aspects of the case for - and against - Nvidia stock at the moment. Meanwhile, with MLNX stock near a post-acquisition low, the market clearly is pricing in a shrinking chance of approval.

The question for Mellanox stock is whether the potential upside is worth the risk of the deal breaking. The question for Nvidia stock is whether a broken deal at this point would raise more concern - or could potentially be even good news.

Back in March, Nvidia won a bidding war for Mellanox. Reports leading up to the announcement suggested that Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) and Xilinx (NASDAQ: XLNX ) all were interested in the Israeli networking provider.

It was Nvidia that was willing to pay the highest price - and perhaps with good reason. The addition of Mellanox's interconnect portfolio (adapters and switches) gives Nvidia an edge in its datacenter business. The acquisition, as CEO Jensen Huang put it, allowed Nvidia to ""double down"" in that key end market.

At the time that the acquisition was announced, approval seemed assured. The ""deal spread"" - the return on MLNX stock assuming the deal closed at the $125 per share acquisition price - initially was just 6%. That narrowed at one point to as little as 3.4% .

It's now near 17%, however - almost at its widest point ever. Trade war concerns are the primary factor . China blocked the acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ: NXPI ) by Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) last year. It may see the Nvidia-Mellanox deal as another way to score trade war points .

MLNX traded around $90 at the beginning of this year before falling amid chip sector concerns and then rising amid takeover speculation. The current price of $107 thus probably suggests the market sees a roughly 50-60% chance of approval at this point, assuming the stock would head back to the $90 level if Nvidia walked away. Again, the interesting question is what that means for NVDA stock at the moment.

The simplest thesis is that NVDA stock takes a hit if the Mellanox deal falls through. For one, Nvidia, according to its 10-Q , would owe Mellanox a $350 million termination fee.

But that fee is relatively insignificant: about 0.34% of the current Nvidia market capitalization. It's the impact to the NVDA ""story"" that looks much more important.

After all, the two big risks to Nvidia stock right now seem to be in datacenter and in sector/macro sentiment. Datacenter demand has slowed notably across the industry so far this year. Nvidia management continues to see a second-half rebound , but clearly investors aren't convinced.

Meanwhile, the U.S.-China trade battle has been a negative for chip stocks across the board. Stocks in the sector, including NVDA, INTC and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ), have been repeatedly rattled by tariff concerns. And the macro concerns amplify the category-specific worries in datacenter: a global recession likely means Nvidia over promises in the second half of FY20, just as it did a year ago with the "" crypto bubble "".

On top of those two risks, a broken deal means management worries start getting a little louder. Nvidia whiffed on crypto last year. It could whiff on datacenter this year. Management insisted on the Q2 conference call last month that the deal would close by the end of the year. If it's wrong again, three big forecasting misses in roughly a year will erode the credibility of Huang and CFO Colette Kress.

At the very least, just getting the deal done takes one worry - even if it's a relatively minor issue - off the proverbial table. This is a stock where, as I wrote in July, no news probably is good news . Less news probably is as well.

That said, a broken deal certainly isn't fatal to Nvidia stock. The company certainly paid up for Mellanox: Huang called the purchase price "" beyond imagination "".

Meanwhile, as Will Ashworth noted last week, Nvidia has paused its share repurchases until closing. Those investors most bullish on NVDA stock might well prefer the company spend $7 billion (it has a $7.2 billion authorization at the moment) on Nvidia shares, not those of Mellanox.

With a previously announced plan for $3 billion in total returns by the end of FY20 (i.e., this January), Nvidia likely would ramp its buybacks rather quickly if and when Chinese regulators blocked the acquisition. And so a broken deal could lead to a short-term dip, followed by a mid-term gain as buy-the-dip investors and Nvidia itself step in.

Again, the Mellanox deal on its own isn't going to make or break NVDA stock. But it matters. It matters to the story. It matters to the fundamentals, as Nvidia projected the deal to be accretive to earnings-per-share and free cash flow.

And it might be at this point, given the volatility in Nvidia stock, that a resolution of any kind can help. This, after all, is a stock that less than a year ago was nearing $300, and a seemingly bulletproof growth story.

Since then, there has been so much noise. The crypto hangover arrived. Trade war speculation has continued ad nauseam. Datacenter has slowed. And NVDA as a result has been bouncing around for almost ten months now.

For the stock to rally, any kind of certainty would help. And so it's possible that news on Mellanox - whether positive or negative - on its own could be a boost to Nvidia stock.

As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-03 16:13:00," Boeing BA  shares fell roughly 3% in intraday trading today after news broke that the company may not return its 737 MAX in time for the busy holiday season. Friction between Boeing and international air safety authorities threaten a new delay of the return of their 737 MAX fleet. Regulators from the US, Europe, Brazil, and elsewhere complained that Boeing failed to provide technical details and answers to specifics about modifications in the operation of MAX flight-control computers. As a result, Boeing is now forced to resubmit briefing documents describing proposed software changes.  Airlines Push Back 737 Return Dates   Major airlines have been pushing back the dates they expect to reincorporate the Boeing 737 into their fleets. Southwest Airlines LUV  reported in late July that it would not be flying the Boeing 737 until next year. United UAL  and American AAL  Airlines have both canceled 737 flights until December. Forcing Boeing to resubmit its briefing documents sets the company back by several weeks and diminishes any chance it had of returning by the end of the year holidays. Industry officials in Europe do not believe they will be seeing the Boeing plane return to service until January at the earliest. European regulators will likely need more time to examine the changes made to the 737 MAX's flight control computers and its MCAS. Misfires from the MCAS were the causes of two fatal crashes and resulted in the grounding of the airplane in mid-March. A Federal Aviation Administration spokesman said that the agency continues to follow a thorough process, not a prescribed timeline. Airlines do not want to run the risk of counting on the plane for it to end up being hit with an additional delay. People flying during the busy holiday season don't have much flexibility or patience for last minute changes. Southwest commented, ""By proactively removing the MAX from scheduled service, we can reduce last-minute flight cancellations and unexpected disruptions to our customers' travel plans.""  Takeaway  Boeing is hoping to have the 737 MAX back in the air early in their fourth quarter, but the continued friction between the company and international air safety regulators have made it difficult. Boeing has submitted, or been on the verge of submitting, three earlier versions of software fixes only to be delayed by various technical issues. Airlines are beginning to move on from the Boeing aircraft as their busy holiday traveling season is just around the corner. Continued difficulties with getting the FAA's approval to have the plane back in the sky poses the risk of major airliners making plans without the aircraft in 2020.

2019-09-03 10:57:11,"Investors in Encana Corp (Symbol: ECA) saw new options begin trading today, for the October 11th expiration. At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ECA options chain for the new October 11th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.

Because the $4.00 strike represents an approximate 7% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 71%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.75% return on the cash commitment, or 36.02% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost .

Considering the fact that the $5.00 strike represents an approximate 16% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 81%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.16% boost of extra return to the investor, or 11.14% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost .

2019-09-03 14:52:38,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

When the U.S. Federal Reserve ended its interest rate hiking cycle and started lowering rates instead, financial stocks drifted lower. With lower rates, banks earn fewer profits from the interest rate spread. Plus, rate cuts are usually done to stimulate a slowing economy. If banks rely on a healthy economy to get deals and drive more business, then we may expect profits to slow down.

But there are several financial stocks to buy now that have the potential to bounce back higher as profit growth steadies.

A few of these stocks to buy happen to be Canadian banks, which means there are a few important things to consider when investing in these stocks:

With that out of the way, the here are the best financial stocks to own based on valuation, future growth prospects and dividend yield .

Toronto-Dominion Bank (NYSE: TD ) reported third-quarter earnings on Aug. 29. It earned C$1.79 a share (non-GAAP) and GAAP earnings-per-share of C$1.74; meanwhinel, revenue rose 6.1% year-over-year to C$10.5 billion.

TD has a healthy balance of exposure in Canadian and U.S. retail. Canadian Retail adjusted net income rose 3% from last year to C$1.92 billion. It benefited from both higher volumes and higher margins. Revenue from its wealth and insurance business also increased. Its U.S. Retail Bank adjusted net income grew 11% year-over-year to C$1.29 billion. TD Ameritrade performed very well as revenue grew 21% YoY.

TD reported positive results in each of its segments because it continued to elevate the customer experience. It introduced solutions such as an international remittance tool. This lets its customers send money through Easy Web for a cash payout at over 500,000 Western Union (NYSE: WU ) locations worldwide. Its discount brokerage benefited from a refreshed Learning Center. In its U.S. Retail bank unit, revenue grew due to strong loan and deposit growth, along with higher fee income.

TD's net interest margin was 3.27%, down sequentially on lower deposit margins and balance sheet mix. It also posted a 12% sequential increase in credit card losses ($191 million). These numbers are not enough to alarm investors. Its Tier 1 ratio is 12%, consistent with the prior quarter. Overall, TD benefited from strong credit quality across its portfolios and expects continued growth ahead.

TD shares have a dividend yielding 4.16% and a price-to-earnings ratio of 11.6X.

Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE: RY ) reported non-GAAP EPS of C$2.26 and GAAP EPS of C$2.22. Net income grew 8% to C$1.609 billion. Revenue rose 4.6% YoY to C$11.54 billion.

The company reported higher earnings in Personal and Commercial Banking and Wealth Management and Insurance. It benefited from higher average fee-based client assets, driven by market appreciation and net sales. Net interest income grew thanks to average volume growth. This was offset by lower earnings in Capital Markets and Investor and Treasury Services. Royal recorded an 8 bps increase in provisions for credit losses (PCL), due to higher provisions in Capital Markets. But its CET1 ratio is a healthy 11.9% and the company raised its dividend by 3% to $1.05 a share. Royal also faced higher costs in support of business growth and higher variable compensation.

To further increase shareholder returns, Royal Bank announced that it bought back C$197 million in the quarter and 5.7 million shares year-to-date.

Looking ahead, the bank's strong underlying credit quality from its Canadian residential portfolio should continue to lift results. Interests are likely to fall next month in the country, stimulating mortgage demand. In Q3, its total mortgage portfolio was C$256 billion.

Royal Bank trades at a P/E of 11.39 times earnings, while the stock offers a dividend yielding 4.21%.

Bank of Montreal (NYSE: BMO ) fell hard in August ahead of its earnings report but finally found support at around $67. Even after a slight bounce, closing at $68.60, BMO stock trades at 9.7 times earnings. Its dividend yield is 4.55%. BMO reported non-GAAP EPS of C$2.36 and revenue growth of 4.5%, to C$5.78 billion. Despite reporting a higher provision for credit losses in the quarter, the market bid the stock higher after the quarterly report.

Despite reporting higher provisions, its CEO expressed confidence for its overall credit quality in its portfolio. The higher provision is due to a few factors. First, higher Canadian consumer losses realized are due almost entirely to the implementation issues with a new consumer collections platform. Second, it took a single large loss from its Canadian commercial portfolio. And third, its performing loans (PCL) increased due to a modestly softer economic outlook.

To improve its performance for the rest of the year, Bank of Montreal will look for efficiencies. As it works to lower its efficiency ratio down and delivering it through operating leverage, it aims to reach an efficiency target of 58% by 2021.

In the fourth quarter, the bank is on track to deliver positive operating leverage. Expense growth will slow by half the rate of the first half of the year.

JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM ) reported quarterly results on July 16, which sent JPM stock to a YTD high of around $116. But the stock fell slightly and closed recently at $109.22. Shares are valued at 11.12 times earnings and have a dividend yield of 3.3%.

On Aug. 14, when the yield curve first inverted (the 10-year Treasury yield fell below the two-year Treasury rate), bank stocks sold off. Yet economic expectations are still strong and should limit any drop in JPM stock.

In Q2 19, JPMorgan reported net income of $9.7 billion and EPS of $2.82. While total loans rose 2%, home lending average loans fell 7% YoY. Average deposits rose 4% YoY. The bank ended the quarter with a Standardized CET1 ratio of 12.2%. In the quarter, JPMorgan delivered strong capital returns by distributing $7.5 billion to shareholders. This includes a $5 billion stock buyback.

JPMorgan's Consumer and Community Banking delivered $4.2 billion in net income, up 22% from last year. Higher net interest income and higher auto lease volumes drove these strong results. The strong credit performance across businesses and another quarter of positive operating leverage should continue for the rest of the year. The credit business benefits from credit costs of $1.1 billion, down 5% YoY. Charge-off rates of 8 basis points were favorable in the quarter and will continue to be so. Strong card loan growth and a good mortgage business suggest steady performance for the next few quarters.

Banco Santander (NYSE: SAN ) looked as though it would hold the $4.60 - $5 range earlier this year. That range broke down when the stock fell last month and in August. SAN stock closed at $3.78 and has a P/E of 7.89X. Its dividend yield is 6.88%.

In the second quarter, Santander reported strong sequential volume growth in loans (up 2%) and consumer funds (up 3%). Profits grew by 8%. Its loyal and digital customer base grew at an impressive double-digit growth. In Q2, profits of EUR 1.391 billion was affected by a EUR 706 million charge, mostly due to restructuring costs. For H1/2019, its underlying profit topped EUR 4,045 billion ($4.469 billion).

Santander has a healthy profitability and solvency profile. CET1 was 11.3%, down 49 bps YTD due to regulatory effects and restructuring costs. With an enormous customer base and steady growth over the last year, Santander is one of the worst-performing financial stocks. Management is aware of the difficulty with growing revenue in mature markets. More competitors are coming to the market, so price reductions hurt profit growth. Still, it continues to increase its strategy of earning customer loyalty. And as it cuts costs by at least EUR 1 billion in Europe, profitability will grow.

Banco Santander has a healthy balance sheet and continues to build its capital ratio. With lower costs and profit growth ahead, Santander stock should eventually find a bottom.

Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ) showed a ""double top"" at $31 between May and the end of July on the charts. And for the rest of August, the stock slumped, bottoming in the $26 range and closing recently at $27.33. The stock has a P/E of 9.73X and a dividend yield of 2.63%. This U.S. bank is relatively cheaper compared to its peers.

BAC reported earnings on July 17: GAAP EPS of 74 cents and revenue of $23.1 billion. Revenue grew 2%, but it is the return metrics that should impress investors. Return on average assets rose to 1.23%, up from 1.17% last year. The return on average common shareholders' equity topped 11.6%, up from 10.8%. Bank of America grew loans and leases by 4%. Average deposits increased $75 billion, up 6% YoY. Since Q2 18, client flows increased by $24 billion.

BAC reported a CET1 of $171 billion and a CET1 ratio of 11.7%. To signal confidence in its business growth ahead, it raised its dividend by 20%. And when the book value per share rose 10% to $26.41, investors are clearly paying a very small premium for the business.

The market is overlooking the consistent performance of this bank. It delivered positive operating leverage for 18 consecutive quarters. So, growing consumer banking digital usage, increasing average deposits and higher loans and leases will lead to continued profit growth.

Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC ) is still in the dog house, years after it signed customers up for unwanted auto insurance and opening of accounts in customers' names. The stock is stuck in the $45 - $50 range, closing at $46.19 recently. At a P/E of 9.8X and with a dividend yielding 4.49%, investors may wait for the company to continue repairing its reputation. As it wins back customers, growth will come.

Wells Fargo reported Q2 2019 net income of $6.2 billion and diluted EPS of $1.30. Its return of average tangible common equity (ROTCE) was 15.78%. Customer sentiment improved when a branch survey indicated the highest level of customer loyalty and ""overall satisfaction with the most recent visit"" in over three years. Loans and deposits grew from last year, debit and credit cards rose and credit card usage increased. The company returned $6.1 billion to shareholders through stock buybacks and stock dividends. And with its dividend at 45 cents a share, this is up 15% from last year.

Wells Fargo expects that despite the Fed funds rate falling, consumer deposits will increase. Since deposits are very inexpensive to operate, it expects healthy benefits from higher deposits. It also has a promotional activity plan ready to attract deposits. Costs are always something the bank may work on lowering. As it prioritizes expense control without compromising risk controls, performance should improve.

As of this writing, Chris Lau owned shares of Banco Santander.

2019-09-02 08:02:46,"Both mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are designed to give investors great diversification. For example, instead of just investing in a few technology stocks, buying a technology stock mutual fund or ETF would allow you to own dozens or more than 100 technology stocks at the same time so you don't have all of your eggs in just a few technology stocks.

Diversification is one of the best rules an investor can use to protect principal. The downturn of one company's stock doesn't affect your returns nearly as much if you have a diversified mutual fund or ETF.

There is no shortage of arguments in the active-vs.-passive investment management debate, with brilliant minds arguing each side.

Morningstar found that active U.S. stock funds succeeded nearly twice as often in down 36-month periods than up periods. The ability of fund managers to make proactive changes during volatile and down-trending times works well historically. In the 11th year of this bull market, downside protection makes a lot of sense for our retired clients.

Regardless of the reasons, many investment professionals choose to believe in either active or passive investing strategies, but few seem to believe in both. However, when you dig into the characteristics of each, there are pros and cons worth exploring, which is why we use a combination of the two approaches for our clients.

For the individual investor, one of the best ways to compare active and passive strategies is through mutual funds (often actively managed) and ETFs (often passive). By default, usually mutual funds are actively managed by a team of professional portfolios managers who decide which stocks to buy and sell within the fund. Those managers have to be compensated for managing the money, so mutual funds typically carry higher internal costs.

Alternatively, ETFs often have very low expenses because they are usually passive. There really isn't a portfolio manager or investment professional behind the scenes making daily investment decisions as there is with mutual funds .

Buying a mutual fund is like hiring someone to manage your money for you and buy and sell stocks within the fund on your behalf. Performance will largely be dependent on the fund manager's investment criteria and stock-picking acumen. Buying an ETF is like buying the entire S&P 500 index or another ""basket"" of stocks that rarely changes. Performance will be tied to the overall index itself and will not deviate, because the ETF is set up to own the exact stocks of the index it tracks and in the exact same quantities. ETFs can be tied to an index, a specific asset or basket of assets such as bonds, currencies, real estate, etc. The point is ETFs give you diversification within that index or asset type.

While fees and ""behind-the-scenes"" investment activity are two key differences, each strategy comes with positive and negative attributes.

In addition to having higher costs, mutual funds are often considered less tax-efficient than ETFs. Every time a mutual fund manager sells a stock within the fund at a gain, that gain is passed on to the investor, who in turn owes taxes on it. Comparatively , ETF investors typically only pay taxes on the gain between the price they paid for the ETF and the price they sold it for.

While lower costs are a primary advantage, ETFs may not have the flexibility to take advantage of short-term stock price movements the way a mutual fund manager does. ETF holdings will remain the same regardless of short-term conditions, whereas a mutual fund manager can quickly sell one stock and replace it with a different one for strategic reasons. Or a mutual fund manager can have less stock exposure if they feel they should due to overall market conditions.

Another primary difference is ETFs are bought and sold like a stock throughout the day, and mutual fund shares are purchased or sold only at the end of the trading day. While neither good nor bad in the grand scheme of things, the ability to buy and sell entire baskets of stocks throughout the day using ETFs can be appealing.

Investing in mutual funds offers the chance at outperforming the stock market, especially during downturns, while most ETFs typically do not as they simply follow the index returns. At the same time, mutual funds can underperform the market, and generally ETFs will always perform the same as the index or ""market"" they are designed to track, less a small fee.

Traditional mutual funds can carry higher expenses, as Investopedia research states that the average large cap mutual fund expense ratio is 1.25% per year. The mutual funds I prefer to use, when available, are institutional class , which have a minimum investment of $200,000 per fund and typically the lowest mutual fund fees. Our firm's strategic relationships with various investment providers and platforms often allow us to provide minimum thresholds significantly lower than the standard.

ETFs are low cost and can be traded throughout the day. Mutual funds may come with higher fees (though much lower when using institutional class shares) but offer the ability to make strategic moves within the portfolio as well as the opportunity to outperform benchmarks during challenging times.

The bottom line is ETFs and institutional mutual funds are both useful tools. Active stock mutual funds historically outperform ETFs in down markets, and in the 11th year of this bull market, we prefer to use a combination of the two strategies. We find this is an effective way to get our clients what they want: true diversification, generally very low internal fees and the ability to get returns with a level of risk the client is comfortable with.

As a fiduciary, I have to act in the best interest of my clients, which means putting them in portfolios with the amount of risk that is appropriate and that they want to take. Since most of my clients are millionaire retirees who have a higher amount of wealth, protection of their principal is often their utmost concern at this time.

The bond market is doing something that it usually doesn't-it is scaring stocks. Generally speaking, big sell offs in stocks drive moves in bonds, but rarely do moves in bonds spook stocks. Except for right now, that is. The ten-year yield dropped to 1.48% recently, below the two-year's 1.51%, signaling another 2y-10y inversion which is a classic recession indicator. But the 3m-10y is even scarier as it touched a fresh new low of negative 51 basis points.

FINSUM : The bond market thinks a recession is coming and that Fed policy is too tight. The velocity with which that sentiment is driving yields is spooking stocks, and rightly so.

The last month has been an unusually tough market. While the volatility itself is not highly irregular, what has been difficult is the rise of correlation. Over the last month, the market has traded the same way a whopping seven times. On those days, stocks, bond yields, and commodities have all traded in the same direction. When that happens it is very hard for investors to find a place to hide.

FINSUM : A couple of months ago using bonds as a safe haven seemed like a good idea. But prices have gone up so astronomically without a real change in the economy, that fixed income is looking like a fragile place to hide.

But do     these analysts even know what they're talking about? Today,     we're taking one high-profile Wall Street pick and putting it     under the microscope...  Steel stocks got walloped last month. Shares of steel minimill operator   Nucor    (NYSE: NUE) fell 13% from the end of July to the end of August,   while   U.S. Steel    (NYSE: X) plummeted 30%, culminating in price target cuts on both   companies at the end of the month, when investment banker   Citigroup lowered its targets for Nucor and U.S. Steel to $55 and   $12, respectively.makeArticleAd(); The reason? In part, it's the ongoing   trade war    between the U.S. and China, which has weighed on the global   economy and caused steel consumers to cut back on their orders.   In part, it's...   still    the trade war, which heated up even more last month after China   restarted a threatened 25% tariff on imports of American cars and   trucks, promising to hurt automobile production in the U.S., as   well as demand for steel to produce such vehicles.   Image source: Getty Images.  But hope springs eternal for steel investors, and this   morning, the industry is getting a bit of a lift from a note out   at Credit Suisse. In a positive initiation jus   t report    ed by   SteetInsider.com    , we learn that the Swiss megabanker thinks steel prices are due   for a turnaround -- perhaps as early as Q1 of next year.   Surveying the industry, the analyst picks European steelmaker   ArcelorMittal    (NYSE: MT) as perhaps the first steel specialist to benefit from   an improving global economy. Here's what you need to know. Reversing course on steel sentiment Just four months ago, Credit Suisse   was feeling bearish    , warning that the Trump administration's cease-fire on steel   tariffs against Canada and Mexico would admit a wave of cheap   steel into the U.S., depressing prices for U.S. steelmakers. The   threat of cheap Canadian steel from Stelco in particular prompted   the analyst to downgrade American companies   Steel Dynamics    (NASDAQ: STLD) and   AK Steel    (NYSE: AKS) . Today, however, Credit Suisse is looking to foreign shores for   a revival in steel demand, initiating coverage of European steel   giant ArcelorMittal with an outperform rating and a $29 price   target. Steel prices continued rising for about a month after Credit   Suisse's downgrades, you see, topping out around $920 a ton for   U.S. Midwest domestic hot-rolled coil, for example. But they then   fell as low as $525 a ton by early July. That month, however,   global steelmakers began slowing production of their product, and   partly as a result of that, steel prices inched back upwards in   August, reaching $584 per ton. Credit Suisse expects this trend of reviving steel prices to   continue, and predicts a clear turnaround in the steel market   within the next six months, which would imply better prices   toward the end of Q1 2020. Who will benefit? Credit Suisse predicts that ArcelorMittal could be a   top stock to buy    on strong steel prices, and ""a major cash generator following two   years of investing in growth,"" as StreetInsider reports. And   indeed, the company is already showing some strength in this   regard. True, profitability as calculated according to generally   accepted accounting principles (   GAAP    ) is down lately, but over the past 12 months, free cash flow at   ArcelorMittal has jumped to $1.8 billion, trending up sharply   from the $891 million in positive cash profits produced last   year. And ArcelorMittal isn't the only one. Nucor's free cash flow is also climbing, hitting $1.4 billion   over the past 12 months, according to      S&P Global Market Intelligence    data, despite a slide in GAAP profitability. And at Nucor's   archrival, Steel Dynamics -- one of the companies Credit Suisse   downgraded in May -- free cash flow of $1.2 billion is at least   holding steady for the time being. Not all steel companies are doing as well. At AK Steel, for   example (the other company Credit Suisse downgraded last spring),   cash generation is slipping and capital spending is rising,   resulting in a one-third decline in trailing free cash flow   versus 2018 levels. U.S. Steel, where free cash flow turned   negative last year, is seeing the cash drain worsen in 2019 --   even as the company reports $1 billion in GAAP profits,   indicating poor quality o   f earnings    . But as a general rule, what's good for one steelmaker (i.e.,   greater steel demand and higher steel prices) should tend to   benefit even these weaker players. Caveats and provisos One concern that doesn't get much mention in Credit Suisse's   note, I think, that   does    deserve highlighting, is debt. Too-high debt loads can weigh on   any stock, even in a bull market for steel, and would be   especially problematic if Credit Suisse's forecast proves to be   off the mark and steel prices don't rebound as quickly as   predicted. In that regard, I have to say that Nucor and Steel Dynamics,   with debt loads just a small fraction of their market   capitalizations, look much better-positioned to ride a bull   market (or ride out a bear) than their rivals do. Using a common   industry metric, both companies also carry total debt-to-   EBITDA    ratios of less than 1.5, versus 1.8 for ArcelorMittal, 2.1 for   U.S. Steel, and 3.3 for AK Steel. If I were looking to invest in steel stocks on the basis of   Credit Suisse's upgrade today, I'd be considering shares of these   companies in basically that order of attractiveness.   10 stocks we like better than Nucor       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

In what comes as a surprise, the new iteration of the DOL rule may in fact be multiple rules bundled into a package. A lawyer from well-respected industry law firm Drinker Biddle & Reath says they have credible rumors that there will be multiple new rules, and that they will be friendly for those in the industry. The firm says that the new rules will likely be based on the old 1975 five-part test, and that the Best Interest Contract Exemption will be replaced. The new DOL package is also supposed to harmonize well with the SEC's new Best Interest rule, which was approved in June.

FINSUM : It is good news that this rule is supposed to be more friendly to those in the industry, but it is worrying that there may be multiple rules. The more components there are to the rule, the more likely it will be that it is unclear.

But accepting this loan offer may not be   the best choice for your wallet or your credit score. In recent months, two of the largest credit card issuers, Citi   and Chase, have announced they'll offer credit card loans to   eligible cardholders. Citi is offering its Citi Flex Loan, while   Chase plans to launch   My Chase Loan    in late 2019. The new products appear to be aimed at taking a share of the   ballooning market for personal loans, which hit a record $143   billion in the first quarter of 2019, according to credi   t report    ing agency TransUnion, an increase of 19.2% year over year.makeArticleAd(); Credit card loans are fast, convenient and cheaper than cash   advances. But personal finance experts say the loans are still   costly and can lower your credit scores, making it more difficult   to obtain credit with low interest rates in the future. Before you accept this seemingly simple way to get cash,   consider the risks and compare your alternatives. How a credit card loan works Citi and Chase customers don't have to request a loan - or   even apply. The companies are promoting their ""flexible financing   offering"" or new ""loan feature"" via email, direct mail or on   account log-in pages. ""It's very tempting because it's so fast and easy, with no   application,"" says David Rae, a certified financial planner based   in Los Angeles. ""If you're already in debt, it can cause that   debt to snowball and become a big problem."" The amount you can borrow depends on how much credit line you   have available. Once you choose a loan amount and repayment term,   the issuer transfers the cash to your bank account within a   couple of days. Citi will alternatively mail a check. The loans have payback terms of one to five years, and monthly   repayments are added to your card's minimum payment due. Citi and   Chase say they report payments to the credit bureaus as credit   card payments, not as separate loan payments. Having different types of credit on your reports can   positively affect your scores. In this case, ""there's no added   benefit to your credit score, beyond just having a credit card   and making a payment,"" Rae says. You can continue using your credit card, but you'll want to   track your balance and stay under the credit limit to avoid   costly fees. You also won't get cash back, miles or points with   the Citi or Chase loan. The costs and risks Rae advises the loans should only be considered for emergency   expenses if you don't have savings, rather than discretionary   purchases. ""If you're trying to book a vacation or shopping for clothes,   I wouldn't recommend this product,"" he says. Credit card loans may cost less than cash advances, but they   aren't cheap. Citi Flex Loans carry annual percentage rates that range from   7.99% to 8.99%, while My Chase Loan offers vary from 16.99% to   22.24% APR for borrowers with excellent FICO credit scores (over   720). For example, a five-year, $5,000 Citi Flex Loan at 8.99% APR   would have monthly payments of $104 and total interest of   $1,226. Taking the loan also increases your   credit utilization rate    - how much of your credit limit is used. Most financial experts   recommend keeping your total utilization below 30%. This loan can push you above that threshold and lower your   credit score, says Bruce McClary, spokesperson for the National   Foundation for Credit Counseling. Compare alternatives Whenever you borrow, compare interest rates on multiple loan   options and consider features that build your credit or offer   flexible payment schedules.   Personal loans      may offer lower rates, especially if you have excellent credit,     and higher loan amounts. They also show up as separate accounts     on your credit reports, helping to diversify your accounts and     indicate you can handle different types of credit, ultimately     lifting your scores. If you qualify, a     0% APR credit card      is an interest-free loan, as long as you pay the balance before     the introductory offer period ends. Also, you may earn cash     back or travel rewards with this credit card.  ""If you're able to get a credit card with no interest, and you   pay it off within the time frame, you're going to be way better   off financially,"" Rae says.

2019-09-02 16:00:00,"It's never too early to start saving for your child's college costs.

When you have a child, you want to give them every opportunity to succeed in life. Since a degree can open up more employment opportunities and result in a higher salary, going to college is often an important step on the ladder.

But as we all know, college isn't cheap. According to Experian, the average student loan debt was $35,359 in 2018. College costs have also been steadily rising for decades, so if you have a young child or you're currently expecting a baby, it's likely that they'll need to pay much more for school.

By starting a college fund for your child, you can help them get an education without ending up with too much student loan debt. The question many parents ask is: What financial tool should I use to save that money? And fortunately, there are a few excellent options available.

A 529 plan is a state-operated college savings plan, although funds from this type of plan can also be put toward tuition for any school year, from kindergarten to 12th grade. You're allowed to open a 529 plan in any state, whether or not you are a resident. Funds from a 529 plan can also be used for college in any state, as well as for some international universities.

If a 529 plan is used for qualified educational expenses, then withdrawals are tax-free.

There are two types of 529 plans available:

One benefit of 529 plans is that they have high contribution limits. There is no annual limit, and the maximum amount you can add to a 529 plan is determined by the state, with limits ranging from less than $250,000 to more than $500,000.

A 529 plan is a smart choice if:

A Coverdell ESA, also known as an Education Savings Account, is an investment account intended for educational expenses, which can include expenses for college, or kindergarten through 12th grade. Distributions from the plan are tax-free. There is a contribution limit of $2,000 per year per beneficiary.

There are also income restrictions to consider when contributing to an ESA. As of 2019, the amount you can contribute is phased out if you're a single filer with a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) between $95,000 and $110,000 or if you're a couple filing jointly with a MAGI between $190,000 and $220,000.

Since this type of plan is intended for education expenses, if funds are withdrawn for any other reason, there is a 10% penalty and the beneficiary will pay income taxes on the plan's earnings. The beneficiary must also use the funds by the time they turn 30. If they don't, you have two options:

A 529 plan is usually a better choice than an ESA, but there are a couple of situations in which you may want to open an ESA instead:

Although an IRA is obviously intended for your retirement savings , it can also work well as a college fund. There is usually a 10% penalty for withdrawing from an IRA before you reach age 59½, but you can avoid this penalty by using the funds for qualified college expenses.

There are two significant advantages to choosing an IRA over a 529 plan or an ESA:

However, there are also some important disadvantages to this option:

Because of these drawbacks, this option is only recommended if you:

So, which of these college fund options should you go with? For most, a 529 plan will be the way to go, since it offers tax-related advantages and very high contribution limits.

That being said, you could find that an ESA or IRA fits your needs better. Both offer more investment options , and an IRA will allow you added flexibility in how you use your funds.

But whichever one you choose, you'll be making college much more affordable for your child.

It has been a rough road for equities this month. Benchmarks are down 5% and there has been frequent whip-sawing action based on data and news over the trade war. Despite the fears, JP Morgan is telling investors that it is time to buy. The bank's equity strategists, led by Mislav Matejka think that stocks are going to turn the corner very soon. The bank thinks three elements may catalyze a move higher into the year end-restarted ECB easing, a bigger than expected Fed rate cut, and improving technical indicators on signs the market has bottomed out.

FINSUM : The Fed and the ECB could certainly help support stocks, but it hard to imagine benchmarks gaining much if we keep up the frenzy of trade war news.

MILAN, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Industrial vehicle maker CNH Industrial  has decided to split in two and list its truck, bus and engine division in an effort to boost asset values and streamline its businesses.

The plan comes just six years after CNH Industrial was created when Fiat Industrial - spun off from the Italian carmaker - was folded into U.S.-based agricultural and construction machine firm CNH.

Monica Bosio, head of equity research at Intesa Sanpaolo-Banca IMI, said the plan should help boost the value of the agriculture side, which is currently trading at a discount compared to competitors.

""The split should also give more appeal to the truck unit as it might become an interesting asset for other operators, despite the pledge by Exor to remain key shareholder in both entities,"" she said.

CNH's top shareholder Exor - the holding group of Italy's Agnelli family, which also controls Fiat Chrysler Automobiles  and premium sports car maker Ferrari  - said in a statement it supported the new plan.

""Exor will continue to be the shareholder of reference in both entities following completion of the spin-off process,"" it said.

Last year, CNH's agriculture and construction business had proforma sales of $15.6 billion, while its so-called ""On-Highway"" operations generated $13.1 billion.

The group's most profitable businesses were agricultural equipment and powertrains, which both boasted margins of 8.9% compared with the 2.7% of commercial vehicles.

Under the plan, some high-margin industrial vehicle brands including heavy-duty quarry truck maker Astra and Iveco Defence Vehicles will be assigned to the agricultural and construction unit.

""The agricultural entity will trade at higher multiples from the beginning, despite the challenging environment, because that's the business with higher margins. Multiples at the truck entity might increase depending on the management's ability to extract margins and eventual M&A perspectives,"" Bosio added.

But in a sign agricultural margins could also come under pressure, U.S. rival Deere & Co.  last month announced a review of costs after bad weather and the U.S.-China trade war dented profits, triggering a profit warning. 

""It looks as if (Exor head John) Elkann is focusing on cash-in deals to help fund asset diversification at Exor,"" said Roberto Lottici, asset manager at Milan-based Ifigest.

The new plan, dubbed ""Transform 2 Win"" will reduce operating costs and increase efficiency ""through targeted restructuring actions"", CNH said in a statement.

The group expects full implementation of the plan by the end of 2022 and to spend between $450-$500 million in restructuring charges.

In a separate statement, CNH said it planned to enter a strategic and exclusive partnership for Iveco with U.S.-based Nikola Corporation, as it seeks to accelerate its transition towards emission neutrality for heavy-duty trucks in North America and Europe.

The Italian-American group will take a $250 million stake in Nikola, which will kick-off the production of a zero-emission heavy-duty vehicle powered by proprietary hydrogen fuel cell and battery technology, it said.

Massimiliano Chiara, the company's CFO, laid out increases in capex and research and development (R&D) as part of the new plan. Chiara said capex would go up from 1.9% of net sales this year to 3.5% in 2020 and average 3.7% between 2020 and 2024. R&D spending, meanwhile, will go up from 3.8% of net sales to 4.2% in 2020 and average 4.5% from 2020 to 2024.

Milan-listed CNH shares were down 3.5%, having risen as much as 1% when the break-up plan was announced.","CNH Industrial plans breakup, will list its truck and bus unit - Nasdaq.com",https://www.nasdaq.com/article/cnh-industrial-plans-breakup-will-list-its-truck-and-bus-unit-20190903-00325

At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AUY options chain for the new October 11th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.

Because the $3.50 strike represents an approximate 6% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 68%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.29% return on the cash commitment, or 41.17% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost .

Considering the fact that the $4.00 strike represents an approximate 8% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

2019-09-03 08:54:00," Hurricane Dorian continued to batter the coasts of Bahamas on Sep 1 and 2, bringing in heavy rains and wind gusts exceeding 200 miles an hour (per The Wallstreet Journal). It hit the Bahamas as a category 5 hurricane but has now weakened to a category 4 storm per the U.S. National Hurricane Center's (NHC) latest update. The hurricane - deemed as the strongest this year so far in the world - is projected to make landfall in Florida on late Tuesday and then in Georgia, North and South Carolina in the following days.  Impact on Utilities  In times of natural calamities like hurricanes, the Utility  sector tends to suffer. The rampage caused by heavy winds and catastrophic flooding affects transmission lines, forcing thousands to deal with power cuts. Notably, the National Weather Service has warned of hurricane-strength winds, several feet of storm surges and the risk of dangerous flash floods along much of the Florida coastline in the coming days. No doubt, once the catastrophic storm hits the coast of Florida, utilities' operations in the state will suffer, resulting in widespread power outage. Considering the fact that Florida is the third most populated city of the United States, demand and subsequently consumption of electricity is also high. Therefore, some of the top utility players of the United States have significant operations in this state.   Dorian's estimated impact on the state's properties is expected to hamper the smooth flow of electricity through the transmission lines.  Utilities in Focus  We have handpicked a few Utility players that have operations in Dorian's expected pathway and are thus expected to bear the brunt of the storm. In fact, a few of these utilities have announced their emergency infrastructure strengthening initiatives. These utilities carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which makes them worthy of retention in investors' portfolio. You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank   (Strong Buy) stocks here   .  Duke Energy DUK  : This electricity provider expects Dorian to bring tropical force winds that will cause significant damage to its infrastructure and widespread power outages due to flying debris, fallen trees, downed poles and lines. Thus, the company has put nearly 6,500 transmission and distribution personnel in place to support power restoration in Florida, which is nearly three times the typical number of crew in the state.  NextEra Energy NEE  : Its subsidiary, Florida Power & Light Company, expects that a large portion of its service area will be impacted by Dorian and may experience power outages for potentially prolonged periods. Thus, it has arranged for nearly 16,000 personnel to work on restoration and is working to get more resources from across the country before the storm's landfall.  Dominion Energy D  : This Zacks Rank #3 stock has extensive operations in the Carolinas. Per media sources, it has arranged for 40 tree contractors and plans to bring in extra line workers to help with the storm's aftermath.  Southern Company SO  : This company's largest electric subsidiary, Georgia Power, is reportedly monitoring the storm, adjusting plans for response and coordinating with emergency partners, including the Georgia Emergency Management Agency and the National Weather Service. It has already activated its storm command center in Atlanta, GA.  Bottom Line  There's no doubt that utilities in Dorian's expected pathway are doing their best to restore power in the event of an outage and taking necessary infrastructural initiatives to weather storm effects. However, restoring power after a massive storm can be extremely challenging due to strong winds and widespread flooding. Thus, the infrastructural strength of these utilities will be put to test when the hurricane actually hits. Their share price may also take a hit.

2019-09-03 10:47:00,"Sept 3 (Reuters) - Canada'sCrescent Point Energy Corp  said on Tuesday it would exit Uinta Basin in Utah and sell parts of its assets in southeast Saskatchewan for about C$912 million ($687.01 million) as it looks to cut debt under a new management.

The Uinta Basin asset, expected to produce about 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in 2020, was sold to a private operator for about C$700 million in cash, the company said without naming the buyer. 

Investors have been pressing oil and gas explorers to boost cash reserves and invest more in share buybacks instead of aggressive expansion as oil prices remain volatile amid  escalating global trade tensions.

The asset sales will add to its debt-adjusted funds flow per share by about 11%, Crescent said, adding that it will buy back another C$100 million worth of shares by year end.

The oil and gas producer said it would sell more assets, including the remaining portion of its southeast Saskatchewan conventional assets.

""This should all resonate with investors in today's environment, with the potential for additional asset sales bringing the company's leverage position much closer to what investors are looking for in E&P companies today,"" Raymond James analysts wrote in a note.

Shares of the Calgary, Alberta-based company rose 4.1% to C$4.37 per share.

Including Tuesday's sale, the company said it has sold more than C$1.3 billion in assets since the new management took over in 2018.

The company said it now expects 2019 annual average production of between 160,000 boepd to 164,000 boepd, slightly below its earlier forecast of 168,000 boepd to 172,000 boepd.

2019-09-03 09:30:00,"TORONTO, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Canadian manufacturing activity slowed in August as new work received by firms slumped to the lowest level in nearly four years, pressured by trade tensions between the United States and China and global economic uncertainty, data showed on Tuesday.

The IHS Markit Canada Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI), a measure of manufacturing business conditions, fell to a seasonally adjusted 49.1 in August, a three-month low, from 50.2 in July. A reading below 50 shows contraction in the sector.

""Canadian manufacturers reported a setback for business conditions in August, following the slight improvement seen during the previous month,"" said Tim Moore, economics associate director at IHS Markit. ""Concerns about the US-China trade war and rising global economic uncertainty were often cited by survey respondents.""

The Bank of Canada has worried about the risks trade wars pose to the global economy. Economists expect the central bank to leave its benchmark interest rate on hold at 1.75% at Wednesday's policy announcement but see increased likelihood of a cut by year-end, a Reuters poll showed last Thursday. 

Data on Friday showed that Canada's economy expanded in the second quarter at an annualized rate of 3.7%, the fastest pace since the second quarter of 2017. But economists cautioned that the latest growth figures were unlikely to ease the Bank of Canada's worries.

(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst.)

LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Hedge funds are becoming slightly more pessimistic about the outlook for oil and the economy, though position changes remain small owing to the holiday season in North America and Europe.

Fund managers sold a total of 26 million barrels in the six most important futures and options contracts, reducing their net long position to 525 million barrels in the week to Aug. 27.

Funds sold NYMEX and ICE WTI (-20 million barrels), U.S. diesel (-4 million) and European gasoil (-5 million) though they were smaller buyers of Brent (+4 million) and left U.S. gasoline positions basically unchanged.

Since 2013, when the time series starts for all six major contracts, the hedge fund community has always run a ""structural"" net long position in petroleum, concentrated in Brent and WTI.

In this period, fund managers have NEVER been net short of either crude contract in the last six years, even when prices were plunging in 2014/15 (graphic).

Much of this structural net long position represents passive index-tracking positions as well as the predisposition of fund managers to be bullish towards their own asset class.

Across all six petroleum contracts, the structural net long has been equivalent to around 491 million barrels (consisting of 587 million barrels of structural long positions minus 96 million barrels of structural shorts).

Since structural positions do not change, in aggregate, it is more useful to focus on the remaining ""dynamic"" positions, which have a closer relationship with short-term price changes.

Hedge fund managers are currently running a dynamic net long position of just 35 million barrels, down from a recent peak of 420 million in April.

In effect, fund managers are neutral on the outlook for prices, with concern about the economy and oil consumption offsetting production restraint by Saudi Arabia and U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela.

Until economic uncertainty is resolved, either with clearer signs of recession or indications of renewed growth, portfolio managers are likely to remain on the sidelines.","Hedge funds cautious on oil, wait for economy - Nasdaq.com",https://www.nasdaq.com/article/hedge-funds-cautious-on-oil-wait-for-economy-20190903-00544

Whichever side of the political aisle you are on, the new polls coming out about the 2020 presidential election look misleading. A new Gallup poll released this week showed that Biden has a 54% to 38% lead over Trump. Furthermore, the poll found that any of the 5 top Democratic contenders would beat Trump in the election were they to win the bid. Additionally, 37% of voters reported that they felt the economy was worsening versus 31% who said it was improving, the first time recently that Americans have been pessimistic about the economic outlook.

FINSUM : The polls don't seem to be doing justice to how close this election feels. They just don't reconcile for us. That said, the numbers on economic sentiment are quite interesting.

2019-09-02 17:00:00,"We're now two-thirds of the way through 2019, and the market's volatility continues to deliver hundreds of winners -- and hundreds of losers -- weekly. Last week nearly 550 stocks on the three major U.S. exchanges hit 52-week highs for the week. Even in a volatile market with so many stocks bottoming out there always seem to be top stocks worth buying .

Dunkin' Brands (NASDAQ: DNKN) , Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) , and Fastly (NYSE: FSLY) are three of the names hitting new all-time highs this past week. Each of the three stocks has a unique story to tell, but the one thing that they have in common is that they're all paying off for investors right now.

Image source: Dunkin' Brands.

The company behind Dunkin' Donuts may seem like an odd fit at the top. Health-conscious consumers are in theory staying away from Dunkin's sugary sweets, and an old-school doughnut shop wouldn't seem to have the trendy appeal of more nimble upstarts.

Growth is also less than impressive at Dunkin' Brands. Revenue rose a mere 2.5% in its latest quarter , fueled largely by expansion and a 1.7% uptick in comps at its U.S. stores. The good news is that its adjusted net income is growing a lot faster.

Dunkin' is trying to earn these sugary gains. The pace of new store openings is accelerating, and Dunkin' is updating the experience to include drive-through lanes for mobile orders when possible, digital order boards, and more modern interior designs. Dunkin' is also widening its reach beyond its namesake doughnuts and signature coffee. It's not just sandwiches anymore, as burrito bowls recently became a limited-time menu offering.

One of this year's hottest stocks is Roku. The shares have nearly quintupled this year, going from $30.64 to $151.36. Investors are hopping on the Roku train as the company transforms itself from a slow-growing maker of hardware that gets TVs online to a fast-growing leader in the software that fuels online streaming experiences.

Revenue skyrocketed 59% in its latest quarter . There are now 30.5 million active accounts leaning on the Roku TV operating system as the hub of their surfing through thousands of available streaming services. Roku TV is a free platform, but it cashes in on advertising as well as royalties paid to it by the premium services. Roku's monster year isn't a surprise given the acceleration of its growth and how the narrative has changed in the eyes of investors. The shock here is that folks figuring that it would only double, triple, or quadruple as the year played out have been left behind.

One of this summer's more refreshing IPO turnaround stories is Fastly. The cloud-based provider of faster content delivery went public at $16 in May, only to bottom out as a broken IPO at $14.12 in mid-August. The stock had gone on to soar 147% by the time it hit an all-time high on Thursday, a spectacular return in just a little more than two weeks.

Fastly had a thin float when it hit the market, and that has only gotten leaner as an investment firm has gobbled up nearly a third of the IPO shares. Fastly's edge cloud platform is growing in popularity. Revenue rose 38% in 2018, climbing 37% through the first half of this year. The shares will continue to be volatile given the limited float, but growth always seems to win out in situations like the one we're seeing here. Keep those seat belts buckled.

The government is targeting a deficit of 6.2% in the 2020/2021 fiscal year, Finance Minister Mohamed Maait said at a business conference in Cairo.

The country is targeting a primary surplus of 124 billion Egyptian pounds ($7.51 billion) in the 2019/2020 fiscal year, he said. It had a primary surplus of 104 billion pounds last fiscal year, equivalent to 2% of GDP.

More than $10 billion in hot money exited Egypt last fiscal year during the emerging markets crisis, Maait said.

2019-09-01 23:46:02,"A state of happiness cannot be pinpointed on a map. But a great deal of residents seem to have found it in these 10 places, according to the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index.

Digital health company Sharecare, working with Gallup, has conducted more than 2.6 million surveys nationwide since 2008 to gauge ""Americans' perceptions of their lives and their daily experiences."" The Well-Being Index is based specifically on residents' feelings about five elements of well-being: ""purpose"" (liking what you do and being motivated to achieve goals), ""social"" (having supportive relationships and love), ""financial"" (managing your budget to feel secure), ""community"" (liking where you live) and ""physical"" (being in good health). The higher the score, on a scale of 0 to 100, the happier residents indicate they are about where and how they are living their lives.

To come up with our original list of the 50 best places to retire in the U.S. --one in each state--we factored in the ""community"" and ""physical"" components of the Well-Being Index, where available, as well as living costs, safety, median incomes and poverty rates for retirement-age residents and the availability of recreational and health care facilities. The following 10 retirement destinations rank the highest in terms of the overall well-being of residents. See if you agree, and consider whether any might make a happy place for your own retirement.

Well-being score: 63.0 (U.S.: 61.8)

City population: 42,453

Share of population 65+: 10.7%

Cost of living for retirees: 16.4% above the national average

Average income for population 65+: n/a

State's tax rating for retirees: Least Tax Friendly

This small mountain city on the shores of Lake Champlain is a picturesque setting for tree-hugging retirees. Outdoor recreation is plentiful with miles of hiking and biking paths, nearby beaches where you can swim, kayak or paddleboard in the warmer months, and numerous skiing options in the area. An eco-friendly vibe permeates the town, from the businesses bolstering the city's economy, such as household-products maker Seventh Generation, to the local food movement feeding the neighborhood.

But being green isn't easy on your wallet. Taxes and living costs are high. While the median home value is a low $206,000 in the Green Mountain State, compared with the median $229,000 for the U.S., it climbs to $326,500 in Burlington. A private room in a metro area nursing home costs a median $11,498 a month, compared with $8,365 a month for the U.S. At least you can save money on academic pursuits. The University of Vermont will cover tuition costs for state residents age 65 and older who wish to take a class, even if it's for credit.

For the Vanguard Small-Cap Growth ETF (Symbol: VBK), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $212.12 per unit.      With VBK trading at a recent price near $185.00 per unit, that means that analysts see 14.66% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of VBK's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Keane Group Inc (Symbol: FRAC), Air Transport Services Group, Inc. (Symbol: ATSG), and Wright Medical Group NV (Symbol: WMGI). Although FRAC has traded at a recent price of $5.30/share, the average analyst target is 107.45% higher at $10.99/share. Similarly, ATSG has 43.56% upside from the recent share price of $20.20 if the average analyst target price of $29.00/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting WMGI to reach a target price of $29.57/share, which is 41.83% above the recent price of $20.85.

Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

Quickly, name a sector that Wall Street hates right now. Auto stocks should come to mind. The car industry is in a sales downturn and is in the midst of broader upheaval brought on by electric cars, new competitors, and changing ownership patterns. The Nasdaq Auto Index is down almost 20% in the last year. However, all the changes have created an opportunity to buy into the sector, but not in car companies themselves. Instead it is high tech car suppliers that look attractive as they have a unique niche to fill in the changing industry. Check out Aptiv, Visteon, and BorgWarner.

2019-09-03 16:32:00," The stock market sank on Tuesday, sent lower by rising trade   conflict between the U.S. and China. The latest round of tariffs   took effect over the weekend, and a permanent solution seems   further away than ever right now even as the global economy   continues to show signs of slowing. Some companies had   particularly bad news that sent their shares sharply lower.   Generac Holdings    (NYSE: GNRC) ,   Cleveland-Cliffs    (NYSE: CLF) , and   Napco Security Technologies    (NASDAQ: NSSC) were among the worst performers. Here's why they   did so poorly. Generac loses some of its Dorian bump Shares of Generac Holdings fell more than 5%, giving up much   of their gains from last week as investors watched the likely   path of Hurricane Dorian. Previously, it appeared that Florida   might make a direct hit from the storm, and   historically    , major storms have led to massive sales of Generac's home power   generators. Dorian is still a threat, but the likelihood of its   grazing the Southeast coast probably won't have as big of an   upward impact on Generac sales. Even with the drop, Generac   shares are still up about 50% so far in 2019.   Image source: Generac Holdings.makeArticleAd();  Cleveland-Cliffs can't satisfy shareholders  Cleveland-Cliffs saw its stock drop nearly   15%    despite announcing what most investors would normally see as good   news. The company said that it would boost its regular quarterly   dividend by 20% to $0.06 per share, and it also declared a   special dividend of $0.04 per share on top of that.

The stock market sank on Tuesday, sent lower by rising trade   conflict between the U.S. and China. The latest round of tariffs   took effect over the weekend, and a permanent solution seems   further away than ever right now even as the global economy   continues to show signs of slowing. Some companies had   particularly bad news that sent their shares sharply lower.   Generac Holdings    (NYSE: GNRC) ,   Cleveland-Cliffs    (NYSE: CLF) , and   Napco Security Technologies    (NASDAQ: NSSC) were among the worst performers. Here's why they   did so poorly.

Shares of Generac Holdings fell more than 5%, giving up much   of their gains from last week as investors watched the likely   path of Hurricane Dorian. Previously, it appeared that Florida   might make a direct hit from the storm, and   historically    , major storms have led to massive sales of Generac's home power   generators. Dorian is still a threat, but the likelihood of its   grazing the Southeast coast probably won't have as big of an   upward impact on Generac sales. Even with the drop, Generac   shares are still up about 50% so far in 2019.

 Cleveland-Cliffs saw its stock drop nearly   15%    despite announcing what most investors would normally see as good   news. The company said that it would boost its regular quarterly   dividend by 20% to $0.06 per share, and it also declared a   special dividend of $0.04 per share on top of that. Yet as a   producer of iron ore, Cleveland-Cliffs relies on a healthy steel   market to support the companies it supplies with raw materials   for steel production. When tariffs present obstacles to free   trade in the steel market, it often causes investors to get more   concerned not just about steel producers but also the companies   like Cleveland-Cliffs that supply them with iron ore and   metallurgical coal.

Boeing news for Tuesday about another possible delay to the 737 Max coming back has BA stock down.

According to recent reports, Boeing (NYSE: BA ) may not be able to get the 737 Max line back in the sky for the holidays. That would be a major hit to the company as it would cause disruptions throughout one of the most busy times of the year.

So what's the reason behind this Boeing news. It looks like regulators with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) aren't happy with Boeing. Reports claim that the company hasn't been working well with the FAA when it comes to getting approval for the return of the 737 Max.

The FAA does note that there isn't a timeline in place for when the 737 Max will come back. Instead, it is just focusing on making sure Boeing makes the appropriate changes to the aircraft. Some airlines believe the issues could keep the 737 Max on the ground until 2020, reports CNBC .

The Boeing 737 Max was grounded following two fatal crashes involving the aircraft. That includes one that took place in March. Ethiopian Airline was using the plane that crashed then and it happened shortly after the plane took off. This saw all of the 157 people on board the plane die as a result.

BA stock was down 3% as of Tuesday afternoon. However, the stock is still up 12% since the start of the year.

As of this writing, William White did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Investors tend to go to the same old ports to ride out the storm of a recession-gold, Treasuries, healthcare, utilities etc. However, finding a new safe haven can be not only the means to good protection, but also solid capital appreciation. With that in mind here is a very unglamorous, but potentially lucrative idea-buy garbage stocks. We don't mean bad stocks, we mean stocks of solid waste companies, like Waste Management, Waste Connections, and Casella Waste Systems. Garbage companies are highly recession tolerant (it is not as if there is less garbage), and they tend to throw off huge amounts of free cash flow. Michael Hoffman, an analyst at Stifel is recommending these shares.

FINSUM : This seems like a very good recession hedge. Garbage is a very durable sector. Will this be the next recession star?

First, they chat about smart speakers. The U.S. marketplace is starting to look a little tapped out on the smart-speaker front, and producers are seeking growth elsewhere. As a result, Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU)  is coming in hot as a top seller. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , unfortunately, still hasn't cracked the market in any meaningful way. What Apple has cracked, though, is wearables, where the Watch dominates the competition. Tune in to learn where both of these market spaces are going, what the trends mean for the future, how companies like Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) , Fitbit (NYSE: FIT) , and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG)  fit in, how product differentiation can make or break these producers, and more.

Dylan Lewis: Welcome to Industry Focus , the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. It's Friday, August 30th, and we are checking in on the smart speaker and wearables markets. I'm your host, Dylan Lewis, and I've got fool.com 's Evan Niu with me on Skype. Evan, how are you doing, man?

Evan Niu: Pretty good! Fun fact, Warren Buffett and I have the same birthday. That's today.

Lewis: What a wonderful thing! We're pre-recording today's show. It's Thursday. We're trying to get ahead of the holiday weekend, get a little early start. I'm going to give you an early, rather than a belated, birthday greeting. When this goes live, listeners, if you feel like giving Evan a shout out on Twitter , feel free to. You're my favorite person of the famous people that have birthdays today, Evan.

Niu: Oh, more than Buffett? He tends to overshadow me a little bit, because he is quite a bit more famous than I am.

Lewis: Yeah, but I don't have a personal relationship with him, and I have a personal relationship with you, and I value that. [laughs] Alright, today we are talking about some updated data on two relatively new tech markets, specifically consumer tech markets. That's the smart speaker and wearables markets. This is primarily going to be based on research from a firm, Canalys. They are one of the leading researchers. They really have a finger on the pulse for what's going on.

Why don't we start out talking about smart speakers? Canalys dropped their unit sales numbers, and there's really no surprise. The top of the list is Amazon. This is a category, Evan, that they have absolutely dominated over the last couple of years.

Niu: Right. I would even go as far as to say that they created the category. When they came out with their Echo way back when, that was such a revolutionary device. It created this entire new category of smart speakers that people like to use with their voices, tap into Alexa to control their smart home devices, listen to music streaming, all sorts of stuff. They have been able to maintain their lead. Only a couple of times have they blipped into a No. 2 spot. But for the most part, they're always No. 1 by a healthy margin.

Lewis: For them, business as usual. I think they sold about 6.6 million shipments during Q2, good for about 25% of the market. Even with more people coming into the space, they maintain their market share, which is pretty impressive. We've talked about it quite a bit on the show before, but it's worth mentioning, the smart speaker strategy for them, it's not a consumer hardware play. I mean, sure, they love selling these things. They probably sell them at or near cost, maybe a small margin there. But the reality is that this is plugging into a much larger ecosystem play for Amazon. It's not so much about the devices.

Niu: Right. They want you to buy things with your voice, Prime members. Ideally, they want you to use Amazon music streaming, but in reality, probably not very many people do. But they do definitely have a pretty good smart home ecosystem as well, which I think entrenches people and gets them behaviorally used to using Alexa.

Lewis: There was a bit of a surprise looking at the No. 2 player in the space by shipments. At 4.5 million shipments, Baidu took silver. I think it's worth emphasizing how far out of left field Baidu came this quarter. They grew shipments 3,700% year over year, which basically means that they had like 100,000 shipments in Q2 of 2018. That's pretty incredible.

Niu: Right. It is coming off a very small base, because they were barely in the market a year ago. But over the past year to 18 months, they've been putting out a bunch of these different types of devices. A lot of different form factors. They're doing some smart displays, also some smaller, portable speakers. Kind of like what Amazon's doing with releasing a bunch of different things at different price points, different form factors, to offer something for everyone.

Lewis: Looking at China broadly, some of the other big players, the names that people know, Alibaba and Xiaomi , both of them also on the list for major manufacturers. They're in fourth and fifth by units respectively. China's seeing a pretty crazy growth story with smart speakers. You go back to late 2017, and the market was just getting started. According to numbers from Canalys, they're about 50% of global shipments right now.

Niu: I think they're a little bit more than that. China overtook the U.S. earlier this year as the largest smart speaker market in the world by unit volumes. I think that is still true today. The U.S. market is maturing, so it's showing a little bit of weakness. Their numbers show that the U.S. market dipped 2% or something. Nothing too scary, but not growing as quickly as places like China, where adoption is soaring, and it has a much larger market by population, and they're just now starting to get on this trend.

Lewis: I think even for Amazon, and Google, who was formerly the No. 2 best seller by units, most of -- I think about half, 50% -- of their unit sales are international sales. So, when we see the U.S. market start to mature a little bit, you mentioned that small dip that we saw year over year, they are going elsewhere to find growth. Amazon was able to do that. Looking at the data, it looks like Google's actually one of the only major suppliers that experienced a year over year drop.

Niu: Right. They're definitely looking outside the U.S. now to look for growth elsewhere. Although, both Amazon and Google don't have good inroads into China. It's tough for them because it is such a big market, which is why we see these Chinese companies, like you mentioned earlier, climbing these charts. They're able to capitalize on all that demand in China.

Lewis: Baidu definitely stole the show, at least from my perspective, looking at all this data. You look at the strategy, it's very similar to Amazon. Smart speakers are not the core thesis for Baidu. If you're looking at the revenue contribution here, they lump all this into other revenues, as a lot of other major tech firms do, which is the most frustrating thing in the world if you're trying to pinpoint what's going on with the financials. The other stuff that's in there -- cloud services, and then they have the revenue from their streaming property, iQiyi . All told, that other revenue segment is about a quarter of revenue, but it grew 44% year over year in the most recent quarter. The core business, some of their online marketing, actually dipped. This is giving them some growth when they're otherwise struggling, but the reality is, like Amazon, the devices help them get more embedded with consumers. It's not so much that they are the end all, be all for this business.

Niu: Right, exactly. And it is frustrating, in terms of investor transparency, but that's why we have to rely on these third party research estimates from companies like Canalys that give us as investors some data to actually go through to understand how this market is developing. It's really grown a lot. Total unit volumes were up like 55% up to like 26 million. Overall, we're still seeing a lot of really good growth numbers on a global basis.

Lewis: There's one company that we would typically expect to have mentioned in a discussion about consumer technology noticeably absent from this discussion so far. That's Apple. It's wild to think, we're talking about all the big tech names, talking about a lot of companies that traditionally are strong in hardware, Apple's not mentioned. Samsung 's not mentioned, either.

Niu: Apple has really dropped the ball on the smart speaker stuff, in my opinion. And pretty badly. Their whole thing has always been, ""We don't want to be first, we just want to be best,"" and they don't care if they're a little bit late to a market. But in this case, I think that the other players in that timeframe, when Apple was taking so long to come out with HomePod, these other companies were able to get in there and entrench themselves into people's homes. The whole idea of these smart speakers is, you have one in every room, you have multiple units all over the house. So, over time, people have been buying more Alexas, more Google Homes, and the Chinese brands, too, and putting them all over the house. Once you have all these, you're not going to go out and buy five or 10 more HomePods, which by themselves are extremely expensive. At the same time, Siri is not as capable as Alexa in terms of some of these capabilities. So, I really think they dropped the ball pretty badly. I don't see them coming back, frankly, in a meaningful way.

Lewis: Yeah. I think it's really hard, if you're a consumer, to look out at something that you're not 100% sold on the use case for -- in the case of a smart speaker -- and maybe something that you want to test first, and say, ""Yeah, I'll go out there and buy a $300 product."" I think most people are willing to make that leap with something that costs $50, $75. But to drop $300 when Siri has not necessarily been the greatest smart assistant out there is a bit of a stretch, and that bears it out in the unit shipments that we see.

The one counter argument I'll mention is that Apple does have the ability to have a device in most people's pockets, particularly in the United States. They have such great penetration in the U.S. smartphone market that, if they are able to make Siri better, there may be some voice assistant play that they may be able to do there, rather than have to have something installed in every single room in the house.

Niu: Right. They're reportedly working on a smaller, more affordable version of the HomePod that might be coming out in the next year or two. I think that's going to be a pretty key point for them, try to get in there with affordable devices. They really went high with this HomePod at $350. It's come down in price since then, but basically, they were betting on really high fidelity, audiophile quality sound, which average consumers don't care about. To your point, when this stuff all came out people we're sure. To test it out for $100, like the Echoes, was much more approachable than trying to drop $350 on a HomePod. We'll see if the mini does any better, we'll see how it's priced, we'll see if they pull back away from the high fidelity approach to it. But that's going to be their only chance.

Lewis: Yeah, I think that this difference really speaks to the different business strategies for the likes of Apple, who is a primarily consumer hardware oriented company, and Amazon or Google, where Amazon, Google can very comfortably know that they are going to be the platform business. They have the e-commerce; they have the media. They have all these different things that they can then throw right on top of an installed base. Apple has that, to some extent, but it's a much smaller portion of the pie. Most of their money's coming from devices. If they're going to sell devices, and they're generally a premium product business, they need to have that across their entire portfolio.

Niu: Right. I think, more broadly, it's also an open question of, how are these third-party developers going to be able to monetize their services on these platforms? That's also still a pretty nascent aspect of this broader trend, too. Most of the stuff that people do on these devices, you're not paying for subscriptions for an Alexa skill. Or, most people aren't. They do have some out there. But the vast majority of people are doing the built-in stuff. As that monetization stuff develops, maybe that'll present Apple with an opportunity. They are typically pretty good with helping their developers monetize services and subscriptions on their digital platforms.

Lewis: OK, Evan, smart speakers aren't the only devices we're going to talk about today. We've also got an update on wearables. Also from Canalys. We're very grateful for all the work they do in market research. Why don't you kick us off there?

Niu: They put out some numbers earlier this month on the North American wearables market. It's now hit $2 billion in revenue, total value. Unit volumes are up about 38% to 7.7 million. Again, seeing some pretty strong growth numbers here in terms of units. The North American market is the most valuable in the world by revenue, although China is growing a lot, too. They're actually the biggest in unit volumes. The big difference is that a lot of the units in China are these basic wearable tracker bands, whereas North America is becoming dominated by smart watches, which cost a lot more money. That's how you can make sense of that discrepancy there. Apple is, naturally, in first place because of the Apple Watch. That's the most popular smartwatch in the world. Fitbit comes in at No. 2. They've maintained that position for quite a while. Samsung was No. 3 with some of their new products, like the Galaxy Watch Active.

Lewis:  I think for a long time, this market has been in price discovery mode a little bit. We've known that there's interest on the low end, especially with those bands that Xiaomi puts out that are like $10 or $20. And we know that there's some interest with the base level Fitbit devices. Those were extremely popular. Kind of a category creator, really. But for a while, I think these companies have struggled with understanding where they price those mid and high-tier smart watches.

Niu: Right. There's been a lot going on. The whole market has been evolving. A lot of moving parts here. As you mentioned, it started off with these basic trackers, really low-cost, really cheap. Now, it's transitioning toward this more full-function, multi-feature smart watches that cost more but can do a whole lot more. At the same time there's pricing all across both fitness trackers and smart watches. So, yeah, the market is getting closer to finding those right price points that tap into mainstream demand.

Fitbit is still on the cheaper end. For example, they're in the $100 to $200 range with their Versa. Samsung's in the $200 to $300 range with their products. Apple's at the high end with their Apple Watch Series 4, which starts at $400 and goes all the way up to $1,500, which is more than a MacBook Pro, which is wild. They also have the previous generation, Series 3, which is available for less than $300. I think what we're seeing right now is, the vast majority of units, 60% of the market, is in this $200 to $400 price band.

Lewis: When we talk consumer devices, we're always mindful of what upgrade cycles look like. I think one of the reasons why the smart speaker market stalled a little bit most recently is because the people that tended to buy early generation devices are still using those early generation devices. Maybe they're adding other ones to them to build out how many they have in their home, but by and large, they haven't hit that refresh point yet. I was wondering where that was going to happen with wearables as well. It seems like these companies are adding functionality, and that's what's driving a lot of the growth, because a lot of these devices still work.

Niu: Right, exactly. That's a good point with the smart speakers. Smart speakers, the technology hasn't really changed as quickly over the past couple of years compared to something like wearables, where a big driver right now is cellular connectivity and having a lot of health information on the smartwatch. I was actually skeptical back when Apple first put cellular into the Apple Watch. I didn't think it was that necessary. The smartwatch doesn't use that much data, but it still costs an extra $5 or $10 on your monthly bill. But, it turns out that has been a big demand driver, and people really do like that connectivity. Apple has marketed the LTE connection very well. They basically pitch it as a way to free the Apple Watch from the iPhone, use it as an independent device that can stream music, make calls, text, it actually has GPS built into it so you can leave your phone at home if you want to go out on a run. They really took the lead in terms of the cellular connectivity, and that is paying off pretty well for them.

Lewis: Let's talk Fitbit a little bit here. This seems like the company that is best positioned to capitalize on growth in an industry. They created the category, and they have some of the more accessible lower-price options that still have decent functionality. And yet, it seems like this business just can't quite figure it out.

Niu: Yeah, they can't really quite get their footing, even though they're such a prominent player. They do play both sides of it. They do the basic fitness trackers as well as the smart watches. Apple only does the smart watches. They've been transitioning to get onto the smartwatch bandwagon. But at the same time, they don't want to abandon their fitness tracker business, because there are many parts of the world -- like China and other emerging markets -- where basic trackers are still really popular, particularly in like the Middle East, for example, too. So, they have to do both while navigating this transition, and competing with Apple on smart watches. They had a pretty high profile flop recently with the Versa Lite. They recently actually had to cut their full-year forecasts on revenue because this device is not selling well. They attribute it to a different pricing strategy that didn't really work out. It was priced lower, but it turns out that people actually prefer to just hunt for discounts on the standard version that has more features. And a lot of times, those promotions will bring it down to the same price, anyways. So, they misread the market a little bit, and now they're starting to realize that, and adjust their strategy.

Lewis: It seems like the market has been looking at this company and saying, like, ""Oh, they might be figuring it out! Nope, nope, we're seeing numbers that don't quite back it up yet."" We've gotten this, ""Alright, we're trying new things."" And it bears it out in the way the stock has traded, and the valuation that the company has earned, up until recently. We're seeing it now at levels that it hasn't been seen in quite some time. I think the current market cap for the business is under $800 million. Are you excited when you see some of the things that management's doing now? Or does it stay in the same place for you, where they're in ""figuring it out"" mode and they haven't proven that they've been able to do it in the past?

Niu: I'm still in ""wait and see."" I mean, they're at all-time lows. The stock is like $3 a share. They just announced a new version of the Versa, which has been their most popular smartwatch to date, with a bunch of minor improvements like better battery life, Alexa support, OLED display, that kind of stuff. But I think the bigger picture is that consumer electronics is a tough market. Preferences are fickle and always changing. Something you mentioned before, if you look at Fitbit's track record, the first thing they came out with was Ionic. It flopped. The Versa was next. It was a hit. The Versa Lite was next. It's a flop. Now it's Versa 2. It's just back and forth, back and forth. You don't know what's going to resonate and what's not. They haven't figured it out yet, either. I think that presents a lot of uncertainty to investors, because they haven't shown this consistent ability to come out with products that sell well.

Lewis: The thing that would convince people -- at least, convince me -- more than anything else is, we have a hardware business, and, on top of that, we're putting in a very successful platform business. It seems like there's always the possibility for that. I haven't seen the execution there. You think about the amount of money that goes into fitness regimens and workout plans and all that kind of stuff. Peloton, a company that will be going public soon, has tapped into that in a way. They sell the device, but they're really making a lot of their money on membership. It's always seemed like Fitbit has been able to do that, but hasn't quite gotten the execution right. I think until they're able to, I'm always going to be waiting.

Niu: I agree completely. They've been trying for years to get into the services stuff. And even before they went public, they had bought FitStar, which they had all these big plans about turning into a subscription business and all this stuff. Even to this day, subscription services for consumers is still less than 1% of total revenue. They haven't made any progress over the years. They just announced Fitbit Premium this week, which is $10 a month and offers personalized health and fitness type of stuff. But, again, I don't have a whole lot of confidence that they'll be able to pull it off in execution because they've been doing this for so long.

That being said, they do have another health solutions segment, which is more targeting enterprises, corporate wellness programs, things like that. That is starting to show some signs of growth. They're forecasting that to reach $100 million in revenue this year, which would be about 7% of the total business. There's some progress on the services in terms of enterprise. Still, nothing on the consumer side. We just have to wait and see if they can finally pull it off.

Lewis: The reason we want to see that's twofold. There's the financial impact of having generally higher margin and more predictable platform revenue coming in, but also, if you go from a point where you're only selling devices, and that's where all your money is coming from, to a point where people are paying to access apps or wellness programs or what have you on your platform, well, their next fitness device is probably also going to be a Fitbit. This is what has made Apple so successful with the iPhone. And it makes it a lot easier for them to predict success with their device sales. They feed each other really well. Until they're able to do that, I think they're going to continue to run into these series, where they have a great release, and then a ho-hum release that follows.

Niu: Yeah, exactly. They're trying to diversify away from relying so much on hardware, which they've always done in the past. They've said that they're going to accelerate their development cycles to get onto this annual cadence of refreshing on an annual basis -- which, of course, is not unlike what Apple does. It gives them a little bit more visibility, helps them smooth out the seasonality, or at least plan better for the seasonality of it, because the consumer electronics market is so reliant on upgrades, and what's the newest thing, consumers want the newest, shiniest thing. So, being able to come out with that in a regular cadence is what they need to do. But, at the same time, because they haven't proven the ability to consistently do that, that's why they're trying to turn to the services stuff, to smooth it out on the other side of the business.

Lewis: I think every time we've checked in on this company, we've been doubtfully watching from the sidelines. It sounds like that story continues, Evan.

Niu: Yeah, pretty much. I've never really had an interest in touching the stock. I think it's very interesting because the market itself of wearables is interesting. But I'm still not interested.

Lewis:  Yeah, I am right there with you. Thank you for pre-taping today! I hope you have a really nice birthday on Friday!

2019-09-03 10:52:00,"LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson lost his working majority in parliament on Tuesday when one of his Conservative lawmakers defected to the pro-European Union Liberal Democrats.

Phillip Lee crossed the floor of the House of Commons just as Johnson began giving a statement on last month's G7 summit.

LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Britain's currency tumbled below $1.20  on Tuesday, the first time it has breached that level since a ""flash crash"" in October 2016, as fears over Brexit and a possible general election escalated sharply. 

If that flash crash is excluded, sterling is now trading back at levels not seen since 1985, creating confusion on Tuesday about where the pound is now positioned historically and what new lows it clocked as UK political uncertainty deepens.

SO WHAT HAPPENED IN OCTOBER 2016?

Flash crashes are events in which a currency undergoes a sudden, dramatic and often quickly-reversed price swing. They usually occur when market depth is thin and a buy or sell order - sometimes an accidental one - cascades into a violent market move.

Back in October 2016, three months after Britain voted to leave the European Union, sterling lost almost a tenth of its value in minutes in Asia trading, hitting a low on the Refinitiv trading system of $1.1491. It also shed more than 6% versus the euro to 94.03 pence , some way from Tuesday's levels of 91.47 pence.

The flash crash lows were later confirmed by Thomson Reuters, then owner of the foreign exchange trading platform with the biggest market share for trading the pound. That platform is now majority owned by Refinitiv.

Prices on other platforms may differ, but Refinitiv's is the most widely followed for trading in the British currency.

WHY DOES IT MATTER?

Given the flash crash low was so brief and quickly reversed, some might think it would be better to exclude such an event altogether. Doing so would generate headlines that the pound had fallen to levels not seen since the middle of former Conservative leader Margaret Thatcher's 11 years as premier.

But analysts said that the flash crash low is a recognised price used for setting financial derivative contracts. Although inquiries were vague about the triggers for the crash - some cited Brexit-related headlines hitting in highly illiquid trading hours - central bankers who investigated the plunge agreed that the pound traded at the sub-$1.15 level.

Lows and highs matter in the global forex industry, because investors often line up their bets to happen when such levels are breached.

""I think $1.15 in any case is an obvious magnet for GBP bears in the context of Brexit and the perception/angst of how low cable can drop in the worst case event of a 'no deal' or new elections and a (Labour leader Jeremy) Corbyn government,"" said Kenneth Broux, an FX strategist at Societe Generale.

None of this is to downplay the significance of sterling's recent rout. 

Should the pound plummet further and breach the 2016 low of $1.1491, the British currency would be in territory only seen during a few months in late 1984 and early 1985.

The all-time low was $1.0545 touched in March 1985, just before G7 powers acted to rein in the superdollar of the Reagan era in the so-called ""Plaza Accord"".

It's a level some investors believe would be tested in the panicked aftermath of a no-deal Brexit, with parity against both euro and dollar far from out of the question.

2019-09-03 09:21:00," Summer is unofficially over and traders are back in business after an extended Labor Day break. But, September is historically the worst month for the stock market. And this September, particularly, can be a tough one as it follows a volatile August. Trade-related uncertainties and economic slowdown are primarily responsible for the market's volatile streak. Given such bearishness, investors should pick stocks that have a steady stream of customers, irrespective of market conditions.  September: Typically Rocky for Stocks  Stocks tend to wobble in September. According to Dow Jones Market Data, since 1937, both the S&P 500 and the Dow averaged a loss of 1%. The Nasdaq Composite, as incepted in 1971, averaged a loss of 0.5%. CFRA added that the broader S&P 500 has averaged a 1% decline, particularly, in September since 1946. What's more, September is gloomier after a downbeat August. It was a wild month for the stock market, with the S&P 500, the Dow and the Nasdaq registering a loss of 1.8%, 1.7% and 2.6%, respectively. By the way, this marked the worst August performance for the bourses since 2015. And whenever S&P 500 has lost more than 1.5% in August, the Dow declined an average 1.1% in September, while the Nasdaq has saw an average drop of 0.8%. The S&P 500, itself, continued its losing run, falling 0.9%.  What Happened in August?  Escalating trade tensions and signs of a recession dealt a heavy blow to stocks during August. The S&P 500 declined at least 2.6% three times during August, while the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), better known as fear gauge index, traded as high as 24.81 before pulling back to around 18. The U.S.-China trade tussle intensified last month after President Trump urged American firms to start looking for an ""alternative to China."" Trouble began after China announced plans of imposing tariffs of 5% and 10% on nearly $75 billion of U.S. products. Beijing clarified that the move was due to the Trump administration's intention to impose 10% tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese imports. Trump, in the meantime, reacted to China's decision by saying that the United States will increase tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods to 30% from an earlier 25%. And tariffs on additional $300 billion imports from China would go up to 15% from 10%. Meanwhile, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield's fall below the 2-year Treasury yield added to the bearish sentiments. With the 10-year rate below the 2-year note, fixed income traders are expecting a slowdown in the near term. Lest we forget, the 2-year yield has always surpassed the 10-year note in every slowdown over the past 50 years. So, what led to the inverted yield curve? Thanks to the ever-changing China-trade narrative, the stock market continues to gyrate, compelling investors to pull money out of equities and opt for safe-haven government bonds, eventually leading to a decline in the 10-year Treasury yield. After all, bond yields tend to move opposite to prices.  Things Not Rosy This September  U.S.-China trade war, in fact, shows no signs of cooling down this month. Tariffs of 15% on $112 billion of Chinese goods have been put into effect on Sep 1, as did retaliatory Chinese tariffs on U.S. commodities, including crude-oil imports. Now, nearly two-thirds of the consumer goods that the United States imports from China will face higher taxes. Americans have to pay more for items like shoes, clothes and sporting goods. Trump's higher tariffs will now impact consumer spending, which has been one of the driving factors for the economy. Needless to say, business houses have lowered spending and exports have slowed down in the face of weak global growth. Both Washington and Beijing are struggling to de-escalate the trade war, with the United States accusing China of stealing trade secrets and unfairly subsidizing its own companies to make headway into high-tech fields such as AI and electric cars.  5 Best Stocks to Buy in September  With things not looking up on the trade front and yield curve remaining inverted, choppy trading sessions are expected to persist this September. However, contrary to popular belief, there are stocks that do well during market gyrations. Prominent among them are defensive stocks. These stocks are generally non-cyclical, or companies whose business performance and sales are not highly correlated with activities in the larger market. Their products are in constant demand, irrespective of market volatility, and such names include companies from the utilities and consumer staples sectors. The idea of investing in ""vice"" stocks can also be considered. After all, products or services in this space are relatively inelastic, and business is slowdown-proof. The very nature of their business ensures a stable stream of consumers, irrespective of market conditions, which eventually leads to higher margins and solid profits. Noteworthy vice stocks include beer and gaming companies. We have, thus, selected five solid stocks from the aforesaid areas that flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).  NRG Energy, Inc.

U.S.-China trade war, in fact, shows no signs of cooling down this month. Tariffs of 15% on $112 billion of Chinese goods have been put into effect on Sep 1, as did retaliatory Chinese tariffs on U.S. commodities, including crude-oil imports.

Now, nearly two-thirds of the consumer goods that the United States imports from China will face higher taxes. Americans have to pay more for items like shoes, clothes and sporting goods. Trump's higher tariffs will now impact consumer spending, which has been one of the driving factors for the economy. Needless to say, business houses have lowered spending and exports have slowed down in the face of weak global growth.

Both Washington and Beijing are struggling to de-escalate the trade war, with the United States accusing China of stealing trade secrets and unfairly subsidizing its own companies to make headway into high-tech fields such as AI and electric cars.

 5 Best Stocks to Buy in September 

With things not looking up on the trade front and yield curve remaining inverted, choppy trading sessions are expected to persist this September. However, contrary to popular belief, there are stocks that do well during market gyrations.

Prominent among them are defensive stocks. These stocks are generally non-cyclical, or companies whose business performance and sales are not highly correlated with activities in the larger market. Their products are in constant demand, irrespective of market volatility, and such names include companies from the utilities and consumer staples sectors.

The idea of investing in ""vice"" stocks can also be considered. After all, products or services in this space are relatively inelastic, and business is slowdown-proof. The very nature of their business ensures a stable stream of consumers, irrespective of market conditions, which eventually leads to higher margins and solid profits. Noteworthy vice stocks include beer and gaming companies.

We have, thus, selected five solid stocks from the aforesaid areas that flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

 NRG Energy, Inc. NRG  is involved in producing, selling, and delivering electricity and related products and services. It has a Zacks Rank #1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 4.9% in the past 30 days. The stock's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 67.7% versus the Utility - Electric Power  industry's estimated rally of 3.2%.

 Unitil Corporation UTL  , a public utility holding company, engages in the distribution of electricity and natural gas in the United States. It has a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has risen 0.9% in the past 60 days. The stock's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 4% versus the Utility - Electric Power industry's projected rally of 3.2%.

 General Mills, Inc. GIS  manufactures and markets branded consumer foods. It has a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has increased 0.9% in the past 90 days. The stock, which is part of the Food - Miscellaneous  industry, is expected to record earnings growth of 8.5% and 4.7% in the current quarter and year, respectively. You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here  . 

 The Boston Beer Company, Inc  . SAM  produces and sells alcohol beverages, primarily in the United States. It has a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up nearly 4% in the past 60 days. The stock's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 19.5% versus the Beverages - Alcohol  industry's anticipated decline of 1.8%.

 Penn National Gaming, Inc. PENN  owns and manages gaming and racing facilities, and operates video gaming terminals with a focus on slot machine entertainment. It has a Zacks Rank #1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has increased 10.5% in the past 60 days. The stock's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 69.9% versus the Gaming  industry's projected rally of 7.7%.

In fact, shares of NRG Energy, Unitil, General Mills, The Boston Beer Company and Penn National Gaming have gained 20.1%, 88.1%, 0.6%, 99.9% and 67.4%, respectively, over the past five-year period. Take a look -

 Legalizing THIS Could Be Even Bigger than   Marijuana 

Americans spend an estimated $150 billion in this industry every year… more than twice as much as they spend on marijuana.

Now that 8 states have fully-legalized it (with several more states following close behind), Zacks has identified 5 stocks that could soar in response to the powerful demand. One industry insider described the future as ""mind-blowing"" - and early investors can still get in ahead of the surge.

2019-09-03 08:15:26,"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the SPDR Russell 1000 Momentum Focus ETF (Symbol: ONEO), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $79.74 per unit.      With ONEO trading at a recent price near $72.09 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.61% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of ONEO's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Liberty Broadband Corp (Symbol: LBRDK), Huntington Bancshares Inc (Symbol: HBAN), and Eagle Materials Inc (Symbol: EXP). Although LBRDK has traded at a recent price of $105.44/share, the average analyst target is 13.49% higher at $119.67/share. Similarly, HBAN has 11.63% upside from the recent share price of $13.25 if the average analyst target price of $14.79/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting EXP to reach a target price of $93.30/share, which is 10.82% above the recent price of $84.19. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of LBRDK, HBAN, and EXP:  makeArticleAd();     Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:       Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

Retail stocks are a tricky buy right now as several factors are weighing on the sector. The trade war between the U.S. and China remains an uncertainty for the majority of retailers, but consumer behavior and a changing landscape has also cast a shadow over several retail sectors. However, that doesn't mean there aren't deals to be had.

Here's a look at 5 retail stocks that should be on your radar now. 

Discount chain Dollar General (NYSE: DG ) is one of the retail stocks that investors should have on their shopping list. There are a lot of reasons to like DG stock, most prominently is the fact that the company is undergoing a major expansion that's likely to drive growth in the near term. DG is aggressively increasing its footprint with plans to open 975 new stores by the end of the year. 

Plus, the firm is building out its fresh offerings in order to increase customer spend and potentially draw in new shoppers. To help with that expansion, the firm is remodeling its existing stores to include cold cases where fresh food can be displayed. That remodel effort is seen increasing same store sales by a minimum of 4% . 

In an effort to further boost its expansion plans, Dollar General partnered with FedEx (NYSE: FDX ) in order to make many of its locations into pickup and drop-off points. That should help bring in customers who might not have otherwise visited a DG location.

Dollar General stock also represents a defensive play should macroeconomic conditions worsen and a recession hits the U.S. Deep discounters like DG are unlikely to be as harshly affected as other retail stocks.

Another firm to consider if you're looking for retail stocks to buy is electronics firm Best Buy (NYSE: BBY ). BBBY stock is down 14% from where it was a year ago and moving into the holiday shopping season the firm looks poised to make a big comeback.

Before I lay out my reason for including Best Buy stock on this list, it's important to acknowledge that the electronics space that BBY operates in is rife with competition. There's a lot of price competition which could weigh on Best Buy's long-term margin expansion. With that said, I still believe BBY is a good bet.

Over the past few years, Best Buy has been on a cost-cutting mission that has eliminated more than $1 billion in annual costs. Management isn't done yet, though - the company plans to raise its operating profit a further $600 million as it revamps its return and replacement procedures. The firm has also been able to create a successful omnichannel experience that allows customers to buy online and ship from in-store. That sets Best Buy apart from some of it's exclusively e-commerce opponents.

This holiday quarter, Best Buy looks ready to run with new e-commerce centers that it says will help it offer free next-day delivery to 50 million customers . BBY has been working to build out its supply chain in order to offer competitive prices and shipping options and this holiday season will prove whether those investments can pay off.

The grocery space has been shifting recently as new entrants like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) give online shopping additional momentum. However, unlike what happened with shopping malls and department stores, grocers have been better prepared to weather the storm and change with the times. Kroger (NYSE: KR ) is one such grocer who has proven to be a winner in the space, even with Amazon gobbling up some of the market share.

KR stock is down nearly 30% from where it was a year ago, largely because of concerns about competition from the likes of Amazon, Target (NYSE: TGT ) and Walmart (NYSE: WMT ). Despite investor fears, Kroger delivered on its first-quarter results in June , proving that the supermarket chain's business was still on firm footing. Worries about the changing landscape of groceries kept the results from inspiring any confidence and Kroger stock continued to slide. 

The bottom line on KR stock is that it's undervalued right now. Investor fears are overdone - Kroger is a best-in-class supermarket that's unlikely to buckle under the pressure of increased competition. The firm has a huge amount of customer data on hand to create targeted promotions and effectively manage inventory and buying. It's size has given it the ability to create an omnichannel experience to keep customers loyal even when they switch to online shopping.

On top of that, KR recently raised its dividend for the 13th consecutive year, demonstrating management's commitment to shareholders. With a yield just shy of 3%, I think KR stock is one of the best retail bargains you can get right now. 

Another grocery retailer that should be on your radar right now is wholesale giant Costco (NASDAQ: COST ). The firm's business model has proven to be iron clad, with its membership dues making up the bulk of its revenue. The firm sells it's goods with a razor thin margins which gives customers confidence that they're getting the best price when they shop. That leads to renewals, which keeps COST stock riding high. Costco's membership renewal rate is upwards of 90% - meaning customers are happy.

And why wouldn't they be? Not only is Costco known for offering low prices, but the firm is also providing an experience for its customers that makes it worth driving to a physical location for. The company switches up some of its merchandise regularly which creates a 'treasure-hunt' feel for bargain shoppers. Plus the firm's sample stations and ultra-cheap cafe keep shoppers engaged in the Costco experience. 

Unlike Kroger, though, Costco does appear to have a major catalyst ahead - growth in China. This week Costco opened its first location in mainland China where the sheer volume of shoppers caused the store to close early. Chinese shoppers waited up to three hours just to park. That says something about the firm's entrance into China and suggests that the US/China trade war has done little to quell Chinese shoppers' enthusiasm about a bargain. 

Tanger Factory Outlet Centers (NYSE: SKT ) stock is, in a way, riskier than the others on this list because the REIT invests in shopping centers that house outlet stores. As there's quite a lot of uncertainty surrounding the future of shopping malls, SKT is inherently risky. However, that doesn't mean it's doomed. 

Tanger has certainly felt the burn of the retail apocalypse and the potential for an economic downturn hasn't helped sentiment any, but at just $13 per share and with a dividend yield of 10%, it's hard to overlook. Yes, Tanger is struggling to grow its income as the popularity of shopping malls declines, but the firm has paired down its portfolio significantly by selling off its less-profitable assets and reinvesting in those that show potential. 

Right now the firm boasts an occupancy rate of 96% , exceptional in the retail space, and more importantly traffic is moving in the right direction. The firm's yield looks safe for now and it's depressed share price makes it worth considering if you've got a strong stomach.  

As of this writing, the author held no positions in the aforementioned securities.

Pimco is probably the most respected name in fixed income, and the firm just went on the record warning about the economy and encouraging the Fed to act. The asset manager argues that the US economy is in worse shape than many think and is admonishing the Fed to cut rates more aggressively than expectations. Pimco says that momentum in the labor market is slowing, the trade war is showing little sign of abating, and the risk of financial excess caused by lower rates appears minimal. According to Pimco, ""We can't emphasise enough that labour market momentum has decelerated more markedly than most forecasters were previously expecting"".

FINSUM : We actually are on the opposite side of the fence as Pimco. We think the market is blowing things out of proportion about the economy and is overly worried. We surely hope we are right.

2019-09-03 08:00:00,"Want to use your credit cards the right way? Here are five important rules you should never break.

Credit cards can be a helpful tool, or they can get you into serious debt that will have a major adverse impact on your financial life. Although some people shy away from credit cards because they're afraid they'll end up too deeply in debt, this isn't always the best approach. Not using credit could mean missing out on important credit card benefits.

Instead, it's a good idea to sign up for a credit card ASAP, and follow these five cardinal rules of smart credit card use.

Image source: Getty Images

Credit cards tend to charge very high interest rates, with some limited exceptions such as cards offering 0% APR promotions . If you don't repay your balance in full when your bill is due, the card company will charge interest. Typically, interest is based on your average daily balance, and it compounds daily. This means that the daily interest charge is added to what you owe, and that you pay interest on your interest.

Paying off your balance to avoid interest charges is imperative if you're going to avoid wasting a ton of money. Although credit card companies charge minimum monthly payments that are equal to just a small percentage of the amount you owe, making only your minimum payments leaves you in debt for years, and adds hundreds or even thousands of dollars to the costs of your purchases. And, as soon as you let a balance start to grow, paying it off just becomes harder next month.

Don't go down this path -- just follow the cardinal rule of paying your balance in full every time.

Not only do you want to pay your bill in full, but you also want to pay it on time. Otherwise, you could hurt your payment history on your credi t report . Payment history is the most important factor that affects your credit -- and a single late payment could result in a reduction of more than 100 points from a good credit score.

To avoid accidentally missing a payment because you forgot to make it, set up autopay to withdraw from your bank account the full amount due (but be sure that doing so won't put you at risk of overdrafting). That way, not only will you never miss a payment, but you'll also never end up carrying a balance you're paying interest on.

When a credit card company gives you a line of credit, don't assume you can spend up to the credit limit without any problems. If you max out your card, you'll hurt your credit utilization ratio. This is the second most important component of your credit score, and it's determined by dividing the amount of credit you've used by your total credit available.

To maintain your best possible credit score, your credit utilization ratio should be no more than 30% and should ideally be even lower. So, with a credit card that has a $1,000 limit, you'd want to charge no more than $300. If you go over this amount, you can expect your credit score to fall until you've paid off what you owe.

If you have a credit card you aren't using any more, it may be tempting to close the account. Unfortunately, this could hurt your credit score in two ways. By closing the account, you lose access to the credit line, which affects your utilization ratio. And, you shorten the average age of your account history, where having a longer account history is better for your credit score.

If the old card has a high annual fee, you may decide to close it anyway and take the hit to your credit score to avoid the cost. But before you do, try calling your creditor to see if they'd be willing to allow you to switch to a free card in their lineup of cards, and keep your card history in tact.

Finally, the last cardinal rule of being a smart credit card user is to get as many rewards as you can. You can do this by choosing a rewards card that provides bonus points, miles, or cash back in the areas where you spend the most.

If your spending is all over the place, this may mean opting for a card that offers a flat percentage cash back. Or you may prefer to use a card that provides extra rewards for gas and groceries.

Of course, if you really want to maximize your rewards, consider using different cards for different purchases. You could have your general cash back card, for example, but also another card that gives you 5% rewards on dining out, that you only use when you go to restaurants.

If you follow these five big rules for credit card use, your cards can help you to build credit, and reap generous rewards for your everyday spending. Credit cards will help your finances, rather than hinder your financial progress, and you'll be much better off for having used them.

This may be the perfect cash back card ! That's because it packs in $1,148 of value. Cardholders can earn up to 5% cash back, double rewards in the first year, and avoid interest well into 2020. With such a deep bench of perks you'll wonder how this card packs in a $0 annual fee. Best yet, you can apply and get a decision in two minutes. Learn more with our in-depth review.

2019-09-03 07:21:00,"On one hand, legal marijuana could prove to be one of the fastest-growing industries on the planet over the next decade. If investment bank Stifel's forecast of $200 billion in annual worldwide sales in 10 years proves accurate, we could be looking at a compound annual growth rate for cannabis of around 34%.

On the other hand, marijuana stocks have been a train wreck since the beginning of the second quarter. Supply chain woes in Canada, high tax rates in the U.S., and disappointing operating results have sunk the industry. In August, the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences ETF , the first tradable cannabis ETF, fell nearly 14%, and is now down 34%, inclusive o f dividends paid, since the end of March.

The data gets even uglier for the combined 58 direct cannabis players and ancillary stocks I regularly follow. After July saw just nine pot stocks head higher , August tallied only 10 winners -- five of which rose by less than 4%. Suffice it to say, it was another ugly month for marijuana stocks.

Image source: Getty Images.

Nevertheless, the following 10 pot stocks, listed in descending order by percentage gain, managed to buck industrywide weakness last month.

You'll probably note that a lot of brand-name marijuana stocks are absent from the list of August's gainers. However, a few trends do emerge that may help explain why this particular group of companies outperformed.

Image source: Getty Images.

Continuing a theme from July, ancillary cannabis stocks had a relatively good month, all things considered. The reason? Only a small percentage of their revenue is tied to marijuana, meaning they have other non-cannabis revenue streams to lean on.

Shopify, for example, continues to kick ""bud"" and take names, with the highflier tacking on another 21% in August. Shopify is responsible for providing e-commerce solutions for Ontario's brick-and-mortar, online, and mobile marijuana sales, as well as various private retailers in British Columbia. Despite supply issues persisting throughout much of Canada, Shopify currently generates the bulk of its revenue from merchant solutions and subscription revenue outside of the marijuana industry. Thus, Shopify gets the benefit of being associated with the fast-growing cannabis industry without the pain of being a direct player.

Similarly, Constellation Brands has been riding high (pardon the pun) thanks to its high-end spirits and beer selection. Back in November, Constellation closed on a $4 billion equity investment in Canopy Growth , thereby upping its stake in the company to 37%. Unfortunately, huge quarterly losses at Canopy have led Constellation to book losses tied to its equity stake . Nonetheless, high-margin alcohol sales remain strong, buffering Constellation Brands from recent weakness in the cannabis industry.

Image source: Getty Images.

In case you haven't noticed by now, operating results actually matter -- and companies that can surprise Wall Street with a positive report have been getting a lift.

On Aug. 1, Aphria wound up reporting significantly better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter operating results, which helps explain why it was the top-performing direct pot stock last month. Sequential quarterly revenue soared 75% to nearly 129 million Canadian dollars, with adult-use marijuana sales surging by 158% from the sequential third quarter to CA$18.5 million. Even though most of Aphria's sales surge was tied to its distribution business and not marijuana, the bump up in recreational weed sales was a pleasant surprise at a time when supply issues are rampant in Canada.

Plant biotechnology company 22nd Century Group, August's top-performing pot stock, also benefited from a well-received earnings report . On Aug. 7, 22nd Century Group announced that while second-quarter sales had declined by 15.9% to $5.82 million from the prior-year period, the company's net operating loss shrank by more than $2 million to $5.03 million. There was also a significant decline in equity-based compensation. Though 22nd Century Group is still a highly speculative investment, shareholders liked what they saw in the company's Augus t report .

Image source: Getty Images.

Lastly, while we've witnessed most marijuana acquisition and merger partners falling in tandem over the past couple of months, the duo of Cresco Labs and Origin House managed to buoy each other in August.

There look to be two reasons behind the modest rise in both companies. First, there's the optimism that the U.S. Justice Department's Antitrust Division will approve the combination of Cresco Labs and Origin House . If the deal goes through, Cresco Labs will gain access to more than 500 California dispensaries, giving it the ability to rapidly grow sales. Origin House is one of just a small handful of licensed distributors in the Golden State.

The other factor at work here is an extension of the previous point: operating results. Both companies reported their most recent quarterly operating results in late August, with Cresco delivering $29.9 million in sales , a 253% year-over-year increase, and Origin House generating CA$21.4 million in sales , representing a 511% increase from the prior-year quarter. In terms of sequential quarterly sales growth, Cresco and Origin House clocked in at 42% and 91%, respectively.

Investors are clearly excited about this combination, and it certainly showed with these two pot stocks bucking general industry weakness in August.

Here's The Marijuana Stock You've Been Waiting For A little-known Canadian company just unlocked what some experts think could be the key to profiting off the coming marijuana boom. 

And make no mistake - it is coming.

Cannabis legalization is sweeping over North America - 10 states plus Washington, D.C., have all legalized recreational marijuana over the last few years, and full legalization came to Canada in October 2018.

NEW YORK, Sept 3 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday asinvestors worried about global growth prospects after datashowed U.S. factory activity shrank in August for the first timesince 2016 and the United States and China imposed new tariffson each other over the weekend.

Investors fled riskier assets as the latest round of tariffsand the lack of a date for a resumption of U.S.-China talksgnawed at any hopes for a resolution to the long-running tradewar, which has rattled markets for months and weighed on worldeconomies. urn:newsml:reuters.com:*:nL2N25U0FT

Compounding the uncertainty, the Institute for SupplyManagement said early in the day that its index of nationalfactory activity dropped to 49.1, compared with a reading of51.1 estimated by analysts polled by Reuters.  urn:newsml:reuters.com:*:nL2N25R073

""If anything the U.S. manufacturing data signals that thenew tariffs couldn't come at a worse time. It's bad news on topof bad news. That's why investors are so focused onnegotiations"" said Alec Young, managing director of globalmarkets research at FTSE Russell based in New York.     ""Not only have expectations been receding for a U.S.-Chinadeal but they can't even agree on a date to meet,"" said Young. 

He also cited growing uncertainty around Brexit as a concernfor investors.

SINGAPORE, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Technology startups are luring airlines with demand-forecasting tools powered by artificial intelligence (AI), promising to boost efficiency at a time of rising fuel costs and upheaval in trade relations that has clouded the aviation sector's outlook.

Demand intelligence firm PredictHQ on Tuesday announced product Aviation Rank which alerts airlines to major events, whereas software developer Volantio is touting Yana, a platform that helps carriers rebook customers to maximise revenue.

Artificial intelligence is making in-roads in industries across the spectrum. In aviation, airlines use AI for website chatbots aimed at cutting customer service costs, for more targeted advertising, and to improve aircraft maintenance.

PredictHQ's Aviation Rank can alert airlines to over 3,000 major events a month such as conferences, music festivals and sporting meets, and determine relative importance to demand.

Carriers can then raise fares to take advantage of high demand or focus on filling seats at lower prices when they know there will be slower periods, said PredictHQ's San Francisco-based Chief Executive Campbell Brown.

""Airlines are coming to us rather than sitting in a room and having a guess at what events might be impacting them and putting it into a spreadsheet and trying to kind of anecdotally match that to their forecasting,"" Brown told Reuters in a telephone interview ahead of Aviation Rank's launch.

Annual conferences, for instance, can involve thousands of delegates generating millions of dollars in bookings. However, venues can change each year, making it difficult to forecast demand on certain routes using historical data, PredictHQ said.

""What we do is we provide that in a very automated fashion,"" Brown said.

Initial Aviation Rank customers include a major British airline and two European carriers, PredictHQ said, declining to identify them for commercial reasons. Elsewhere, PredictHQ's other clients include ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies Inc  and online travel agent Booking Holdings Inc .

To better manage disruption and overbooking, Atlanta-based Volantio has signed carriers including Qantas Airways Ltd  and JetBlue Airways Corp  to Yana.

The platform helps airlines re-sell seats at better prices by offering passengers incentives such as travel vouchers, upgrades or frequent flyer points to switch to other flights at times of high demand.

""Upgrades are the most popular offers,"" Volantio CEO Azim Barodawala said in an email. ""Our acceptance has been as high as 40% to 50%.""

The startup is also exploring expanding the product to give airlines the ability to prioritise high-value cargo, presenting passengers with incentives to take another flight to accommodate the cargo's weight, Barodawala said.",Tech startups tout AI to airlines seeking revenue boost - Nasdaq.com,https://www.nasdaq.com/article/tech-startups-tout-ai-to-airlines-seeking-revenue-boost-20190903-00472

Rollovers are one of the most important and hotly contested areas of forthcoming regulation. The mostly defunct DOL rule stated that advisors need to act in the best interest of clients when dealing with rollovers only if the firm was a fiduciary. However, the big forthcoming change is that the SEC Best Interest rule essentially states that advisors AND brokers need to act in the best interest of clients all the time, but allows that disclosure of material conflicts can be sufficient to overcome any hurdles. According to Drinker Biddle & Reath, a leading wealth management law firm, ""Reg BI standard of care obligation requires that a broker-dealer have a reasonable basis to believe that taking the assets out of the plan and rolling them over to an IRA is in the best interest of the participant at the time of the recommendation"".

FINSUM : So the DOL rule was very strict but fairly narrow in application, while the SEC rule is broader (encompassing brokers and fiduciaries) but less strict.

2019-09-03 06:52:00," Wall Street saw a wild August with the S&P 500 posting 11 moves of more than 1% in 22 trading sessions of the month. Those moves included three declines of at least 2.6% as well as the index's worst day of the year on Aug 5, per CNBC  . The large swings were mainly triggered by escalation in trade tensions and a recession warning by the bond market. Additionally, weak global economic data, low inflation and political unrest in Hong Kong added to the chaos.  makeArticleAd();  Below we discuss some of the events that dominated the headlines in August and will be worth watching this month:   Trade Drama    Trade continued to play foul in the stock market as both the United States and China put in place their latest tariff increases on each other's goods effective Sep 1. The Trump administration raised tariffs from 10% to 15% on $112 billion worth of Chinese goods including footwear, apparel and Apple AAPL  Watches, while China imposed retaliatory tariffs hike on some of American goods, including pork, beef, chicken and agricultural goods, on its $75 billion target list.    Trump plans to levy duties on further $160 billion in Chinese products such as laptops and cellphones in mid-December. China plans to ramp up tariffs on soybeans to 30% from 25% in mid-December.    Though the trade representatives from the world's two biggest economies are expected to resume talks this month, tariff hike will hurt U.S. consumers, pushing up the prices of goods and thereby curtailing spending. It will further impact worldwide economy and corporate profits, particularly at big U.S. exporters. As such, investors are rushing to a flight to safety in gold, which often acts as safe haven, benefiting gold-mining companies.    Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited HMY  , with a Zacks Rank #2 and VGM Score of A, emerged as the winner in August, gaining about 41%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal year (ending June 2020) has moved up from 41 cents to 47 cents over the past three months. The company has an estimated earnings growth rate of 235.71%.   Fed Action    The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 bps to 2-2.5% in its latest policy meeting ended Jul 31 for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis. It also said that the move is a ""midcycle adjustment"" and not the start of a lengthy series of rate cuts. However, additional cuts seem to be in the cards this month given the rising trade spat, recessionary fears and bouts of downbeat economic data that is cooling global economic growth.    If the Fed cuts rate further, high-dividend-yield sectors such as utilities and real estate continued to be the winners given their sensitivity to interest rates. Some of the top-ranked stocks from these spaces include NRG Energy Inc. NRG  , ONEOK Inc. OKE  , City Office REIT Inc. CIO   and Ryman Hospitality Properties Inc. RHP  . These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), suggesting their outperformance in the months ahead. Further, these stocks are expected to generate solid earnings growth this year (NRG - 67.6%, OKE - 11.5%, CIO - 14% and RHP - 15.9%). You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here   .   Weak Trading    August was the second-losing month of 2019 for Wall Street with the S&P 500 shedding 1.8%, the Dow Jones dropping 1.7% and the Nasdaq losing 2.6%. The Russell 2000 Index took the heaviest losses for the month, falling 5.1%. The brutal trading seen is August is expected to continue in September.    This is because September is historically the worst month for the stock market. According to Dow Jones Market Data, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 since 1937 saw average declines of 1% each. The Nasdaq Composite, which was introduced in 1971, also dropped 0.5% on average. The declines are due to a seasonal phenomenon as investors are more prone to selling than buying when they return from their summer vacations, trading volume after Labor Day is mostly bearish, many mutual funds have fiscal years ending Sep 30, window-dressing is rampant, and investors generally sell stocks to pay tuition bills for their kids' private schools and colleges.    Against such a backdrop, investors should consider low-beta stocks, which exhibit greater levels of stability and usually lose less when the market is crumbling. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd RDY  , with a market cap of $5.94 and a beta of 0.21, could be a solid pick. The stock has an estimated growth rate of 25.6% for this fiscal year (ending March 2020).

Sept 3 (Reuters) - The singing superstar Ariana Grande has sued Forever 21 for $10 million, accusing the fashion retailer and a beauty company started by its billionaire founders' daughters of piggybacking off her fame and influence to sell their wares.

In a complaint filed on Monday, Grande said Forever 21 and Riley Rose misappropriated her name, image, likeness and music, including by employing a ""strikingly similar"" looking model,in a website and social media campaign early this year.

Grande has more than 65 million Twitter followers and 163 million Instagram followers. A core part of the 26-year-old's fanbase overlaps Forever 21's and Riley Rose's target markets.

Forever 21 and Riley Rose did not immediately respond on Tuesday to emailed requests for comment.

Founded in 1984, Forever 21 said it recently had 815 stores in 57 countries.

Its founders, Do Won and Jin Sook Chang, are worth $1.5 billion according to Forbes magazine. Their daughters, Linda and Esther Chang, opened the first Riley Rose boutique in 2017.

According to Grande's complaint, Forever 21 and Riley Rose misappropriated at least 30 images and videos, including by using audio and lyrics from her recent No. 1 single ""7 Rings,"" and by using the look-alike model.

""The resemblance is uncanny,"" the complaint said.

Grande's lawsuit in Los Angeles federal court seeks damages for copyright and trademark infringement, false endorsement, and violating her right of publicity.

2019-09-03 12:20:00,"Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ: ULTA) recently shocked investors by reducing its full-year growth expectations. The spa and beauty products retailer said it sees sluggish sales and falling profitability for a second straight year, rather than the modest rebound it had predicted just a few months ago.

In a conference call with analysts, CEO Mary Dillon and her team explained the reasoning behind the downgrade while noting that their positive long-term outlook hasn't changed. Below are a few highlights from that presentation.

Image source: Getty Images.

The Ulta Beauty team delivered another quarter of solid top line performance, gross margin expansion and double-digi t earnings growth.
 -- Dillon

The fiscal second quarter wasn't bad. In fact, revenue rose at about the same pace as in previous quarters, with rising customer traffic supporting a 6% increase in comparable-store sales . The expanding store base allowed overall sales to rise 12% compared to 13% last quarter. Profitability was also healthy, with gross profit margin ticking up to 36.4% of sales from 36% a year ago.

Yet executives noted a worsening of demand in the core cosmetics segment that makes up about half of its business and delivers its highest-margin sales. That niche didn't stabilize, as management had predicted it would, but instead fell further into negative territory. ""After several years of very strong performance,"" Dillon said, ""growth in the makeup category has been decelerating over the last two years and recently turned negative.""

The most recent cycle of innovation has just not driven [new makeup] behaviors, resulting in a soft cycle for the cosmetics category as innovation and newness brought to the market has not driven the expected growth.
 -- Dillon

Management noted that Ulta is winning market share across its product niches, including in the core makeup category. However, the latest products released by major makeup brands aren't resonating with customers as strongly as they have in recent years. New launches aren't sparking additional application rituals and techniques, so the overall industry has started declining. Ulta is optimistic that a rebound will eventually occur in this consumer staple niche, but likely not in 2019.

It has become apparent to us that we will not see the improvement we had expected in prestige makeup and we will likely also see moderation in the mass makeup sales trend. As a result, we have lowered our sales and gross margin expectations for the second half of the year.
 -- CFO Scott Settersten

Ulta's original 2019 growth outlook assumed rebounding demand in the makeup category during the second half of the year. That boost isn't looking likely, given the current trends, so executives rolled back their guidance. Specifically, the company now sees comps rising by between 4% and 6% for the year rather than the 6% to 7% prior range. Operating margin is now on track to decline for the second straight year rather than rebound slightly.

Part of that earnings shortfall is due to the demand challenges, but the rest is driven by continued aggressive investments in things like store remodels and the build-out of Ulta's e-commerce abilities. Executives see no reason to scale back on these long-term investments during what they believe is just a temporary growth issue for the wider makeup industry.

Sept 3 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Tuesday rejected efforts by drugmakers, distributors and pharmacies to dismiss claims that they caused the nation's opioid crisis, clearing the way for a scheduled  landmark trial even as he pushes for a nationwide settlement.

U.S. District Judge Dan Polster, who oversees roughly 2,000 opioid lawsuits by state and local governments, said the plaintiffs could try to prove that drugmakers' deceptive marketing of the painkillers caused a harmful, massive increase in supply that distributors and pharmacies did not do enough to stop.

The ruling was among seven decisions and orders totaling 80 pages issued by Polster ahead of a scheduled Oct. 21 trial by two Ohio counties against Purdue Pharma, the OxyContin maker accused of fueling the epidemic, and several other defendants.

Polster also refused to dismiss civil conspiracy claims against the drugmakers, distributors and pharmacies, and said federal law did not preempt a variety of the plaintiffs' claims.

Opioid addiction claimed roughly 400,000 lives in the United States from 1999 to 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Critics of the industry said opioid makers hid the addiction and abuse risks of prolonged use from consumers.

Defendants in the litigation also include the drugmaker Endo International Plc ; pharmacy operators CVS Health Corp , Rite Aid Corp , Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc  and Walmart Inc ; and major distributors AmerisourceBergen Corp , Cardinal Health Inc  and McKesson Corp , among others.

Polster also rejected separate dismissal requests by the generic drugmakers Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd  and Allergan Plc .

Lawyers for the respective defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment or declined to comment.

Paul Hanly, a lawyer for the counties, said the plaintiffs were pleased that Polster ""almost uniformly"" agreed with their positions on the dismissal motions and whether various testimony should be admitted.

Purdue Pharma and its owners, the Sackler family, have been in talks on a possible $10 billion to $12 billion nationwide settlement of opioid claims, two people familiar with the matter said last week. 

That accord could include a bankruptcy filing for the Stamford, Connecticut-based company. Purdue and the Sacklers have denied the allegations.

BUENOS AIRES, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Argentina's peso surged on Tuesday, pumped up by Wall Street traders cheering President Mauricio Macri's capital controls that are aimed at protecting the beleaguered currency.

The peso closed 5.39% higher at 55.98 per U.S. dollar, traders said, its strongest level in a week after a near record low close on Friday. Country risk, which soared to its highest level in more than a decade last month, also fell.

The currency rebound gives some relief to Macri, after a shock primary election battering last month sparked a sharp crash in the country's bonds, equities and the peso, which lost around 26% of its value against the greenback in August alone.

Argentina's S&P Merval stock index , however, took a hit in afternoon trading, closing down 11.9% at a two-year low in a slide that local analysts attributed to global trade jitters.

""All the markets are in the red and a weakened country like Argentina, with a complicated political situation, gets hits even more,"" said Hector Scasserra, director of local brokerage firm Arpenta Sociedad de Bolsa.

In Europe, the pounding of Argentina's bonds also eased after they had fallen to record lows on Monday, while there were tentative gains in some foreign-traded bank shares.

Ratings agency Fitch upgraded Argentina's long-term issuer debt rating to ""CC"" or just barely above default from ""restricted default"" saying the new rating reflects their view that ""a further default or debt restructuring of some kind is probable."" 

Frankfurt-listed American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) of Grupo Financiero Galicia  were up 0.6% after having tumbled 7.7.% on Monday while Banco Macro SA's  ADRs fell over 6% in New York, where markets were closed on Monday for a holiday.

MarketAxess data showed Argentina's century bond  traded marginally higher while the January 2028 bond  dipped under 37 cents on the dollar.

The black market peso, available via unofficial traders, also rose on Tuesday, although not as sharply as the official spot rate. Following a fall on Monday, it has now diverged from the official rate by the largest margin since 2015, a sign of tension over pricing of the currency. 

STILL AN EMERGING MARKET

Index provider MSCI said it was closely monitoring developments in Argentina but that the country's ""emerging market"" status for the purpose of MSCI indexes remained valid for now as MSCI Argentina only held foreign-listed shares.

Argentina was included in the emerging markets index in May, potentially boosting inflows to the eight stocks that were added. 

Any reclassification of Argentina in the widely followed indexes would first require a public consultation from MSCI.

On Sunday, the government authorized the central bank to restrict purchases of dollars as it burns through its reserves to prop up the peso. The currency controls were a 180-degree turn for Macri, a free-markets advocate who abolished capital controls after he came to power in 2015. 

It was the government's latest attempt to stabilize the peso, which has lost around 20% of its value since opposition presidential candidate Alberto Fernandez emerged as the clear front-runner in the Aug. 11 primary election.

On Tuesday, the government also said in a decree published in the country's official gazette that it would unilaterally hike the minimum wage by 35% over the next few months. Argentina's 12-month inflation is running at close to 55%.

Fernandez and his running mate, former President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, are considered a riskier prospect by investors, who fear Argentina could return to the interventionist policies of her former government.

On Monday, central bank president Guido Sandleris called Argentina's financial system ""strong"" and said the bank would adhere to its strict monetary policy, despite the currency restrictions. 

Sandleris, speaking at a news conference, said the bank was in talks with the International Monetary Fund to ""redefine"" the monetary goals for September under its $57 billion financing agreement.",Argentina's peso jumps on second day of capital controls - Nasdaq.com,https://www.nasdaq.com/article/argentinas-peso-jumps-on-second-day-of-capital-controls-20190903-00766
2019-09-03 11:03:00,"Investors in CBRE Group Inc (Symbol: CBRE) saw new options become available today, for the June 2020 expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 290 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CBRE options chain for the new June 2020 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.

Because the $50.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 61%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.80% return on the cash commitment, or 9.82% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost .

Considering the fact that the $55.00 strike represents an approximate 7% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 54%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.64% boost of extra return to the investor, or 7.10% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost .

After a solid earnings announcement for the second quarter announced July 29, Nokia (NYSE: NOK ) shares enjoyed a brief rally, trading up to around $5.69. But since then, enthusiasm has leveled off, with NOK stock trading sideways for some weeks at around the $5.10 to $5.18 level before falling off even further.

The August doldrums have wound down. Much of the fear of a trade war with China is priced into markets. For investors looking for a sleeping giant in telecoms, Nokia may be just the bet.

Here are three key reasons why Nokia may outperform in the next telecom sector rally:

The upcoming next-gen standard for mobile telecommunications service , 5G, will deliver significantly faster speed than today's 4G technology. 5G will allow users to browse data-intensive websites, such as Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) YouTube, upload or download videos and use data-intensive apps. 5G can also deliver virtual reality much more quickly than the current 4G system.

In the U.S., Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) and AT&T (NYSE: T ) will likely be the first to offer 5G speeds. In fact, Verizon is already claiming that its 5G technology will probably deliver speeds 200 times faster than many of its 4G LTE users get now. Globally, Vodafone (NASDAQ: VOD ) will likely be the market leader in Europe.

The market for 5G will likely not take off until 2020. But when it does, users across the globe will need a brand new 5G standard smartphone. Carriers will sink billions into new 5G equipment. And Nokia will be positioned front and center in offering the new hardware across the globe.

According to Chief Executive Officer Rajeev Suri speaking to Bloomberg , ""Nokia is winning contracts quite handsomely in new 5G telecom networks as the top three suppliers go head-to-head for the emerging business."" He added, ""We compete quite favorably with Huawei , with or without the current security concerns,"" Suri said referring to Huawei Technologies , the world's largest network equipment manufacturer.

The market is now keenly focused on how far Nokia will pounce on 5G once the new standard introduced onto the global market. ""Only Huawei and Nokia have full end-to-end product portfolios with wireless, fixed networks, and IP routing solutions, positioning Nokia for leadership with the top carriers as networks transition to 5G,"" according to Michael Walkley, telecom analyst at Canaccord Research . ""[W]ith Huawei still potentially banned from certain markets, we view Nokia as the only global supplier with an end-to-end solution, as evidenced by leading global carriers choosing Nokia as a partner for 5G"".

The history of technology paradigm shifts is filled with examples of companies throwing billions in capital down a black hole - only to face far more competition in the market and far less revenues than expected. NOK is undoubtedly spending heavily on building their 5G market lead - but with a certain degree of prudence.

In the last earnings call, Nokia's CFO, Kristian Pullola, explained that they expect their most recent cost-savings program to result in a nearly $800 million reduction in recurring operating expenses and production overheads in 2020. So while NOK will make the massive capital investment necessary to win in the new 5G market, they are certainly keenly aware of past spending black holes - and are already implementing tight financial controls.

NOK has managed to meet or beat analysts' estimates in for of the last five quarters. For their latest earnings call in July, NOK sounded more confident than ever that they will grow their critical metrics across the board for 2020. Full-year revenues are estimated to move into the positive territory up to 40 cents to 46 cents EPS. NOK also expects operating margin increasing from the 9-15% estimated this year up to 12 to 16% in 2020.

""Our expectation is that we will outperform our primary market in full-year 2019 and over the longer term, driven by our strategy, which includes competing in 5G more effectively due to our strong end to end portfolio, focusing on targeted growth opportunities in attractive adjacent markets and building a strong network agnostic software business,"" said Rajeev Suri, Nokia's president and CEO.

Most telecom and tech stocks have had a rough ride over the summer, and are now tending to trade sideways. When the investing season starts to heat up in September, the sideways trend for NOK stock could turn decidedly bullish - and even more so after their third-quarter earnings call in October.

As of this writing, Theodore Kim did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

NEW YORK, Sept 3 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday after the United States and China imposed new tariffs on each other and data showed U.S. factory activity shrank in August for the first time since 2016, renewing growth fears.

Investors fled riskier assets as the latest face-off gnawed at any hopes for a resolution to the long-running U.S.-China trade war, which has rattled markets for months and weighed on world economies. 

The uncertain outlook also pushed the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield  to its lowest level since July 2016 as bonds were in demand.

""Sentiment was already poor to start the day and then the weaker-than-expected manufacturing data just added fuel to the fire,"" said Dave Mazza, managing director and head of product at asset management firm Direxion in New York.

""We now have confirmation that the escalation in the trade war has spilled over to U.S. manufacturing just as it has to manufacturing around the globe,"" he added.

At 2:55PM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 336.92 points, or 1.28%, to 26,066.36, the S&P 500  lost 26.73 points, or 0.91%, to 2,899.73 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 105.76 points, or 1.33%, to 7,857.13.

Earlier in the day data showed British construction companies last month suffered the sharpest drop in new orders since the financial crisis due to jitters about Brexit. 

""It's not just tariffs. Tariffs are the main thing but there are other areas of unknown which tend to be a bad thing for stocks. People like certainty,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago.    

 Trade-sensitive industrials  fell 1.8%, the biggest percentage loser among the S&P 11 major sectors. Technology stocks  fell 1.5%, weighed down by chipmakers, which have large revenue exposure to China. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index  dropped 2.2%.

Boeing Co shares , tumbled 3%, weighing on the Dow, after the Federal Aviation Administration said on Friday a global panel of experts will need a few more weeks to finish its review of the company's 737 MAX certification. 

U.S. casino operators felt the brunt of slowing economic growth in China as gambling hub Macau posted weak August casino revenue. Shares of Las Vegas Sands Corp , Wynn Resorts Ltd  and MGM Resorts International  fell between 2% and almost 5%. 

Among the few gainers were the defensive utilities , real estate  and consumer staples  sectors.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.90-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.74-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The Uinta Basin asset, expected to produce about 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in 2020, was sold to a private operator for about C$700 million in cash, the company said without naming the buyer. 

The oil and gas producer said it would also look to sell more assets, including the remaining portion of its southeast Saskatchewan conventional assets.

Crescent expects the deal to help reduce its net debt to about C$2.75 billion at the end of 2019 from C$4.40 billion in 2018.

The Calgary, Alberta-based company said it expects the deal to add about 11% to its debt-adjusted funds flow per share.

Sept 3 (Reuters) - India's economy will rely on further monetary easing to kick-start sagging growth as budgetary constraints rule out significant fiscal stimulus, Shumita Deveshwar, Director of India Research at TS Lombard, said on Tuesday.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cut the key repo rate  to a more than nine-year low of 5.40% at its last meeting, and markets are pricing in further cuts this year as growth in Asia's third largest economy slows.

Data on Friday showed economic growth slowing to a more than 6-year low of 5% year-on-year in the April-June quarter , heightening speculation of an extra burst of fiscal stimulus from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's newly re-elected administration. 

The following are excerpts from the Reuters Global Markets Forum chat. To join the forum, click here:

Question: Considering the recent growth data, how many more basis points of cuts do you expect this year from the RBI?

Answer: I think we could see up to 50 basis points more. The RBI has been easing very aggressively, and considering the negative surprise of lower-than-expected growth in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 and dim prospects of a strong recovery anytime soon, the RBI will continue to ease.

Q: What form do you think a possible fiscal stimulus package could take? How much of an impact could it have on the fiscal deficit?

A: Despite slowing growth, the government has done little by way of any additional fiscal stimulus than what was already previously announced. So it seems it has limited room to maneuver as far as fiscal space is concerned amid worries expressed by some in the RBI that the public sector borrowing requirement is already quite large at around 8-9% of the GDP.

Even the large transfer of the RBI's reserves is going to be used for bank recapitalization and for meeting the shortfall in the budgeted tax revenue. 

So there is hardly any direct fiscal stimulus that seems to be forthcoming... It will need a very large fiscal stimulus to come out of the current slowdown, and the government clearly does not seem to have the space to do so, and is, therefore, doing very little fiscally.

Q: So, do you see possible stimulus in or after mid-2020 if the economic growth continues to be tepid?

A: I think the government is heavily leaning on the RBI for jumpstarting the economy, and we have seen the RBI comply in terms of aggressive monetary easing, the large transfer of reserves and easier norms for the banking sector. 

Any fiscal stimulus will be limited because there simply isn't the space for the government to do so, unless it wants to blow its targets completely. That is a risk we cannot fully discount, but for now it seems monetary policy is where the onus is.

Q: Has the large transfer by the RBI to the government altered international investors' view of the central bank?

A: In my view, the big worry as far as the RBI's transfer of its capital reserves is concerned is the precedent that it sets for the future. For one, the transfer is now not on the RBI's discretion, but it is based on a formula. 

This time around, the maximum possible amount was drawn from the RBI as permitted by that formula. The RBI board decided on the lower end of the contingency risk buffer. What then will prevent future governments from demanding the maximum possible transfer from the RBI - that is the question.

This interview was conducted in the Reuters Global Markets Forum, a chatroom hosted on the Refinitiv Eikon Messenger platform.","Q&A-India will use monetary, not fiscal, easing to revive growth - TS Lombard - Nasdaq.com",https://www.nasdaq.com/article/qaindia-will-use-monetary-not-fiscal-easing-to-revive-growth--ts-lombard-20190903-00865

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: AGCO Corp. AGCO  , Alphabet Inc. GOOGL  , KLA Corp. KLAC  and Microsoft Corp. MSFT  .  Here are highlights from Friday's Analyst Blog:    4 Best Stocks to Buy as Trade Tensions Abate   U.S. stocks posted strong gains in the last couple of trading sessions, mostly because China indicated that it won't react to the recent U.S. tariffs immediately. Ministry of Commerce spokesman Gao Feng confirmed that it is time to discuss measures to remove tariffs to prevent an escalation in the trade war. Lest we forget, troubles began after China announced plans of imposing new tariffs of 5% to 10% on nearly $75 billion of U.S. products. Beijing clarified that the move in reaction to the Trump administration's intention to impose 10% tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese imports. Trump, in the meantime, acted in response to China's decision by saying that the United States will increase tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods to 30% from an earlier 25%. And tariffs on additional $300 billion imports from China would go up to 15% from 10%. Nonetheless, a possible indication of a truce between two of the world's largest economies has alleviated risks in the equity market for now. A full-blown trade war would have had rippling effects on the global economy growth, casting a pall over businesses. Let us now look at stocks that have benefitted from the easing trade tensions:  Potential Winners as China Tamps Down Trade War   Escalation  As mentioned earlier, progress in trade talks has helped the Dow components, especially Boeing. After all, the aerospace giant sells about a fourth of its commercial aircraft to Chinese customers. And how can we forget that China had threatened to impose tariffs on several American products, including airplanes if there is no trade truce. Such a move could easily affect Boeing's 737-800, 737-700 and 737-900 ER models. But, with tariff scares behind us for now, Boeing has ample reasons to rejoice. Within the Dow, Intel in particular is expected to gain immensely. This is because Intel more or less generates bulk of its revenues from China, and it's more than what the semiconductor company makes in the United States. China, in fact, relies heavily on U.S. chipmakers, while semiconductors make up one of its largest import categories in terms of value. Hopes of abatement in U.S.-China trade tensions provided strength to the chip sector. To top it, China's latest plan to spur economic growth will surely boost semiconductor stocks, especially those in the region, in the near term as well. China is expecting to roll out a plan to improve disposable income this year. The broader tech sector has also a lot to gain from reduced trade war fears. The components of the SPDR Technology Select Sector had seen significant amount of revenues coming from China in recent years. In fact, China is in the second place in terms of revenue generation, behind the United States.  4 Top Picks  As trade war worries dissipate and broader markets move north, investing in stocks from the aforesaid sectors which are making the most of the recovery seems judicious.

2019-09-03 13:21:00,"WASHINGTON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Illinois has joined a multistate lawsuit aimed at stopping the merger of U.S. wireless carriers T-Mobile US Inc  and Sprint Corp , the New York attorney general's office, which is leading the effort along with California, said on Tuesday.

Illinois joins 15 other states and the District of Columbia in seeking to stop the $26 billion merger, which the states argue will lead to higher costs for consumers.

A spokeswoman for T-Mobile said the company had no comment.

Last month, a U.S. District Court in Manhattan ordered that the trial be delayed to Dec. 9, a victory for the states which had said they needed more time to investigate the deal.

""With fewer companies competing, customers would face fewer choices, higher prices, less innovation and lower quality service,"" Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul said in a statement.

The Justice Department has signed off on the merger while the Federal Communications Commission has indicated it plans to approve it, and has begun the process of formally doing so.

To win those approvals, the third- and fourth-largest U.S. wireless companies agreed to divest Sprint's prepaid businesses to satellite television company Dish Network Corp  to create a fourth U.S. wireless carrier.","Illinois joins lawsuit to stop T-Mobile, Sprint merger - Nasdaq.com",https://www.nasdaq.com/article/illinois-joins-lawsuit-to-stop-tmobile-sprint-merger-20190903-00963
2019-09-03 11:40:42,"Investors in First Solar Inc (Symbol: FSLR) saw new options begin trading today, for the October 11th expiration. At Stock Options Channel  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the FSLR options chain for the new October 11th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.    The put contract at the $60.50 strike price has a current bid of $2.42. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $60.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $58.08 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of FSLR, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $61.41/share today. Because the $60.50 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 58%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.00% return on the cash commitment, or 38.42% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost  .  makeArticleAd();  Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for First Solar Inc, and highlighting in green where the $60.50 strike is located relative to that history:       Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $62.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.67. If an investor was to purchase shares of FSLR stock at the current price level of $61.41/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $62.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.31% if the stock gets called away at the October 11th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if FSLR shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for First Solar Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing FSLR's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $62.00 strike highlighted in red:    Considering the fact that the $62.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 50%.

BUENOS AIRES, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Argentina's peso surged on Tuesday, pumped up by Wall Street traders cheering President Mauricio Macri's capital controls that are aimed at protecting the beleaguered currency.

The peso closed 5.39% higher at 55.98 per U.S. dollar, traders said, its strongest level in a week after a near record low close on Friday. Country risk, which soared to its highest level in more than a decade last month, also fell.

The currency rebound gives some relief to Macri, after a shock primary election battering last month sparked a sharp crash in the country's bonds, equities and the peso, which lost around 26% of its value against the greenback in August alone.

Argentina's S&P Merval stock index , however, took a hit in afternoon trading, closing down 11.9% at a two-year low in a slide that local analysts attributed to global trade jitters.

""All the markets are in the red and a weakened country like Argentina, with a complicated political situation, gets hits even more,"" said Hector Scasserra, director of local brokerage firm Arpenta Sociedad de Bolsa.

In Europe, the pounding of Argentina's bonds also eased after they had fallen to record lows on Monday, while there were tentative gains in some foreign-traded bank shares.

Ratings agency Fitch upgraded Argentina's long-term issuer debt rating to ""CC"" or just barely above default from ""restricted default"" saying the new rating reflects their view that ""a further default or debt restructuring of some kind is probable."" 

Frankfurt-listed American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) of Grupo Financiero Galicia  were up 0.6% after having tumbled 7.7.% on Monday while Banco Macro SA's  ADRs fell over 6% in New York, where markets were closed on Monday for a holiday.

MarketAxess data showed Argentina's century bond  traded marginally higher while the January 2028 bond  dipped under 37 cents on the dollar.

The black market peso, available via unofficial traders, also rose on Tuesday, although not as sharply as the official spot rate. Following a fall on Monday, it has now diverged from the official rate by the largest margin since 2015, a sign of tension over pricing of the currency. 

STILL AN EMERGING MARKET

Index provider MSCI said it was closely monitoring developments in Argentina but that the country's ""emerging market"" status for the purpose of MSCI indexes remained valid for now as MSCI Argentina only held foreign-listed shares.

Argentina was included in the emerging markets index in May, potentially boosting inflows to the eight stocks that were added. 

Any reclassification of Argentina in the widely followed indexes would first require a public consultation from MSCI.

On Sunday, the government authorized the central bank to restrict purchases of dollars as it burns through its reserves to prop up the peso. The currency controls were a 180-degree turn for Macri, a free-markets advocate who abolished capital controls after he came to power in 2015. 

It was the government's latest attempt to stabilize the peso, which has lost around 20% of its value since opposition presidential candidate Alberto Fernandez emerged as the clear front-runner in the Aug. 11 primary election.

On Tuesday, the government also said in a decree published in the country's official gazette that it would unilaterally hike the minimum wage by 35% over the next few months. Argentina's 12-month inflation is running at close to 55%.

Fernandez and his running mate, former President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, are considered a riskier prospect by investors, who fear Argentina could return to the interventionist policies of her former government.

On Monday, central bank president Guido Sandleris called Argentina's financial system ""strong"" and said the bank would adhere to its strict monetary policy, despite the currency restrictions. 

Sandleris, speaking at a news conference, said the bank was in talks with the International Monetary Fund to ""redefine"" the monetary goals for September under its $57 billion financing agreement.",Wall Street traders pump up Argentine peso as currency controls bite - Nasdaq.com,https://www.nasdaq.com/article/wall-street-traders-pump-up-argentine-peso-as-currency-controls-bite-20190903-00871
2019-09-03 13:30:00,"TUNIS, Sept 3 (Reuters) - A Tunisian appeals court on Tuesday upheld the detention of media magnate Nabil Karoui, a candidate in this month's presidential election, on suspicion of tax fraud and money laundering, his lawyer said.

Karoui, who denies any wrongdoing, had sought to be freed, but the court rejected the demand to release him, lawyer Kamel Ben Massoud told Reuters without giving details or further comment.

Karoui, the owner of Nesma TV channel, is one of the most prominent candidates in the Sept. 15  election along with current and past prime ministers, a former president, the defence minister and the representative of a major Islamist party. 

Karoui founded a charity to combat poverty in 2017 and then set up a political party, leading his critics to accuse him of using his foundation to advance his political ambitions, which he denies. 

In June, parliament passed an amendment to the electoral law forbidding candidates who benefited from ""charitable associations"" or foreign funding in the year before an election, which would have banned him from the race.

However, the late president Beji Caid Essebsi died in July without having signed the law, meaning Karoui was free to enter the election.  

His political party has called his detention a politically motivated attempt to bar him from the race, though government officials have said it is a purely judicial matter. 

Tunisia's electoral commission kept him on the list of eligible candidates after his arrest last month on a court order. 

The president is responsible for foreign and defence policy in Tunisia, while most decision-making powers rest with a prime minister who is chosen by parliament. A parliamentary election will also take place on Oct. 6. 

Despite Karoui still being in detention, his party launched his presidential campaign with a rally on Monday night. On Tuesday, supporters gathered outside the court to demand he be freed.

2019-09-03 09:07:54,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Shares of Best Buy (NYSE: BBY ) plummeted in late August after the consumer electronics retailer pointed to signs of slowing top-line momentum in its second-quarter earnings report. It's probably not a reason to dump Best Buy stock, though.

Best Buy missed revenue and comparable sales estimates in Q2. Management also delivered a below-consensus revenue and comp guide for Q3, while cutting its full-year revenue and comp guide to below-consensus marks. The rationale? A lot of uncertainty surrounding the trade war and its impact on consumption trends in the back-half of 2019. Investors freaked out. Best Buy stock dropped 10%.

This pain is temporary. Zooming out, the big picture fundamentals supporting Best Buy remain favorable. The valuation is dirt cheap. And, the trade war headwinds which are complicating results today, will cool off over the next few months and quarters.

As such, the recent big plunge in Best Buy stock price is a one-off issue. This weakness will pass. When it does, it will be replaced secular strength.

The heart of the recent sell-off in BBY stock is the trade war.

Long story short, the trade war is having an adverse impact of global economic expansion. That is resulting in slowing consumption trends. Those slowing consumption trends are causing Best Buy to put up weaker-than-expected comparable sales numbers, both domestically and internationally.

Management doesn't have much clarity as to when all this trade war noise will end. Thus, they are guiding for comps to remain relatively depressed into the end of the year.

One way of looking at this is that so long as trade war volatility sticks around, Best Buy will struggle to impress with its top-line results, and BBY stock will remain weak. But, the other way of looking at this is that if the trade war cools down, Best Buy will get back to firing off impressive comps, and BBY stock will rebound in a big way.

At the current moment, I think the latter is far more likely.

China is playing the long game with trade. U.S. President Donald Trump isn't the type of guy to surrender. Thus, there won't be any trade war resolution anytime soon. But, China is also very keen on keeping its economic expansion alive and well, and U.S.-China trade accounts for a sizable 5% of China's GDP - so China doesn't want things to get too ugly on the trade war front.

Meanwhile, Trump is going into an election year, so it's in his best interest to keep trade tensions subdued (and the U.S. economic expansion alive) for the time being.

Consequently, it seems likely that while the trade war isn't going away anytime soon, trade tensions between the U.S. and China should materially cool over the next few weeks. As they do cool, consumer confidence globally will regain momentum, and Best Buy's top-line numbers will rebound - as will BBY stock.

Zooming out, the big picture fundamentals underlying Best Buy stock remain favorable and point to a healthy upside over the next few quarters and years.

Best Buy just reported its tenth consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales growth. That is two and a half years of positive comps. During those two and a half years, Best Buy has developed into an omnichannel giant in the consumer electronics space.

That is, not only has Best Buy built out a robust ecommerce business, but the company has also leveraged its huge physical real estate footprint to offer things which online-only players have a really tough time offering - like product Q&A, professional installation services, big-ticket appliance and home theater sales, etc.

As Best Buy has leaned into these alternative offerings, the company has increasingly differentiated itself in the eye of the consumer. The numbers speak for themselves. Again, ten straight quarters of positive comps. On top of that, sales, margins, and profits have all moved higher over the past few years, too.

This growth trend will persist. The consumer electronics space is a secular growth one, since the world is becoming more and more digital every day, and consumers are dedicating more and more of their wallet share to buying these consumer electronics products. Best Buy is a distinguished and leading player in that space with attractive and defensible attributes.

Net net, Best Buy projects as a steady revenue and profit grower over the next few years. At just 11-times forward earnings, Best Buy does not seem priced for that growth. This disconnect ultimately implies that the long term upside potential in Best Buy from current levels is compelling.

I say buy the dip. Near term pain will stick around for a little while longer, but not much longer. Trade war tensions should cool over the next few months.

That cooling should recharge the global consumer heading into the holiday season. That recharging should flow into big holiday numbers for Best Buy, the likes of which should spark a healthy recovery rally in Best Buy stock from today's dirt-cheap levels.

As of this writing, Luke Lango was long BBY.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: J&J JNJ  , Eli Lilly LLY  , Bristol-Myers BMY  , Roche RHHBY  and AbbVie ABBV  .  Here are highlights from Friday's Analyst Blog:    Pharma Stock Roundup: JNJ, LLY, BMY & More   This week, J&J received an unfavorable ruling in the litigation related to abuse of its opioid-based drugs. The FDA granted approval to Lilly's psoriasis injection for active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) while the European Commission approved Bristol-Myers' multiple myeloma drug, Empliciti and Roche's PD-L1 inhibitor, Tecentriq in combination use for an expanded patient population.   Recap of the Week's Most Important Stories     Oklahoma Judge Rules Against J&J in Opioid Lawsuit:   J&J was ordered by a district court in Oklahoma  to pay $572 million to the state of Oklahoma in connection with a lawsuit filed by the latter. The lawsuit claimed that J&J was one of the several companies whose opioid-based drugs - Duragesic, Nucynta and Nucynta ER - were responsible for fueling the state's opioid epidemic. However, the fine was much lower than Oklahoma state's demand of $17 billion to be paid over 30 years by J&J. The company has decided to appeal against the ruling. The company is confident that its drugs were not responsible for the opioid crisis in the state and the ruling is inconsistent with the available facts and law. There are still a number of opioid-related lawsuits pending with about 1900 suits consolidated at the federal level in the state of Ohio, with trial set to begin in October this year.   FDA Approves Lilly's Taltz for Ankylosing Spondylitis:   Lilly gained FDA approval for its psoriasis injection Taltz  for its third indication - active ankylosing spondylitis (AS). A type of spondyloarthritis, AS affects the pelvic joints and spine that can cause severe back pain. The approval was based on data from two phase III studies, COAST-V and COAST-W. Taltz is presently marketed for treating moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and active psoriatic arthritis. Lilly's Olumiant  (baricitinib) met the primary endpoint in a phase III BREEZE-AD7 study, evaluating it in a new indication - moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD), a type of eczema. Lilly is conducting five studies on baricitinib under the AD program and BREEZE-AD7 is the third study to be completed this year. BREEZE-AD1 and BREEZE-AD2 were the other two studies wherein baricitinib 4 mg and 2 mg both met the primary endpoint. Top-line data from the remaining two studies are expected to be presented later this year or early next year.   EU Approval for Expanded Label of Bristol-Myers & Roche's   Cancer Medicines:   The European Commission granted approval for label expansion of Bristol-Myers's multiple myeloma drug, Empliciti  . The drug is now approved in the EU for use in combination with Celgene's Pomalyst (pomalidomide) and low-dose dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (r/rMM) in second- or later-line settings. Empliciti was approved for this combination use in the United States in November last year The regulatory agency also gave approval to Roche's Tecentriq  in combination with Celgene's Abraxane for the treatment of adults with PD-L1-positive, metastatic triple-negative breast cancer - a difficult-to-treat cancer. The drug was approved for the same combination use by the FDA, on an accelerated basis, in March this year. The approval was based on encouraging data from the phase III IMpassion130 study.   AbbVie Ends Rova-T Program:   AbbVie discontinued development of its cancer candidate rovalpituzumab tesirine or Rova-T as the third study on the candidate, MERU, also failed. The MERU study was evaluating Rova-T as a first-line maintenance therapy for advanced small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) compared to placebo. Interim data from the study demonstrated no survival benefit for patients treated with Rova-T. The lack of survival benefit led the Independent Data Monitoring Committee to recommend terminating MERU. Rova-T was added to AbbVie's portfolio, following the $5.8 billion acquisition of Stemcentrx in June 2016. In December, AbbVie stopped enrollment in a pivotal phase III study -TAHOE - evaluating Rova-T in second-line SCLC. In March 2018, Rova-T fell short of expectations in a phase II TRINITY study evaluating it in third-line or later SCLC. The failure of TRINITY and the halt on TAHOE had already raised skepticism on Rova-T's potential. Discontinuation of the candidate has now broughtinto question the viability of the Stemcentrx deal.   Bristol-Myers Expects Celgene Acquisition to Close by   Year-End:   Bristol-Myers moved a step closer toward the closure of its pending acquisition of Celgene this week as the latter signed a deal with Amgen to divest global commercial rights to its blockbuster psoriasis drug, Otezla  . Amgen will pay $13.4 billion in cash for the same to Celgene. Back in June, Bristol-Myers had announced plans to divest Otezla to be able to close the acquisition of Celgene on a timely basis in light of concerns expressed by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The sale of Otezla should now make it easier for Bristol-Myers to get FTC's approval and will also fund a part of its massive $74 billion cost of buying Celgene. So, the deal looks like a win-win for Bristol-Myers, which expects the merger to close by the end of this year.

2019-09-03 06:37:00," You can simply arrive at a decision to buy or sell a particular stock by looking at its sales and earnings numbers. But such a strategy does not always warrant superior returns. A critical analysis of the company's financial background is always required for a better investment decision. A company's fundamentals should be sound enough to meet its financial obligations. This can be judged with coverage ratios - the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations. Here we have discussed one such ratio called interest coverage ratio.   Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest & Taxes   (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense   .  Why Interest Coverage Ratio?  Interest coverage ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charged on its debt. Debt, which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profits of a company and the company's creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, interest coverage ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision. Interest coverage ratio suggests the number of times interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest. An interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardship. Definitely, one should also track the company's past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.  What's the Strategy?  Apart from having an interest coverage ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  VGM Score   of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.  Interest coverage ratio greater than X-Industry   Median   Price greater than or equal to 5:  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.  5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median:  Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.  Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median:  This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.  Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000:  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.  Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2:  Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.

You can simply arrive at a decision to buy or sell a particular stock by looking at its sales and earnings numbers. But such a strategy does not always warrant superior returns. A critical analysis of the company's financial background is always required for a better investment decision.

A company's fundamentals should be sound enough to meet its financial obligations. This can be judged with coverage ratios - the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations. Here we have discussed one such ratio called interest coverage ratio.

  Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest & Taxes   (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense   .

 Why Interest Coverage Ratio? 

Interest coverage ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charged on its debt.

Debt, which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profits of a company and the company's creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, interest coverage ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.

Interest coverage ratio suggests the number of times interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.

An interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardship. Definitely, one should also track the company's past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.

 What's the Strategy? 

Apart from having an interest coverage ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  VGM Score   of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.

 Interest coverage ratio greater than X-Industry   Median 

 Price greater than or equal to 5:  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.

 5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median:  Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.

 Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median:  This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.

 Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000:  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.

 Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2:  Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.

 VGM Score of less than or equal to B:  Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. 

Here are five of the 24 stocks that qualified the screening:

 Skechers U.S.A., Inc. SKX  , which designs, develops, markets, and distributes footwear, has a VGM Score of A. This Zacks Rank #1 company has an expected EPS growth rate of 15% for 3-5 years. You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here   .

2019-09-03 09:15:00," SECTOR COMMENTARY 

The energy sector is set to kick off the shortened-holiday week lower, weighed down by weakness in the crude complex and broader equity futures which slid as the US's new round of tariffs on some Chinese goods kicked in over the weekend and after a report that officials from both sides were struggling to decide on the schedule for a meeting this month. The markets will also be looking towards manufacturing data later this morning which is expected to shed some light on the impact of the trade war on the trade-sensitive U.S. industrial sector and management comments coming out of the Barclays Energy conference over the next three days for feedback on the health of the space.

WTI crude oil futures were down over 2% this morning, marginally trailing Brent, pressured by reports of rising OPEC and Russian oil output as well as the protracted U.S.-China trade dispute. Reports this morning showed output from the OPEC rose in August for the first month in 2019, as higher supply from Iraq and Nigeria outweighed restraint by Saudi Arabia and losses caused by U.S. sanctions on Iran. That data also showed Russian oil production in August rose to 11.294 million bpd, topping the rate cap pledged by Moscow. The commodity markets are also digesting news that Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih is no longer on the board of directors of Aramco, replaced by the head of the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund, Yasir al-Rumayyan, as chairman.

Natural gas futures bucked the trend this morning and are up just over 0.25%, adding to last week's +6% gain on the impact Hurricane Dorian is having in the South East and on warming weather forecasts for key consuming regions

 U.S. INTEGRATEDS 

(Late Friday) Reuters - Major offshore oil and gas producers were evacuating non-essential staff from production platforms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico due to the threat from Hurricane Dorian.

Press Release - W&T Offshore announced that it has closed the previously-announced purchase of ExxonMobil  's interests in and operatorship of oil and gas producing properties in the eastern region of the Gulf of Mexico, offshore Alabama, and related onshore and offshore facilities and pipelines. After taking into account customary closing adjustments and an effective date of January 1, 2019, cash consideration paid by W&T was $167.6 million which includes a previously-funded $10 million deposit. The acquisition was funded by cash on hand and borrowings on its previously-undrawn revolving bank credit facility; W&T will also assume asset retirement obligations associated with these assets.

He added that Total intended to participate in an upcoming offshore wind bid round in Scotland as the firm continues to expand investments in low carbon and renewable energy. Total was not limited by funds to invest in low carbon power projects, but by the capacity to develop projects, he said.

(Monday) Press Release - Two new members have joined Total  's Executive Committee.

2019-09-03 08:59:34,"The U.S. futures are lower in early Tuesday trading following an escalation of tariffs last weekend. U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods were increased on Sunday while those on U.S. goods going into China increased yesterday. Both sides indicate talks will continue and display a willingness to resolve the dispute. The caveat is that no deal is in sight and negotiations remain stalled. The two sides are expected to meet later this month but what happens then, if anything, is anyone's guess. China has also taken the dispute to the WTO in hopes they will force a resolution however unlikely that is.

The major indices are all down about -0.80% to -0.85% in early trading. The chips stocks are in the lead but losses are broad if focused on international businesses. The retail sector is also moving lower because this latest round of tariffs is expected to impact consumers more than in the past. Later today, traders will be watching out for manufacturing PMI and construction spending figures. Later this week, economic data includes the ADP labor report, the NFP report, and ISM services. Next week the FOMC meets.

The European markets are moving lower at midday on Tuesday on growing geopolitical fears. While the U.S./China trade war is the driving force of global market action it is the Brexit drama that has the attention of traders in the EU. This week there is a chance a bi-partisan group of MPs will force an emergency debate, reopening Parliament, and effectively blocking the no-deal Hard-Brexit. PM Boris Johnson's ruling party has let it be known he will call for a snap election if the MPs are successful in their bid to take over control of Parliamentary direction.

The French CAC is leading the EU market lower with a loss of -0.45% while the DAX and FTSE trail with losses near -0.25%. In stock news , shares of Iliad are down nearly -2.75% after the company reported weaker than expected 1st half results.

In today's news, the Reserve Bank of Australia decided to hold rates steady but left the door open for future cuts. The banks chief said they are waiting to see what kind of boost the last two rate cuts would provide. The RBA also says to expect lower rates for an extended period of time. And that it doesn't think the last two cuts were enough to get inflation back on track.

2019-09-03 10:11:03,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Home Depot (NYSE: HD ) is much like its publicly traded equity: both don't draw much attention until you need them. Put another way, Home Depot stock is usually a safe, reliable investment, but it is a tad on the boring side.

However, shares have been doing something recently that they don't usually: being interesting. While the benchmark indices like the Dow Jones have been struggling to gain traction in August, the HD stock price has put on a remarkable run. Since the first of the month, shares gained nearly 7%.

But at the same time, Home Depot stock is at record levels. Typically, even the strongest and most stable names experience volatility in a market-wide downturn. Therefore, it seems unreasonable to jump aboard HD, especially when headwinds like the U.S.-China trade war and rising economic fears have gripped investors.

Of course, I can understand the concerns here. But if you want exposure to recession-resistant companies , HD stock is among your best bets. Here are three reasons why:

In retrospect, the late 1990s to early 2000s was the peak of American shopping malls' cultural influence. Since then, brick-and-mortar retailers had to contend with the threat of e-commerce. And when I - or anyone - refers to e-commerce, we're talking about Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ).

You only need to look at the technical charts for traditional retailers like Macy's (NYSE: M ) or Nordstrom (NYSE: JWN ) to recognize the damage rendered by Amazon. Although these two names are renowned brands across high-end shopping centers, they can't escape the ecommerce onslaught. But Home Depot stock? Fortunately for stakeholders, they won't have to worry about digital disruption.

The biggest reason why is that most people who shop at Home Depot do so for renovations or repairs. Neither is an exact science, which essentially insulates the HD stock price from Amazon's encroachment.

From my experience with repair work done on my home, the process is a hit-or-miss affair: pipes don't quite work right, or components somehow are either too big or too small. And don't get me started on repainting the interior. I had no clue how many different shades of white existed.

I say all this to illustrate a point: Home Depot's business necessitates a physical presence. In fact, going digital would be a nuisance to its millions of customers. Therefore, I'm confident that the HD stock price can hold up better than most retail names.

During bull markets, cyclical investments like tech stocks get all the love. And that's really not a surprise. When the money is flowing, people feel comfortable tacking on greater risk. If their investments fail, hey, the money is still coming in from other sources.

But in recessionary markets, Home Depot stock and its rivals like Lowe's Companies (NYSE: LOW ) fare better than their high-growth counterparts. It's much easier to predict the company's revenue streams but there's not as much guesswork involved. Aside from obvious technological improvements, construction materials are construction materials.

Moreover, HD stock benefits from consistent, secular demand. Yes, a recession will hurt Home Depot like it would any other company. However, consumers don't really have a choice if they the home-improvement giant's services.

Again, I speak from personal experience, but I suspect your experiences aren't dissimilar: your plumbing doesn't decide to conk out based on when it's most convenient to your schedule.

Plus, I actually see some potential tailwinds for Home Depot stock if we suffer a recession. For instance, home sales have been plummeting even prior to the trade war escalation. Also, the average price of homes sold has started to flatline . Understandably, people are hesitant toward exposing themselves to unnecessary financial risk.

But homeowners might take advantage of this lull and focus instead on renovating their properties. Then, when housing comes back, they could reap greater returns. Invariably, such circumstances will only help bolster HD stock.

Turn on the news and chances are, you'll hear various analyses about the longer-term impact of the U.S.-China trade war. And while Home Depot stock does have a secular, insular business, it too suffers from supply chain cost increases.

According to Home Depot CEO Craig Menear, the tariffs on Chinese goods will have a ""cost impact"" on U.S. revenue. This amounts to 2%, or $2 billion.

However, the company's suppliers have thought ahead, shifting some manufacturing outside China . These location shifts are toward friendlier nations, including Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand, even back home stateside.

Of course, retailers broadly have pushed these cost increases to their customers and that worries economists. But for Home Depot stock, burdening the consumer base isn't as atrocious as it is for a discretionary-spending retailer.

I go back to the point about secular demand. If your home needs repair, you're going to pay the increased material costs because you have to. While it's a cynical situation, it really does favor HD stock.

As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-03 13:55:00,"Executive Summary:

Start to finish August was jam packed with an extensive list of geopolitical events, provocative tweets, multiple fresh tariff announcements, and extreme market actions/reactions which combined triggered widespread risk-off sentiment while increasing the probability that the eventual recession is now on the clock.

On the final day in July the Fed cut the overnight rate for the first time in twelve years, but a not so clear Chairman Powell described it as a ""mid-cycle adjustment"" and not the start of a typical rate cut cycle.  The ""hawkish cut"" led to a bullish breakout in the greenback to fresh two year highs, followed by President Trump tweeting ""Powell let us down …"" In hindsight Trump's typically harsh response proved relatively tame compared to his tweet later month, ""who is our bigger enemy, Jay Powell or Chairman Xi?"" which followed increased tariffs by China and Powell's ""neutral"" remarks at Jackson Hole.

The U.S - China trade war escalation commenced in the first week of August when Trump responded to the Fed's ""hawkish cut"" by announcing plans for a 10% tariff on the remaining $300B in Chinese of Chinese goods imported into the U.S.  While their implementation was later postponed to December, the damage was done.  On Monday August 5 th China allowed the Yuan to depreciate above the psychologically important 7 level for the first time since August 2008, while directing its state-owned companies to suspend imports of US agricultural products.  The Trump administration immediately countered with a symbolic move by formerly labeling China a currency manipulator, an act Trump pledged to do during his 2016 campaign.  Later in the month on day two of the Jackson Hole symposium and ahead of Chairman Powell's speech, China announced new tariffs of 10% and 15% against the remaining $75B in U.S. imports.  The new tariffs combined with Powell's ""middle of the road speech"" incensed Trump into a twitter storm which among other things ordered U.S. companies to immediately start looking for an alternative to China.

Fed independence was a theme throughout August, likely in response to President Trump's ongoing rebuke of Chairman Powell.  An August 6 th Op-Ed in the WSJ signed by four former Federal Reserve Chairs (Volcker, Greenspan, Bernanke, and Yellen) emphasized the importance of a Fed Chair who is ""permitted to act independently and in the best interests of the economy, free of short-term political pressures and, in particular, without the threat of removal or demotion"".  Three weeks later an eye-opening Op-Ed in Bloomberg by William Dudley, the former President of the New York Federal Reserve from 2009 - 2018 and vice chairman of the FOMC, argued the Fed should ""refuse to play along"" with Trump's bad policy in regards to the trade war with China.  In the closing paragraph Dudley proclaimed ""there's even an argument that the election itself falls within the Fed's purview …. Fed officials should consider how their decisions will affect the political outcome in 2020.""  Interesting times indeed!

The exhausting news flow comingled with contracting economic data both overseas and at home led to historic declines in global sovereign rates, a full inversion of the yield curve with the 30YR yield moving below the overnight rate, an inversion of the 10YR-2YR spread for the first time this cycle, and a 21% increase MoM in negative yielding bonds.

In equities the major indices all saw declines.  Large cap outperformed small, defensives outperformed cyclicals, and notably growth outperformed value.  The Dow Jones Industrials (-1.8%) and S&P 500 (-1.9%) performed relatively better than the Russell 2000 (-5.1%) and the Russell Microcap (-6.5%) indices.

The higher yielding Utilities (+4.6%), REITs (+4.7%), and Consumer Staples (+1.6%) were the only sectors to finish in the green.  On the opposite end of the spectrum were energy (-8.7%), financials (-5.1%), and Materials (-3.1%) which faced stiff headwinds from the deteriorating global growth, the escalating trade war, and collapsing rates/inverted curve.

The U.S. Consumer:  Consumer strength has been an enduring theme fueling the longest bull run in history and the story largely remains intact. Historically low unemployment, year-over-year positive wage growth, and strong retail sales have helped create an environment that continues to fuel economic growth. To that effect, consumer spend accounts for nearly 2/3rds of U.S. GDP.

The U.S. - China trade war has escalated this month with a tit-for-tat promise of higher tariffs. This saber rattling has reintroduced volatility to the markets, but what party will bear the higher costs of trade?  What will the impact be to the consumer and how much can merchants pass along?  Will the consumer accept these increased costs?  And will there be a continued spending shift such as we have been witnessing (bricks vs. clicks), or even another evolution as folks spend more on experiences and entertainment instead of material items. Let's take a look at August's data to see where we are heading.

July's producer price index (PPI) numbers (released in early August) were in-line with analyst expectations, but core prices (ex-food & energy) declined for first time since early 2017. This left the index for final demand up +1.7% Y/o/Y. The key takeaway from the report is that inflationary pressures remain muted.

Consumer inflation data is a focal point for the Federal Reserve and the capital markets. Both the July consumer price index (CPI) headline and the core monthly numbers rose by 0.3%. The headline number was in-line, but July's core CPI report was hotter than expected posting the biggest back-to-back monthly increase of prices of goods paid by consumers since 2006.

Retail sales for July surprised to the upside showing unexpected consumer strength (+0.7% MoM vs. consensus +0.3% and were up +1% ex-autos vs consensus +0.3%). The report offered a clear reminder that the U.S. consumer is still in good shape.

A shift in consumer spending is not necessarily a bad thing, though it could be devastating to a specific business. More broadly any signs of a weakening consumer should be taken seriously as a harbinger of a declining U.S. economy.

Commodities & the Dollar:

The continued decline in the global economy and in particular the global manufacturing recession (seven of 10 largest global economies posted sub-50 PMI for July, joined then by the U.S. with sub-50 reading in August) contributed to a 5.9% decline in crude oil.

The euro heavy U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) gained a modest 0.4% in August but finished on a strong note gaining 1.3% gain in the final week to close at fresh two-year highs, 98.92.  The EURUSD currency pair closed below the 1.10 threshold as Euro continues a weakening trend.  The pair is now continuing lower towards its 2014 and 2016 lows at 1.034 - 1.045.   Along with the increasing risk of a ""no-deal"" Brexit, the greenback continues to attract flows due both to its safe haven status, as well as the sharp escalation in negative yielding debt.  On the latter front, the level of negative yielding bonds globally increased 21% in the month of August to $17T.

While the dollar is at multi-year highs, in atypical fashion so too is gold.  Spot gold and silver gained 7.5% and 13% in August.  While gold is commonly known as its role as a hedge against inflation, it is also as a hedge against instability.  And with more than $17T of negative yielding debt, the return of capital vs. a return of capital makes it that much more alluring.  The gold and silver miner ETF's (GDX and SIL) are +41.6% and +23.4% YTD.

Rates:

The decline in Treasury yields was been nothing short of historic.  At the August low, 1.44%, the 10YR yield was down 57bps which if it held there would have marked the largest net decline on a closing basis since December 2008.  Both the 10YR and 30YR yields registered their 2nd biggest monthly declines in more than years.  The 10YR came within 12bps of its 2016 all-time lows while the 30YR made a new record low, 1.90%.  The explosive downside momentum left the 10YR and 30YR yields with weekly RSI's at 17 and 18, levels not seen since October 1998.  And the 30YR yield joined the rest of the curve to officially close below the overnight fed Funds Rate (FFR).

Earnings:

In Q2 75% of companies reported earnings above estimates, slightly below the one-year average (76%) but above the five-year average (72%).  Companies also reported earnings that were 5.6% above estimates, above the one-year (5.2%) and five-year averages (4.8%).

However, all is not rosy.  Sales beats were below average (56% vs 63% for one year and 60% for five years.)  Put another way, 43% of companies reported actual sales below estimated sales.

Earnings also fell 0.7%, the first time S&P 500 companies reported two consecutive quarters of y/y earnings declines since Q2 2016.  Revenue growth of 4.1% was also the lowest since Q3 2016.

Five sectors reported year-over-year growth in earnings, led by the Health Care and Financials sectors. Six sectors reported year-over-year declines in earnings, led by the Materials and Industrials sectors.

There was also a 40% increase in S&P 500 companies citing tariffs on earnings conference call s.  According to FactSet, 124 companies (28% pf 438 searched) cited the term tariff with Industrials having 35 companies mentioning the term.  In Q1, the total number of mentions was 88.  Until this quarter, the numbers had been declining (table below).

Perhaps most concerning, earnings estimates for the second half of 2019 are falling.  Analysts now expect a Q3 earnings decline of 3.1% followed by 3.9% growth in Q4.   In the first quarter, these estimates were +1.7% and +8.3%.

Volatility:

We noted in our last monthly report that ""August seasonality is also not favorable.  Over the last ten years August has been the worst performing month, and since 1950 it has been the 2 nd worst performer.""

Well, August lived up to his reputation as a tough month for stocks.  It was the second worst performing month so far in 2019 with a 1.8% decline, though at mid-month, when the S&P 500 was down 6.8% and the Dow shed 2,000 points, it looked like it could be worse.  The last three years have seen a tame August but in 2010, 2011 and 2015 stocks lost more at 4.8%, 5.7% and 6.3% respectively.

August had 11 days in which the S&P 500 moved 1% or more, far surpassing January's six.  The four declines of this magnitude also tied May for the most.  There were also seven gains of 1% or more.  The issue of course was that the declining sessions saw greater moves than the ones with gains, with three downward 2%+ moves against no similar gains.

However, one gets the feeling it could have been worse.  Coming off the aforementioned 2,000 Dow point decline we said ""we are virtually assured to see more sharp moves - but are still at about 2018 levels of volatility"".   Since then, despite some unhelpful comments on trade and continued warning signals from the bond market we've had four moves of 1% or more but three of those were gains (weighted against a 2.6% loss).  Meanwhile, the VIX Index has fallen from the 22 level to the current 18.98.

Once volatility is unleashed it's hard to suppress it, so we won't say we are out of the woods just yet, especially since President Trump still has a Twitter account.  September is historically the worst month for the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes.  Over the past 10 years, the month has been a bit more constructive than August, with a 10-year trailing average return of +0.86% vs. the -0.78% decline in August but still has the potential to be volatile.

Looking Ahead:

Markets could remain on edge in September not simply because of poor seasonal trends, but more so due to the plethora of escalating geopolitical risks and uncertainty.  Tariff escalation is now leading some economists to reduce their China 2020 GDP forecasts to below 6%, the lowest levels seen in three decades.  Meanwhile in mid-August Germany reported a -0.1% Q2 GDP as its manufacturing sector fell deeper into contraction territory.  PM Boris Johnson is striving to take the U.K. out of the European Union on October 31 st , with or without a deal.

In the U.S. the surging greenback should weigh on inflationary pressures and encourage more angst by Trump against the Fed.  The 10YR-2YR UST inversion has unofficially put recession on the clock, however this is not a timing signal to get ""beared up.""  According to Canaccord's Tony Dwyer, the last three cycles that have been similarly fueled by an excessive use of leverage, following the initial inversion of the curve the SPX rallies a median 34% in 22 months with a recession 24 months away.""  Over the last four weeks the SPX has been range bound between 2,820 and 2,944.  And despite all the extensive list of aforementioned headwinds, it closed August just 3% from all-time highs.  All bull markets have their own wall of worry to climb.  This one is certainly being put to the test.

2019-09-03 09:26:03,"I learned a long time ago not to count on central banks to bail out your position. Even those with short memories recall the carnage following the Swiss National Bank’s decision to abandon its support of the EURCHF 1.20 peg January 2015

A central bank being forced out of the market after failed interventions is not new. President Trump and his advisors should study the forex history books before deciding whether to intervene to weaken the dollar,’

Let’s take a look at different types of forex intervention and which tend to be most effective.

Types of Intervention

1) Unilateral or Coordinated

Intervention can take the form of being unilateral (i.e. one central acting alone) or coordinated (i.e. various central banks acting in concert).

2) Sterilized or Unsterilized

The results of the intervention (i.e. buying or selling a currency) can be sterilized or left unsterilized. When a central bank sterilizes intervention, it offsets the impact of buying or selling its currency through intervention by adding or draining reserves from its domestic money market. When intervention is left unsterilized, the central bank allows the full impact of such actions to either increase or reduce the supply of liquidity.

3) Overt Intervention

A central bank may look for the shock effect by being visible in its forex intervention. This overt intervention may see the central bank surprise the market and come in via an electronic platform, which gets flashed across wore services. This often sees a sharp reaction in the market but the more times employed, the less impact it tends to have.

4) Covert Intervention

A central bank may prefer to keep traders guessing and intervene covertly. In this way all traders get are rumors as the intervention is not publicized.

One method of covert intervention is through the use of surrogates to buy or sell its currency. In this way it can disguise its actions and keep the market guessing. Some call this stealth intervention. There is speculation that the Japan’s MOF (Ministry of Finance) and Bank of Japan have employed this tactic for years but only insiders know whether this is true and if so, to what extent it is used.

5) Managed Float

Those countries with managed currency regimes have become a factor in intervention. In these cases, the central bank uses the proceeds from forex intervention to adjust its currency reserve basket to maintain the ratio of dollars and other currencies. Central banks often use this tactic to keep its currency from appreciating although it can work on both sides.

(Note. our Brexit poll was one of the only surveys to call the outcome dead on from the start) 

Which types of intervention tend to be most effective?

As a rule, it is easier for a central bank to intervene to slow the appreciation of its currency than to support a falling currency. Intervention tends to be more effective when accompanied by other measures, such as an increase/decrease in interest rates to make a currency more/less attractive.

Coordinated forex intervention is generally more effective than unilateral intervention in the currency market. The most notable example is the 1986 Plaza Accord, where the G-7 countries agreed to work together to drive down an overvalued USD. It is more difficult for a country, acting alone, to intervene effectively.

Unsterilized intervention is more effective than sterilized intervention. Traders look to see if central banks sterilize intervention and allow the buying or selling to increase or decrease (as the case may be) the supply of its currency. Most interventions tend to be sterilized as central banks take offsetting measures to limit the impact on domestic monetary conditions.

The more predictable a central bank is in its interventions the less the impact each time employed. This may be referred to as the law of diminishing returns as the market gets used to it and adjusts its strategies accordingly. The initial reaction to a surprise intervention tends to have the greatest impact. Traders also look to see whether the central bank intervenes at lower/higher levels or gets aggressive by continuing to buy/sell at higher/lower levels. The latter tends to see the most impact but runs a risk as once the central bank steps back the market tends to reverse some of the earlier moves.

Stealth intervention is more of a gray area. The market only suspects intervention when a central bank uses surrogates to intervene and a lot depends on how much it wants to keep the market guessing.

The Bank of Japan and Ministry of Finance tend to be secretive but the market suspects they have been employing stealth intervention for years. One reason may be that they do not want to be accused of trying to engineer an undervalued currency. Given Japan’s dependence on exports, there is suspicion that it tries to limit the JPY upside to help its exporters through stealth intervention, thereby avoiding any criticism from other trading partner countries.

Reserve Management is used with a managed float, a strategy often employed by emerging market countries to limit the appreciation of their currencies. This is especially true of periods when the dollar is weak. The way this works is a central bank buys dollars to limit its currency’s upside and then diversifies by selling some of those dollars to convert into other currencies to maintain the allocation of its reserve basket. If selling dollars to manage its float, the central bank buys back some of those dollars and sells other currencies in its reserve bask to maintain the percentage allocations and vice versa of buying dollars.

So when you hear that a central bank intervenes, you have to explore further to assess its potential impact and adjust your strategies accordingly. Is it unilateral or coordinated? Are there any additional measures taken to support the intervention? How visible is the central bank intervention? Is there stealth intervention going on? What is the impact on major currencies from intervention to maintain a managed float? These just scratch the surface but give some insights into forex intervention.

2019-09-03 08:50:00,"  DexCom, Inc. DXCM  is well poised for growth on the back of lucrative glucose monitoring market, solid international market presence and robust product portfolio. However, contraction in margin remains a woe.  makeArticleAd();  The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).   Price Performance    Shares of DexCom have gained 17.5%, against the industry  's decline of 5.5% in a year's time. Moreover, the S&P 500 Index declined 0.3% in the same timeframe.     What's Deterring the Stock?    Increase in expenses tends to weigh on the company's margins. In the second quarter, DexCom generated gross margin (as a percentage of revenues) of 65.9%, which contracted 360 bps on a year-over-year basis. Margins were under pressure owing to an inventory change, and shift toward OUS and Medicare.    DexCom continues to bear the brunt of intense competition in the blood glucose monitoring devices market as it is subject to rapid change and can be substantially affected by new product introductions. This in turn is likely to mar the company's overall performance.   What's Favoring the Stock?    DexCom continues to gain from the lucrative and growing glucose monitoring market that presents substantial commercial opportunity. Per an article of Research and Markets, the blood glucose monitoring devices market is expected to witness a CAGR of over 9% between 2018 and 2024.    Moreover, the company boasts of a robust product portfolio, which in turn has been bolstering overall performance. Per management, the company is well poised to achieve long-term target on the back of the expansion of the rollout of G6 and improved access to CGM. With this growing demand in mind, the company is on track to meet its goal of doubling G6 capacity by the end of 2019.    Per management, DexCom remains optimistic regarding CGM as a diagnostic tool. Also, the company recently submitted its G6 Pro product, which it expects to launch in 2020.    DexCom continues to benefit from strong international presence and is eyeing the sizeable markets of Korea, India, China and Japan. If we go by statistics then more than half of the diabetic population in developing nations remain undiagnosed. Consequently, the company can boost sales by expanding into overseas territory, where the momentum is anticipated to continue in the future.    Additionally, the company's strategic collaborations and buyouts continue to bolster growth. DexCom has collaborative agreements with several companies, which should not only bring in cash in the form of milestone payments and royalties but should also help expand product use.   Which Way Are Estimates Headed?    For 2019, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.36 billion, indicating an improvement of 32.2% from the year-ago period.

2019-09-03 12:09:12,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Just because headlines are terrorizing Wall Street of late, it doesn't mean that investors should be crippled by them. Even amidst this geopolitical whirlwind of uncertainties, there are stocks to buy now. Today we focus on three mega-caps that are proven winners but deserve more attention from investors now. These are Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOGL ), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT ).

Since the short-term price action in the S&P 500 is still in flux and since there is the possibility of another dip near term, we will consider both sides of the argument for GOOGL, AAPL and CAT stock. But for now, my thesis is still bullish so I expect a resumption to new highs once the headlines abate.

This is not the same as saying that I expect the politicians to resolve the conflicts. We can make new highs even while the economic push-pull is ongoing.

This is a short week on Wall Street due to Labor day, but it won't be short of excitement. In addition to the Hong Kong standoff and the new tariffs hitting this weekend, investors have to contend with headlines from the release of many important reports. Mid-week the Federal Reserve will release its Beige Book. These are their reports from the economic front lines in each region. Then on Friday, the government will release its official non-farm payroll for the month.

These are important events because they are line items that the Fed uses to determine their next move on rates. So in effect, the direction in the stock market will depend heavily on this week's progression of headlines.

Simply stated, GOOGL stock is trading in a tight range, so a move is coming. The idea is to chase the breaches of either sides of the lines.

For the long term, Alphabet stock's fundamentals are solid. Short of a big, sustainable equity market crash, or severe negative change in its operations, GOOGL stock is headed higher for years to come. Meanwhile, there are short-term technical signals to watch.

GOOGL stock spiked 10% on earnings but faded back down into the $1,160 per share neckline. Since then, it has consolidated well inside a $60 range, and therein lies the opportunity.

Usually when a stock ping-pongs inside a tight box, it resolves itself with a big move once it breaks out of it. In this case, the GOOGL stock traders have not yet committed to the direction of said move. So the best trade setup is to wait for the actual breach of either side of the range and chase it in that direction.

So this is a tactical trade on GOOGL stock. If the bulls break above $1,211 per share, then they can rally $30 then another $40 from there. Keep in mind that this is the entire span of the GOOGL stock 7% dip on April earnings.

I prefer betting on upside then shorting, But the opposite is also true. So conversely, if the bears are able to push GOOGL stock below $1,150 per share, they could target $1,080 per share. Incidentally, there is a gap there from early July. Also there is likely to be some support around $1119.

Although these are tactical trade setups, those interested in owning Alphabet stock for the longer-term can use the upside scenario for timing. Or, I wait for the dip to happen then add the bullish fundamental position in it.

AAPL stock is also technically trading in a tight range so here too we should anticipate a move soon. While I am optimistic that it is still in great shape to break through the recent highs, there is also risk below.

Last week, AAPL announced an event on Sept. 10. The stock often fades after the fact, so onus is on the bulls to prove that this time it's different. Otherwise, AAPL stock is vulnerable to a 7% correction with some supports at $201 and $198. But if $192.50 fails then Apple could fall another $11 from there.

While the Apple fundamentals are not as strong as they used to be, the company still has many more years of prosperity. Currently there is a blemish on that from it being in the direct line of fire in this economic war between the US and China. But eventually it trades on its own merits.

The Apple stock price-to-earnings ratio sells at a discount to its peers. Furthermore, management is finally making tangible headway in diversifying their income statement from the iPhone. ""Apple services"" is the buzzword for the next decade, so AAPL is still a stock to buy for the long term.

Just like GOOGL, the short-term AAPL stock trade is binary and stuck inside a range. The bullish setup is to buy Apple stock when it breaks through $212 - or better yet, $214.50 per share. Those should be triggers to invite more momentum buyers. There are resistance zones above but with a little bit of headline luck the buyers could pierce through them.

It is also important that if the bulls sustain the buying through $210. Otherwise it would trigger some technical selling that could develop into a nasty multi-leg correction to test the March and May lows.

Coming into the Labor Day weekend, CAT stock had a great three day bounce off $112 per share. But it is best to wait for confirmation that it can continue its uptrend especially into a binary week like this. So the better setup is to chase CAT stock above $120 or better yet $122 per share for a $10 rally potential.

Caterpillar stock is way too cheap, but that alone is not reason enough to chase it. For many reasons, the bulls have failed to sustain rallies causing many fake-out losses. It is enticing because it sells at only an 11 price-to-earnings ratio and it yields 3.5% in dividends. So those who own the CAT stock are indeed suffering from the price action. But they are at least getting some reward from a yield that is twice that of 10-year bonds.

The threats to CAT stock stem first from the overall fears that we are headed into a global recession and second from the threat to Caterpillar from the economic war rhetoric. In the past year we've seen this affect the stock price negatively several times.

The company is still executing well on plans, but the stock is still acting like death. Even though fundamentally the company looks good, short-term it is best to watch for technical pitfalls.

First is that the $120 zone is resistance. This is a long-term pivot area and the bulls recently lost it. So onus is on them to prove that they can recover it. It won't be easy since the CAT stock bears are likely emboldened by the price action.

The pattern that developed since the October correction of 2018 resembles a big bearish head and shoulders. If that's the case, then CAT stock has about $20 more to fall. But the bears will have to work for it. Because they would have to slice through a thick layer of support.

The bulls have the bounce levels from the December 2018 and August of this year correction bottoms in Caterpillar stock. This is also the 50% retracement from the 2-year long and 200% rally of 2016. Those who believe in Fibonacci will tell you that the 50% retracement is reliable support.

More to that, this is also a monthly pivot zone that dates back to 2011. Clearly the bulls and bears like to fight it out there so this creates congestion.

Those who are long CAT stock here should know that there is a real threat that if $110 fails. It could lose $25 per share from there. Incidentally, this measured target is also the five year point-of-control. But conversely, any resolution on the tariff front could launch a roaring rally to $133 per share.

So of the three stocks today, this is the one that needs a miracle headline the most to get it out of its current funk. So depending on the investor's time frames, traders should use stops. If the goal is to trade CAT stock, then you shouldn't turn it into an investment. Losing $116.34 could fill the gap and overshoot to Aug. 28 lows. Below $112 per share, there's plenty of room the fall.

Even though the fundamentals for GOOGL, AAPL and CAT stocks suggest that these are stocks to buy, the short-term price action is tactical due to extraneous reasons.

But in the end, I expect that the fear of trade wars and recessions to abate.  So I am inclined to trade the upside scenarios either by chasing the breakouts, or buying the measured targets from the short term dips this week. Tactically, there is something for both bulls and bears to trade in all three stocks here.

2019-09-03 09:08:00,"  For Immediate Release  Chicago, IL -September 3, 2019 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: KLA-Tencor Corp. KLAC  , Microsoft Corp. MSFT  , Alphabet Inc. GOOGL  , Lattice Semiconductor Corp. LSCC  and PayPal Holdings Inc. PYPL  .  Here are highlights from Friday's Analyst Blog:    5 Top Tech Stocks on U.S.-China Trade Prospects   Wall Street has heaved a sigh of relief, at least for the time being, on the trade war front between the United States and China. U.S. stocks rallied following a hint from the Chinese government that it may not retaliate against a new set of tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump immediately. Rather, the Asian economic powerhouse will try to resolve the prolonging trade dispute calmly. The news bolstered the confidence of market participants on risky assets like equities. All three major stock indexes -- the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite -- surged 1.3%, 1.3% and 1.5%, respectively. Notably, within the broad market S&P 500 Index, the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) gained 1.7%, the highest among total 11 sectors.  China Calls for ""Calm Attitude"" to Resolve Trade   Conflict  On Aug 29, Bloomberg reported that Gao Feng, spokesman for China's Ministry of Commerce, told reports in Beijing, ""We firmly reject an escalation of the trade war, and are willing to negotiate and collaborate in order to solve this problem with calm attitude."" The statement for Chinese authority came just two days before the U.S. government is scheduled to impose new rate of tariffs on $550 billion of Chinese goods. Gao's statement clearly showed that the Asian economic giant is more eager to carry forward trade talks with its U.S. counterparts, instead of retaliating and escalating the situation further. Gao further said that the primary goal of his country is to remove new U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports. Additionally, in an interview with Fox News Radio, Donald Trump said that the United States and China are set to discuss trade dispute on Aug 29 ""at a different level."" However, Trump stopped short of describing what ""a different level ""means. As per CNBC, a White House correspondence said ""both sides remain in communication at various levels."" Notably, the tariff war between the two largest trading nations of the world heightened on Aug 23 after China announced that it will impose 5% to 10% tariff on another $75 billion of U.S. goods in two tranches, on Sep 1 and Dec 15. Additionally, a 25% tariff on U.S. auto products and auto parts will be imposed effective Dec 15. In retaliation, President Donald Trump decided to raise tariff to 30% from the existing 25% on $250 billion Chinese goods. Moreover, he also raised the tariff from 10% to 15%, which is to be levied on an additional $300 billion of Chinese exports effective Sep 1.  Why Trade Solution is Important for Tech Sector  China is the largest trading partner of the United States. Moreover, China plays the role of a low-cost supplier of intermediary products and other inputs to high-tech U.S. industries. In 2018, the Trump administration levied tariffs on Chinese goods worth $250 billion. Most of these products were from the high-tech industrial sectors. U.S. companies that rely on Chinese imports are unhappy about the move as it raised prices of high-tech equipment and several electronics products. On the other hand, a trade spat with the United States resulted in a significant slowdown of China's economy. However, a strong Chinese economy will give U.S. high-tech companies a solid boost as China is also the largest market for U.S. high-tech products. At this juncture, an amicable solution to the U.S.-China trade war is likely to restore Chinese and global economic growth, which in turn will create demand for high-tech U.S. products. Likewise, repeal of tariffs on Chinese intermediary goods will raise the profit margin of U.S. tech giants.

We have narrowed down our search to five such tech stocks that have popped in the past six months despite facing trade-induced market volatility. Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

  5 Top Tech Stocks on U.S.-China Trade Prospects  

Wall Street has heaved a sigh of relief, at least for the time being, on the trade war front between the United States and China. U.S. stocks rallied following a hint from the Chinese government that it may not retaliate against a new set of tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump immediately. Rather, the Asian economic powerhouse will try to resolve the prolonging trade dispute calmly.

The news bolstered the confidence of market participants on risky assets like equities. All three major stock indexes -- the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite -- surged 1.3%, 1.3% and 1.5%, respectively. Notably, within the broad market S&P 500 Index, the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) gained 1.7%, the highest among total 11 sectors.

 China Calls for ""Calm Attitude"" to Resolve Trade   Conflict 

On Aug 29, Bloomberg reported that Gao Feng, spokesman for China's Ministry of Commerce, told reports in Beijing, ""We firmly reject an escalation of the trade war, and are willing to negotiate and collaborate in order to solve this problem with calm attitude.""

The statement for Chinese authority came just two days before the U.S. government is scheduled to impose new rate of tariffs on $550 billion of Chinese goods. Gao's statement clearly showed that the Asian economic giant is more eager to carry forward trade talks with its U.S. counterparts, instead of retaliating and escalating the situation further. Gao further said that the primary goal of his country is to remove new U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports.

Additionally, in an interview with Fox News Radio, Donald Trump said that the United States and China are set to discuss trade dispute on Aug 29 ""at a different level."" However, Trump stopped short of describing what ""a different level ""means. As per CNBC, a White House correspondence said ""both sides remain in communication at various levels.""

Notably, the tariff war between the two largest trading nations of the world heightened on Aug 23 after China announced that it will impose 5% to 10% tariff on another $75 billion of U.S. goods in two tranches, on Sep 1 and Dec 15. Additionally, a 25% tariff on U.S. auto products and auto parts will be imposed effective Dec 15.

In retaliation, President Donald Trump decided to raise tariff to 30% from the existing 25% on $250 billion Chinese goods. Moreover, he also raised the tariff from 10% to 15%, which is to be levied on an additional $300 billion of Chinese exports effective Sep 1.

 Why Trade Solution is Important for Tech Sector 

China is the largest trading partner of the United States. Moreover, China plays the role of a low-cost supplier of intermediary products and other inputs to high-tech U.S. industries. In 2018, the Trump administration levied tariffs on Chinese goods worth $250 billion. Most of these products were from the high-tech industrial sectors. U.S. companies that rely on Chinese imports are unhappy about the move as it raised prices of high-tech equipment and several electronics products.

On the other hand, a trade spat with the United States resulted in a significant slowdown of China's economy. However, a strong Chinese economy will give U.S. high-tech companies a solid boost as China is also the largest market for U.S. high-tech products.

At this juncture, an amicable solution to the U.S.-China trade war is likely to restore Chinese and global economic growth, which in turn will create demand for high-tech U.S. products. Likewise, repeal of tariffs on Chinese intermediary goods will raise the profit margin of U.S. tech giants.

2019-09-03 09:12:00,"  Ciena Corporation CIEN  is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2019 financial results (ended Jul 31, 2019) before the opening bell on Sep 5. In the las t report  ed quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 20%. Markedly, Ciena surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 18.8%.  makeArticleAd();  The company is likely to report higher revenues year over year on the back of increased sales in all major product segments and customer verticals, resulting from gains in market share. Whether this can result into an earnings beat remains to be seen.    Proper execution of operational strategies coupled with a strong set of favorable industry dynamics has benefitted Ciena's business. Let's find out how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.   Factors at Play    Ciena continues to strengthen its competitive position particularly with its focused investments in Optical Packets and Blue Planet automation software. The company is consistently achieving technology leadership across its portfolio and continues to build a diversified customer base in high-growth markets.    FiberLight, a long-haul fiber transport service provider, selected automation software from Blue Planet, a division of Ciena, to improve service delivery process across its multi-vendor network. FiberLight deployed Blue Planet Inventory and Blue Planet Multi-Domain Service Orchestration to automate the rapid turn-up and delivery of the on-demand services of its customers.    In the fiscal third quarter, management expects to deliver revenues in the range of $915 million to $945 million and adjusted gross margin in the 42% to 43% range. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues stands at $931 million, indicating an increase from $819 million reported in the year-earlier quarter. Adjusted earnings per share are pegged at 57 cents. The company reported earnings of 48 cents a year ago.   What Our Model Says    Our proven model does not conclusively show that Ciena is likely to bea t earnings  estimates this quarter as it does not possess one of the two key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you'll see below:   Earnings ESP:  Ciena's Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00% as both are pegged at 57 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter  .   Ciena Corporation Price and EPS Surprise       Ciena Corporation price-eps-surprise    |   Ciena Corporation Quote    Zacks Rank:  Ciena currently has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company's 0.00% Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.    Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.   Stocks to Consider    Here are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:    Zumiez Inc. ZUMZ  with an Earnings ESP of +12.50% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here   .    General Mills, Inc. GIS  with an Earnings ESP of +0.37% and a Zacks Rank #2.    Lululemon Athletica Inc. LULU  with an Earnings ESP of +1.77% and a Zacks Rank #3.   Legalizing THIS Could Be Even Bigger than Marijuana    Americans spend an estimated $150 billion in this industry every year… more than twice as much as they spend on marijuana.    Now that 8 states have fully-legalized it (with several more states following close behind), Zacks has identified 5 stocks that could soar in response to the powerful demand. One industry insider described the future as ""mind-blowing"" - and early investors can still get in ahead of the surge.

Proper execution of operational strategies coupled with a strong set of favorable industry dynamics has benefitted Ciena's business. Let's find out how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.   Factors at Play    Ciena continues to strengthen its competitive position particularly with its focused investments in Optical Packets and Blue Planet automation software. The company is consistently achieving technology leadership across its portfolio and continues to build a diversified customer base in high-growth markets.    FiberLight, a long-haul fiber transport service provider, selected automation software from Blue Planet, a division of Ciena, to improve service delivery process across its multi-vendor network. FiberLight deployed Blue Planet Inventory and Blue Planet Multi-Domain Service Orchestration to automate the rapid turn-up and delivery of the on-demand services of its customers.    In the fiscal third quarter, management expects to deliver revenues in the range of $915 million to $945 million and adjusted gross margin in the 42% to 43% range. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues stands at $931 million, indicating an increase from $819 million reported in the year-earlier quarter. Adjusted earnings per share are pegged at 57 cents. The company reported earnings of 48 cents a year ago.   What Our Model Says    Our proven model does not conclusively show that Ciena is likely to bea t earnings  estimates this quarter as it does not possess one of the two key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you'll see below:   Earnings ESP:  Ciena's Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00% as both are pegged at 57 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter  .   Ciena Corporation Price and EPS Surprise

 Zacks Rank:  Ciena currently has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company's 0.00% Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.    Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.   Stocks to Consider    Here are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:    Zumiez Inc. ZUMZ  with an Earnings ESP of +12.50% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here   .    General Mills, Inc. GIS  with an Earnings ESP of +0.37% and a Zacks Rank #2.    Lululemon Athletica Inc. LULU  with an Earnings ESP of +1.77% and a Zacks Rank #3.   Legalizing THIS Could Be Even Bigger than Marijuana    Americans spend an estimated $150 billion in this industry every year… more than twice as much as they spend on marijuana.    Now that 8 states have fully-legalized it (with several more states following close behind), Zacks has identified 5 stocks that could soar in response to the powerful demand. One industry insider described the future as ""mind-blowing"" - and early investors can still get in ahead of the surge.    See these 5 ""sin stocks"" now >>

2019-09-03 15:21:00,"CARACAS, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Venezuela's opposition leader Juan Guaido on Tuesday backed the use of satellites to help locate guerrilla groups that have crossed into Venezuela from neighboring Colombia, days after dissident rebels launched a new offensive.

Former FARC guerillas on Thursday announced a rearmament in a video that Colombian authorities believe was filmed in Venezuela, spurring concern of a worsening of the Colombian armed conflict and expansion of armed groups in Venezuela. 

""We are going to authorize the use of satellite technology to facilitate the location of these irregular groups, of camps within the country's borders,"" Guaido said in a televised presentation.

Guaido in January invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency after declaring President Nicolas Maduro's 2018 re-election a farce.

He has been recognized by more than 50 countries, including the United States and Colombia, as Venezuela's legitimate president, but does not control state institutions.

Colombian President Ivan Duque has promised to persecute the rebel group, whose leaders said they were returning to armed struggle because Duque had betrayed the 2016 peace accord that lead to the FARC's demobilization.

Venezuela's information ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Maduro in July said two former FARC leaders, whose whereabouts at the time where unknown, were welcome in Venezuela. The two later appeared in the video announcing rearmament.

The United States, which has launched a broad set of sanctions against Maduro's government in efforts to hasten his departure, says Venezuela's government provides a safe haven to Colombian rebel groups.

At Stock Options Channel  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MAR options chain for the new October 11th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.    The put contract at the $122.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.10. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $122.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $118.90 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MAR, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $123.83/share today. Because the $122.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 59%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.54% return on the cash commitment, or 24.41% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost  .  makeArticleAd();  Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Marriott International, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $122.00 strike is located relative to that history:       Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $125.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.50. If an investor was to purchase shares of MAR stock at the current price level of $123.83/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $125.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 3.77% if the stock gets called away at the October 11th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MAR shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Marriott International, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MAR's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $125.00 strike highlighted in red:    Considering the fact that the $125.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

HARARE, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Zimbabwean public sector doctors went on strike on Tuesday for the second time in less than a year to demand a further salary increase amid soaring living costs, as President Emmerson Mnangagwa's government struggles with a deteriorating economy.

Zimbabwe is mired in its worst economic crisis in a decade, with triple-digit inflation, rolling power cuts and shortages of U.S. dollars, basic goods, medicines and fuel that have revived memories of the hyperinflation that forced it to ditch its currency in 2009.

The main unions representing doctors and teachers, who make up the bulk of public service workers, said they had rejected the government's salary offers, which would see the lowest paid worker earning 1,023 Zimbabwe dollars ($90.45) a month.

The doctors accepted their 60% pay increase but said it was not sufficient to avert the strike action. The teachers are not currently on strike.

The doctors are looking for another 401% pay hike that they want indexed to the U.S. dollar.

""We met with the government representatives yesterday and they promised to expedite other allowances for health personnel but so far it has just been empty promises,"" the head of the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association (ZHDA), Peter Magombeyi, told Reuters.

""They have taken us for granted for too long, but we are ready to go back to work as soon as they offer us something tangible, which has not been forthcoming so far.""

""ASSESSING THE SITUATION""

At the turn of the year, junior doctors held a 40-day strike for better pay and conditions that crippled public hospitals. It ended without a deal being reached and with doctors threatening further stoppages.

Most junior doctors stayed away on Tuesday at the largest two public hospitals, Parirenyatwa and Harare Central, a Reuters witness said.

A few junior doctors turned up to work, but said they would not report for work on Wednesday. Some senior doctors also said they would join the strike on Wednesday.

""Today we were assessing the situation but we are not coming in tomorrow. The strike will be in full swing,"" a junior doctor at Harare Central Hospital told Reuters.

The Health Services Board (HSB), which represents the government, said in a statement late on Monday that it was surprised the doctors were taking strike action despite accepting the earlier pay offer.

ZHDA wants wages, which were previously pegged to the U.S. dollar, to be paid at the prevailing inter-bank market rate and says its members can no longer afford to report for duty due to surging inflation and the deterioration in the economy.

Their current salaries are worth less than 10% of what they were before the peg was scrapped due to high inflation.

On Tuesday, the Zimbabwe dollar traded at 11.31 against the U.S. dollar in the interbank market and 13.10 in the black market. Both rates are used to buy goods.

Aurora Cannabis (NYSE: ACB ) has a well-defined path to profitability. Its near-term goal is to drive down costs by leveraging its massive scale to improve margins. Its medium-term goal is to leverage R&D to work on higher-margin products and to harvest the Canadian cash flow that is generated from its near-term goals. Long-term, the goal is to use extensive R&D to develop and brand higher-margin products.

Wall Street likes ACB stock. Out of the 17 firms that follow it, 10 of them have it ranked either as a buy or overweight. The average target price is more than two times higher than where it is currently trading.

In addition, unlike many of the other large industrial growers, this company reported an actual profit last year, something that is rarely seen in this industry. In fiscal 2019, the company earned 15 cents a share.

Despite all of these positives, the price of ACB stock continues to decline. Why is this happening? Being a veteran of the markets I know that it is impossible to give an exact and definitive reason.

But I believe that a challenge facing Aurora Cannabis and other cannabis growing companies which isn't discussed too often is the negative effect that the supply from the black market has on their sales.

If you follow the cannabis markets you are probably aware that two recent stories involve litigation issues other than legalization. Canntrust (NYSE: CTST ) is alleged to have operated unlicensed, and therefore untaxed and illegal, grow rooms. These were literally hidden behind fake walls.

In addition, the FBI just announced that it will be investigating the industry. Sources tell me that their main focus will be on the alleged kickbacks that are required in some places in order to obtain a growing license. I believe that their investigation will expose and shed light on the enormous size of the black market of cannabis.

Is the cannabis black market efficient and profitable? You bet it is. As someone who has many connections in law enforcement and the cannabis industry, I can tell you that the black market for recreational cannabis is enormous. And this market is virtually, if not literally, impossible to control.

Consider a cannabis farm of 2,000 acres. You don't need a vivid imagination to understand how easy it will be for employees and others to walk off with product or to send it out the proverbial back door. In fact, I have talked to recreational marijuana enthusiasts in Canada that enjoy it daily. Yet none have purchased it from a licensed retailer since it became legal almost a year ago.  Why go to the store when someone in the park across the street has the same thing for half the price?

As long as these dynamics exist, industrial growers like Aurora Cannabis will have to accept and face this challenge as part of their growth strategies.

ACB stock has been trending lower since it failed at resistance at the $7 level in early August. If it continues to trend lower, there may be support around the $5 level. This is where support was in December and January and it is also important psychologically.

At the time of this writing, Mark Putrino did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-03 09:45:00,"DAR ES SALAAM, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Opposition lawmakers in Tanzania on Tuesday boycotted the swearing in of a ruling party lawmaker who replaced a fierce critic of the president following his expulsion from parliament.

Tundu Lissu, who survived an assassination attempt in September 2017 when he was shot 16 times by unknown gunmen, was dismissed from parliament in June over absenteeism and ethical issues.

Parliamentary chief whip of the main opposition party CHADEMA, Lissu was initially treated for his wounds in Kenya but since January 2018 has been recuperating in Belgium. 

A vocal opponent of President John Magufuli, Lissu was arrested on several occasions and charged with incitement before the gun attack in broad daylight in 2017.

A former British colony of 57 million people, Tanzania has long been regarded as one of Africa's most stable democracies.

But critics accuse Magufuli's government of cracking down on dissent. His administration has suspended some newspapers, arrested opposition leaders and restricted political rallies. The government has rejected the criticism.

Lissu's expulsion could further weaken the opposition's voice in parliament, where the ruling party enjoys a commanding majority with about 75 percent of all seats, analysts say.

""How could we be part of the oath while Lissu has been unfairly expelled from parliament? Everybody knows that he is currently still receiving medical treatment,"" opposition MP Esther Bulaya, who joined other CHADEMA lawmakers to boycott the brief swearing-in ceremony of the new ruling party member of parliament, told Reuters.

""It's very cruel ... this raises questions if authorities are really interested in having a multi-party democracy in place in our country,"" Bulaya said by phone from Tanzania's capital Dodoma where the national assembly meets.

National assembly speaker Job Ndugai has defended the decision to remove Lissu from his seat, saying he breached parliamentary procedures.

Lissu has filed a case in Tanzania's commercial capital Dar es Salaam to challenge his expulsion.

His lawyers lost a bid on Monday for a court injunction to block the swearing in of the ruling party MP who took his former seat, but the court is expected to rule next week over the legality of his expulsion.

Magufuli condemned Lissu's attempted assassination in 2017 and called for a swift investigation. No suspects have been arrested. Local media reported that Lissu vowed to return to Tanzania this week to resume his political activities.

Some analysts see Lissu as a possible front-runner to become the main opposition presidential candidate in next year's general election to challenge Magufuli's bid for a second and final term in office.",Tanzania lawmakers protest against expulsion from parliament of critic of president - Nasdaq.com,https://www.nasdaq.com/article/tanzania-lawmakers-protest-against-expulsion-from-parliament-of-critic-of-president-20190903-00825

The transaction will likely be funded using existing internal resources. Moreover, it is expected to have a minimal impact on Lloyds' capital.    Notably, under Tesco Bank's ownership, the portfolio generated income of nearly £81 million and pre-tax profit of £9 million in the year ending Feb 28, 2019.    The beneficial ownership of the portfolio is expected to be transferred by September-end. However, the legal title is projected to be transferred by the end of March 2020.

Moreover, it is expected that once the portfolio is acquired, it will generate returns in excess of current organic market opportunities for Lloyds. As a result of the acquisition, it will get more flexibility in participating within the mortgage market.    Notably, once the transaction is complete, Lloyds expects its open mortgage book assets in 2019 to be ahead of 2018.

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.

2019-09-03 08:59:44,"It’s no question that the gaming industry is taking off. According to Newzoo, the global games market is expected to grow from $137.9 billion in 2018 to $180.1 billion in 2021.

With that in mind, investors are looking to capitalize on opportunities within this constantly evolving space. When looking for the most compelling investments in this industry, analysts tell investors that 3 gaming stocks look especially poised to outperform.

Let’s take a closer look at these 3 fast-growing gaming stocks.   

Glu Mobile develops and publishes mobile games specifically for smartphones and tablets. Given the fact that shares are down 45% year-to-date, some analysts argue this gaming stock is undervalued.

The company’s second quarter earnings results seem to support this argument. On August 1, GLUU reported that it generated $101.9 million worth of bookings, the largest in its history. It also saw its sixth consecutive quarter of adjusted EBITDA profitability as well as launched two new games including WWE Universe and Diner Dash Adventures.

Adding to the good news, GLUU has made significant efforts to expand its user base to include female gamers who are typically underrepresented. It released the Design Home and the Kendall and Kylie game back in 2016, with the company stating that several more games for this target audience are in development.

One analyst points out that GLUU’s strategy of focusing more on games they fully own rather than celebrity licensed properties will pay off in the long-term.

“We believe there are multiple potential positive catalysts for the stock in 2020,” Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter stated. As a result, he reiterated his Buy rating and lowered the price target from $9 to $8 on August 2. The three-star analyst notes that the current share price of $4.44 presents a buying opportunity as he sees 80% upside potential for the stock.

All in all, the rest of the Street remains bullish on GLUU. It boasts a ‘Strong Buy’ analyst consensus and a $9 average price target, suggesting 92% upside potential.

The next gaming stock on our list has also had a bit of a rough going since its May 3 IPO. That being said, the online casino game company still offers investors plenty of upside potential.

Some analysts are picking SciPlay based on the results from its latest quarter. The company announced on August 1 that Q2 revenue reached $118.1 million, up 18% year-over-year which was more than double the market growth rate according to estimates from Eilers and Krejcik. It doesn’t hurt that profits and cash flow also gained year-over-year.

Management attributes this growth to its strong product offerings. Its largest game in terms of revenue, Jackpot Party, performed well with over 28% year-over-year growth. Adding to the good news, three of SCPL’s games are ranked in the top 30 in the Social Casino Category on Apple’s App Store, and six games are ranked in the top 30 on Google Play for Top Grossing Casino Games.

The company has also placed a substantial focus on analytics in an attempt to drive margin improvement.

 All of these factors as well as several secular tailwinds in mobile gaming, digital gaming and online gambling should benefit SCPL according to five-star analyst Drew Crum. On August 5, the Stifel Nicolaus analyst reiterated his Buy rating while slightly lowering the price target from $18.50 to $17. Even with the price target cut, Crum believes shares could surge 79% in the next twelve months.

Wall Street appears to mirror the analyst’s sentiment. SCPL has a ‘Strong Buy’ analyst consensus and an $18 average price target, implying 85% upside potential.

Investors like the last gaming stock on our list based on the fact that it isn’t solely relying its past hits such as Assassin’s Creed or Rainbow Six Siege.

The company has tried to avoid ending up in a rut by expanding its game lineup. UBSFY announced that it would be releasing a light-hearted Greek mythology adventure game, Gods & Monsters, at the beginning of next year.

“We cherish our fans that are following our brands like Assassin’s Creed or Ghost Recon going forward. But we feel that it’s also a good moment now to invest into new IPs,” Ubisoft EMEA manager Alain Corre said.

More good news came on June 11 when the company unveiled its Uplay+ game subscription service for PC and Stadia starting at $15 per month. The platform will be released on September 3 and will include access to over 100 games, including the premium versions of the latest releases and their associated add-ons as well as the option for users to be included in every beta and early access program.

All of these positive developments played into KeyBanc analyst Tyler Parker’s decision to resume his coverage of UBSFY with a Buy rating and a €94 price target on July 29.

The rest of Wall Street is on the same page. With 2 Buy ratings vs no Holds or Sells received over the last three months, UBSFY boasts a ‘Moderate Buy’ analyst consensus.

2019-09-03 09:22:00,"By Andrea Shalal and Makini Brice

WASHINGTON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday warned he would be ""tougher"" on Beijing in a second term if trade talks dragged on, compounding market fears that ongoing trade disputes between the United States and China could trigger a U.S. recession.

The world's two largest economies imposed fresh tariffs on each other on Sunday, ratcheting up a tit-for-tat tariff war that has unsettled financial markets and raised the specter of a global recession. U.S. and Chinese negotiators are due to meet in person in Washington this month, but no date has yet been set. 

Trump, ignoring recent negative U.S. economic data, said in a posting on Twitter that the United States was ""doing very well in our negotiations with China,"" and played up the damage U.S. tariffs were doing to the Chinese economy.

He warned that Beijing faced even tougher terms if the two sides did not resolve their trade dispute and he won re-election in November 2020, writing, ""Deal would get MUCH TOUGHER! In the meantime, China's Supply Chain will crumble and businesses, jobs and money will be gone!""

He did not provide details about the negotiations or how they could become tougher.

Thomas Donohue, chief executive of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, told CNBC that U.S. companies and workers were bearing the brunt of the U.S. tariffs but China's economy was also hurting.

He urged Trump to postpone the new tariffs that went into effect to give both sides time to reach an agreement.

Congressional passage of the U.S-Mexico-Canada (USCMA) trade agreement was possible, and would help boost the U.S. economy while reassuring financial markets, he said. ""It would rub off on what we're doing in China.""

Trump, a Republican, has often publicly repeated his belief that Beijing is trying to slow-walk trade negotiations in the hopes a victory by a Democratic presidential candidate in 2020 may lead to better terms in an agreement.

Washington began imposing 15% tariffs on an array of Chinese imports on Sunday, while China began placing new duties on U.S. crude oil. 

China has since lodged a complaint against the United States at the World Trade Organization over U.S. import duties, its third lawsuit challenging Trump's China-specific tariffs. 

Chinese Vice Premier Liu He said earlier on Tuesday that China vehemently opposes a trade war. ",Trump warns China against dragging its feet in trade talks - Nasdaq.com,https://www.nasdaq.com/article/trump-warns-china-against-dragging-its-feet-in-trade-talks-20190903-00778

ISTANBUL/NEW YORK, Sept 3 (Reuters) - U.S. online streaming service Netflix  has applied for a license to continue operating in Turkey under new online broadcasting rules that have raised fears over possible censorship in the future.

Turkey last month granted its radio and television watchdog sweeping oversight over all online content, including streaming platforms and news outlets, a move that raised concerns that the state was tightening its control over the media. 

As part of obtaining the license, the Los Gatos, California-based subscription streaming service will set up a local entity and pay 0.5% of revenue generated in Turkey to the government. The company said it is in discussions to pay similar levies in Spain and Italy.

Netflix serves 1.5 million subscribers in Turkey and only reaches about 10% of the country's broadband households, the company said, making the Turkish market a potentially important and lucrative source of new subscribers as competition mounts.

The company operates one of the world's largest streaming services and has sustained its position at the top by courting new subscribers outside the United States as its U.S. home market matures.

To date, Turkey has not attempted to censor Netflix content, a source familiar with the matter said.

Turkey's new regulation stipulates that content providers should get a fresh license to continue operating in Turkey, and comply with RTUK guidelines.

If they don't respect the guidelines, they will be given 30 days to change their content, or face having their licenses suspended for three months and later canceled. The announcement last month did not specify what standards RTUK would expect.

Critics have said the move will allow the government to tighten its grip on Turkish media, which is largely owned or controlled by supporters of President Tayyip Erdogan and his ruling AK Party. 

GROWTH MARKET

Netflix and the Saudi Arabian government were widely condemned when the company pulled an episode of the comedy show, ""Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj"" from its Saudi Arabia service in January, after officials complained. The show was critical of Saudi Arabia after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. 

Unlike other popular internet-based content providers and services, including Alphabet Inc'sYouTube and Twitter Inc , which were banned at one time in Turkey, Netflix is generally not a platform for news or current affairs.

Netflix is hoping a proactive approach to working with local regulators, such as by bolstering parental controls, would help it address potential censorship issues down the line, the source said.

""Our goal is to protect children from content that may be inappropriate for their age, while ensuring our members can continue to watch the shows and films of their choice,"" a Netflix spokesman said on Monday.

Netflix declined to comment about potential censorship concerns beyond its statement.

In the quarter ended June 30, it lost subscribers in the United States for the first time in eight years and fell short of targets for new subscriber growth overseas. Netflix executives said it would still meet its annual target.

In Turkey, it has invested in local programming and some of its TV series have attracted international audiences, including ""The Protector,"" about an Istanbul shopkeeper who battles immortal enemies.

Netflix has ordered two seasons of ""The Gift"" - another Turkish supernatural drama - and has commissioned the Turkish series, ""Love 101.""

Shares of Netflix were down 1% to $290.86 on Nasdaq. ",Netflix applies for licence under new Turkish broadcasting rules - Nasdaq.com,https://www.nasdaq.com/article/netflix-applies-for-licence-under-new-turkish-broadcasting-rules-20190903-00329

So one thing is very obvious about Trump's tweets-they can     move markets. However, what is less well-known is that their     frequency also has an effect on indexes. So how do markets fare     on days when Trump is hammering out tweet after tweet versus     days when he only pens a few? The answer is that more is worse.     On days where Trump write 35 tweets or more there is a 9 basis     point drag on markets versus days where he tweets 5 times or     less, where there is a 5 basis point tailwind.

 FINSUM      :     There is not much one can do with this info, but it is an     interesting data point. How long before a new ""smart beta""     product comes out focused on this? Haha.

Sept 3 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday as datashowed factory activity contracted for the first time since 2016in August, renewing fears that a drawn-out trade war between theUnited States and China could tip the world's largest economyinto recession.    

The Institute for Supply Management said its index ofnational factory activity decreased to 49.1, compared with areading of 51.1 estimated by analysts polled by Reuters. urn:newsml:reuters.com:*:nL2N25R073

""It looks like the market is betting on a yes in the online ballot of 5-Star members,"" said Luca Cazzulani, rates strategist at UniCredit.  ""We are a bit more cautious and if there is a no vote the market will be caught off guard.""

Italian yields extended falls after a Reuters report that European Central Bank policymakers are leaning towards a stimulus package that includes a rate cut, a beefed-up pledge to keep rates low for longer and compensation for banks over the side-effects of negative rates. .

That pushed the gap over safer German Bund yields to around 157 bps , its tightest since May 2018.

The Italian bond market was further supported when 5-Star and the PD unveiled a shared policy programme on Tuesday to serve as the basis of a new coalition, putting an expansionary 2020 budget at the top of their agenda, but promising that it would not endanger public finances. 

Even heightened Brexit uncertainty and weak stock markets failed to dent demand for Italian bonds, which tend to move with other risk assets, thanks to reduced political uncertainty in Italy and heightened expectations for rate cuts and stimulus at next week's ECB meeting.

Britain's lawmakers will decide on Tuesday whether to move one step closer to an early election when they vote on the first stage of their plan to block Prime Minister Boris Johnson from pursuing a no-deal Brexit. 

UK 10-year gilt yields fell to a record low of 0.34% , helping push Germany's benchmark 10-year bond yield  to a fresh record low at -0.74%.

""Bund yields are being pulled lower by UK yields this week… as the UK is inching towards possible snap elections and [on uncertainty of] when such a possible election would be,"" said KBC strategist Mathias van der Jeugt.

An industry report showing the U.S. manufacturing sector contracted in August for the first time since 2016 also pushed yields lower, with U.S. Treasury yields down sharply .

Meanwhile, Austria's 10-year bond yield fell to a record low of -0.48%  after the country sold 1 billion euros of five and 10-year bonds. .

Both bonds received orders of about 1.8-times the amounts sold, despite offering average yields of -0.798% and -0.494% respectively.","Italian, German bond yields tumble to fresh record lows - Nasdaq.com",https://www.nasdaq.com/article/italian-german-bond-yields-tumble-to-fresh-record-lows-20190903-00219
2019-09-03 13:46:44,"Legendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.    In trading on Tuesday, shares of Embraer SA (Symbol: ERJ) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 29.9, after changing hands as low as $17.04 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF ( SPY  ) is 48.1. A bullish investor could look at ERJ's 29.9 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. The chart below shows the one year performance of ERJ shares:     Looking at the chart above, ERJ's low point in its 52 week range is $16.73 per share, with $23.68 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $17.11.  makeArticleAd();   Find out what 9 other oversold stocks you need to   know about »

2019-09-03 11:09:00,"KRYNICA ZDROJ, Poland, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Poland's biggest oil refiner PKN Orlen  signalled on Tuesday that it could offer to swap assets with competitors in order to ease EU regulators' concerns about its planned merger with rival Lotos .

PKN's Chief Executive Daniel Obajtek said the state-run company plans to submit a paper to the European Commission this month offering steps it may take in order to convince Brussels to approve the merger with Lotos.

Obajtek was asked during a news conference whether his company will be forced to sell some assets in order to secure the Commission's approval. He suggested that an asset swap could be possible with its competitors.

After the news conference a source close to PKN Orlen said PKN was conducting talks with its competitors that may in the end conclude with asset swaps, for example, with regards to petrol stations or its wholesale business.

The source did not say which assets may be subject to the potential swaps.

Earlier on Tuesday, BP's  head for Europe said BP might be interested in taking over PKN's assets if they are put up for sale as a condition of the merger approval process. 

PKN, which has a market capitalization of 39 billion zlotys ($9.9 billion) said last year that it planned to buy at least a 53% stake in Lotos, which is valued at 16.14 billion zlotys, from the government.

It has formally requested approval from EU regulators for the deal to go ahead. Sources have said that due to competition concerns PKN will likely face long and difficult talks with the European Commission.",PKN hints it could offer asset swap with competitors to ease Lotos merger - Nasdaq.com,https://www.nasdaq.com/article/pkn-hints-it-could-offer-asset-swap-with-competitors-to-ease-lotos-merger-20190903-01330

LONDON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - A credit-fuelled stimulus splurge could hurt China's credit rating more than the immediate hit from U.S. trade tariffs, S&P Global's main analyst for the country says.

S&P last cut China's rating a couple of years ago, but it has been almost a year since its last formal review of the world's number two economy and a lot has happened since.

Beijing has been trying to offset the damage with various forms of stimulus, but S&P's primary sovereign analyst for China, Kim Eng Tan, said there was a risk it ends up going too far with the efforts.

""If we have an abrupt shock of some sort then I think the government might start running for the more immediate kinds of economic support,"" Tan said.

""That in our view will mean the banks will have to start lending quite quickly and that would be negative for the government's rating.""

S&P currently rates China at A+ with a stable outlook. That is the same as both Moody's and Fitch. But it can often be the first of the three main agencies to move which means its imminent review will be closely watched.

Tan gave no hint of whether a change might be coming. Much depends how much the credit metrics weaken and anyway China's financial system has ample liquidity, so it is unlikely a deterioration would be so bad a straight out cut is needed.

""I would expect that we would typically flag it with a negative outlook before we changed the rating,"" Tan said.

One reason why the Chinese government may revert to pushing banks to ramp up lending again would be if there was a sharp rise in job losses, which then had the potential to cause domestic angst.

It is all of course interlinked with the U.S. trade rift, though. Two years ago no one expected the situation to reach such an extreme level. Things aren't going to suddenly improve,  Eng acknowledged, but at the same time, more tariffs are not the big risk for China's rating.

Total exports - services plus goods - out of China account for less than 20 percent of GDP, S&P estimates. The United States is only around half of that.

""I would not expect U.S. tariffs by themselves to cause the Chinese economy to weaken so much that we have to lower the rating"".

""The overall impact will not be so big that China cannot stabilise itself. The question is how they stabilise and that goes back to my first comment - if they use credit then the risks are higher for the rating,"" Tan said.",China stimulus splurge would hurt rating - Nasdaq.com,https://www.nasdaq.com/article/china-stimulus-splurge-would-hurt-rating-20190903-00933

General Motors (NYSE: GM ) has seen off, for now, the danger of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) overtaking it as America's most valuable car company.

 But GM stock and the company's financial results have barely budged since Mary Barra became CEO five years ago. The company also faces a host of new problems, including a president who seems determined to hammer it with misinformation.

The latest tweets calling GM America's smallest car company , claiming its workforce is smaller than that of Ford Motor (NYSE: F ) or Fiat Chrysler (NASDAQ: FCAU ), are just wrong. Even journalists who printed the facts misrepresented the reality .

That doesn't help as the company enters union contract negotiations. The current contract expires Sept. 14, and the United Auto Workers will be under pressure to be tough, facing their own corruption probe .

What's clear is that GM is at risk of becoming yet-another victim of the trade war as well as the president's continuing tweet war.

China is now GM's largest market. GM has 11 joint ventures in China, two subsidiaries, 58,000 employees and had 3.64 million sales there in 2018. In North America, by contrast, its sales were 3.5 million vehicles. It's not flooding the U.S. market with Chinese-made cars, but it is producing them where they're sold.

China is also closer to fast-growing markets in India and Southeast Asia than Detroit is. Situating production near those markets makes financial sense. But it does mean GM now has more total workers in China than it has union workers in the U.S., of which it has about 46,000. Reporting on this fact is almost certain to hurt contract talks , which could easily lead to a strike.

This isn't the only area where Trump is getting in GM's way. He's also angry that the industry is going along with California's efforts to rein-in car pollution, ignoring an administration waiver on mileage standards. Growing fleets of hybrid and all-electric cars, like the Chevy Bolt , mean they can meet tougher standards.

Even without Trump's piling-on, General Motors has enough problems to make investors want to shy away from it.

Over the last five years GM stock is up only 6.45%, while the average S&P stock is up 47%. It can still afford the 38 cents per share dividend, as it has averaged $1.57 per share of earnings over the last four quarters. The company's operating cash flow remains strong, at over $15 billion in 2018 and over $5 billion in just the last quarter.

But the company's debt load has more than doubled under Barra, and while the dividend does yield 4.1% to current investors, at a time when the U.S. 30-year bond trades at under 2%, it has barely budged in five years. The dividend hasn't been raised since the end of 2015.

While the price earnings multiple of 5.86 looks attractive, and the yield will make the average retiree smile, GM stock has barely budged since it returned to the public market in 2011. It lives, but it's going nowhere fast.

GM is a dividend stock you buy for income. GM can afford the dividend payout.

But General Motors is facing many problems. It faces the turn toward all-electric and self-driving vehicles, a government that is doing it no favors, and a tough labor negotiation.

Like other U.S. car makers, GM has practically abandoned the car market in favor of pick-up trucks and sport utility vehicles. It faces a challenging pricing environment and pressure on commodity costs.

GM is the kind of great old American company, like General Electric (NYSE: GE ), that I like to root for. But it's not the kind of company I like to invest in.

What happens starting January is, in California, they had passed the CCPA, the California Consumer Privacy Act. There's a lot of conversation as all companies now have to deal first with GDPR over in Europe, now with the CCPA in California. So what I'm really watching is the continued conversation around the regulatory environment, the antitrust environment, what is happening from the likes of Facebook , Amazon , Apple, Alphabet , Google, how these companies continue to manage a landscape when congressional investigations and regulatory bodies continue to come after them. So, ahead of the launching and the CCPA going into effect in January, I'm kind of watching how these companies continue to evolve this landscape.

Hill: You think it's possible any of the politicians on either side of the political aisle running for president in 2020 might take some shots at big tech over the next 12 to 18 months?

Cross: [laughs] The next 12 to 18 months, Chris, is going to be just fascinating to watch from the political landscape. Even over the next few months ahead of January, I'm watching to see how these companies -- they're going to spend a lot of dollars lobbying, but just, how they continue to talk about privacy and regulatory issues from the big picture for them.

Hill:  Jason Moser, what about you?

Jason Moser: You mentioned Disney's streaming service. That's one of the things I'm excited to watch. No. 1, as time goes on here, we're learning more about what Disney+ is going to be, what it's going to offer. We were talking about this before taping, it really does seem like they have a lot of stuff for every age group, from babies to teenagers to adults like us. I think it was really fascinating to see at the D23 conference they had here recently where they were starting to talk about all the different stuff that Disney as a company is doing. And they pulled back the curtain a little bit on this streaming service. Announced a lot of the content. It was impressive to me. Somebody on the management team, somebody on the executive team, had the wherewithal to say, ""You know what? Let's go ahead and take pre sign ups because people are going to be really enthusiastic about this content right as we show it all to them. We'll get people to go ahead and sign up for this thing early."" Remember, it doesn't launch until November 12th. At $6.99, that's a great deal. $6.99 a month. It's really hard to argue with that. They're going to bundle it, of course, with ESPN+ and Hulu ad supported product for people who want more than just the Disney+.

But it's also worth noting, they have a deal out there, buy two years, get the third year free. It's kind of like Mac and Costco , right? You're doing yourself a disservice if you don't subscribe at this point. They're setting themselves up to have even more pricing power through this. I think it's going to be just fascinating to watch how this plays out over the rest of the streaming landscape in the coming years.

Hill: Also, you think about the ripple effects to the other big players in the video streaming space. Presumably we're going to get more information from Apple about Apple+. And let's not forget Comcast looming out there. Heading into 2020, they say they're on track to launch NBC Universal's streaming service as well. And, of course, a little company called Netflix.

Moser: Little company called Netflix. I mean, I think all of these possibles, these potentials, they are just that. At this point, I think it's going to be really fascinating to see how this plays out on Netflix, just because they're going to lose so much content so quickly. And not only are they losing that content, but they're really losing the potential for that future content as well. Again, I feel like Netflix is one of those staples that a lot of people will continue to subscribe to. I just wonder how much more they're going to be able to raise prices given the content wars.

Hill: It seems like, the last few months of the year, there's more noise for investors than there is at any other time during the year. Particularly as we head into the fall, Andy, you get more people beating the drum for a potential recession. As we mentioned, the presidential primaries are heating up. There's going to be a lot of noise. That makes it easier for investors to miss things. What is something you want to highlight and encourage investors not to miss?

Cross: I put this out on Twitter , there's always been a wall of worry that the media loves to talk about. And certainly, we have issues that are real. Brexit, the U.K. may leave the EU without a deal. We have an inverted yield curve, which historically has implied that maybe we'll have recessions on the way. We have earnings growth that's only going to be about 2% to 3% for the S&P 500 companies this year. So it's not like things are completely cheery. And Chris, you mentioned the political environment. But I think it's really important for investors to maintain and think about their perspective. We are long-term investors. When you receive these kinds of concerns, you have to understand, if I can't stomach the volatility, maybe I should have a little bit more cash on the sidelines. Really understanding your investing mentality. If you're investing, like I am for my daughter's education, which is 10-plus years away, that's a lot of time to be able to compound returns. The blips of the volatility we may see, not as much of a worry. But I think it's really important for investors to understand their mindset, and really focus on their goals, and then invest accordingly.

Hill: Jason, what about you?

Moser: A little bit in line with what Andy was talking about there at the beginning of the show. We're coming into a very polarizing election cycle here in 2020. I would encourage investors not to miss the forest for the trees. What I mean by that is, as with every election season, we're going to see a lot of political posturing. We're going to see a lot of promises made with the hope that those promises maybe will get the people making those promises elected. We all know, generally speaking, it's really tough to actually uphold those promises because you can't just call the shots yourself. We live in a democracy, after all. But we do see a lot of posturing. I think that what that can do, No. 1, it can create some fear. I think we're hearing a lot about how antitrust concerns play out with companies like Alphabet and Amazon and Microsoft and Facebook and Apple. I personally think that politicians are missing the point there with antitrust concerns. I think probably more along the privacy line, like you were talking about there, Andy. But I think that this creates opportunities, potentially, over the coming year and beyond. When you see all this political posturing, the headlines that go on, the market reacts to this stuff day after day. That volatility certainly can create some windows. I would encourage investors to keep a focus on the forest, not the trees. Keep some money ready, because there'll be some opportunities out there.

Hill: Alright, before we head into the break, one business prediction. It can be about a company, an industry, a CEO. Give me something, Andy!

Cross: I think we may see Berkshire Hathaway make an acquisition. We talked about this in April. We all tossed out some ideas there. I said Sherwin-Williams . That might be a little bit too big. He owns Southwest . Maybe it could be Moody's . Maybe Travelers . I think, as stocks maybe go through this volatile period Jason just mentioned, with interest rates continuing to fall, and they probably will fall, it looks like, I think we might see Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway put some of that massive cash they have on the balance sheet to work.

Hill: We talk about having a watch list of stocks for when we have a little bit of cash and opportunity arises. Safe to assume Warren Buffett also has his own watch list?

Cross: Oh, yeah, he does. It's very valuation-centric. That's why I was looking at Travelers. $40 billion market cap, sells at 1.8X book, and Berkshire already owns 2.3% of it.

Moser: Or McCormick !

Cross: [laughs] Of course, McCormick.

Hill: [laughs] Do you own a little bit of Travelers stock? You worked there once upon a time.

Moser: I do not anymore, no. I used to. I did work there for a spell, though, about a year before I came up here. Very good business. Well-run insurer.

Hill: Give me one prediction.

Moser: Crypto bulls, don't take this the wrong way... I think that Facebook's Libra initiative, at the very least, will be put on hold. But really, I think Facebook's Libra initiative as we know it today is going to be dead in the water. I just don't give this thing a chance in its current form. There are too many regulatory concerns to begin with, but we're already seeing some of the partners that are signing up for this express some concern. Some of the partners are talking about backing out. All it takes is a couple for the rest to fall in line. Ultimately, when you look at the problem that Facebook is trying to solve -- or at least the problem they say they're trying to solve --bringing more services to the unbanked and underbanked, listen, that's admirable, but inventing a new currency ain't the solution, Chris. I think they need to go back to the drawing board. I just don't understand how this moves forward.

Hill: Our email address is radio@fool.com , for any crypto bulls who want to send a note. We'll be sure to forward it to Jason. 2019, safe to say it's been a hot one for IPOs. Jason, I'll start with you. Is there a private company out there that you'd like to see make the leap to the public markets?

Moser: Chris, there is, and it's not Chick-fil-A, believe it or not. As you know, I head up our augmented reality service here at The Motley Fool. One company I really would love to be able to get in there is Niantic. Niantic is the creator of Pokémon Go . Perhaps you've heard of it. Their follow-up hit with Harry Potter: Wizards Unite . Maybe not as big of a hit as Pokémon Go . But still, the technology is pretty sound. Niantic used to be a part of Google, actually. Google spun that out on its own. Google still owns a little piece of it, maybe around 6% of it. There is talk of Niantic going public. Earlier in the year, they raised some more money to about a $4 billion valuation. A company that's doing a lot of neat things with augmented reality and gaming technology. I suspect we will see them go public, and I suspect I will have them on my watch list in short order.

Hill: Andy, what about you?

Cross:  Chris, I'm building off the Peloton S-1. They just filed sometime this week. I'm looking at Strava. It's an online fitness tracker. You may use Strava, Chris. I know you're a runner. Strava mean strive in Swedish. It has 42 million users. It adds one million users a month. I don't think they have any site to go public, but it's a really sticky service if you like to track your fitness online. It's very scalable. It has a community of users. 80% of the user base is outside the United States. It's a business that I use a lot. It's one that I would love to see get a little bit more funding behind them. The last valuation was about $400 million, so it's not a small company, but still not a huge one, either.

Hill: We don't have an exact date on when WeWork is going public, but that all the reporting is, they're targeting an IPO in September. Which one of the three of us is bringing the popcorn for that? Am I the only one who thinks that's going to be a memorable IPO, either for good reasons or for bad?

Moser: I think we all need to bring the popcorn. It'll probably be very, very entertaining.

Hill: One of the things we talk about with stocks is the whole concept of leash -- how long a leash are you going to give a stock in your portfolio? Jason, what's a stock you think, whether you own it or not, needs to be on a short leash right now?

Moser: I'll preface this by, going back to a year ago, my leash stock on our fall preview show was Chipotle . Fast forward to today, it's up about 100%. You're welcome, investors. This year's leash stock, I'm putting Tesla on a short leash. A couple of reasons. If you look at the company's financials, just a snapshot of the company's financials, I have a hard time believing that even one person out of 100 would say, ""Oh, yeah, I want to invest in that."" Their financials look atrocious. They actually don't even have the operating income to cover their interest expense. That's a problem. The company's always resorting to this financial chicanery, more or less, to keep things going. So, why would people invest in it? Well, clearly, Elon Musk and his vision. And that's fine. I appreciate that. I applaud it. I like Musk. I think I've been very public in saying we need more people like him. But I do think that he needs to get things in order and prioritize what matters most to him. As we talk more about the potential for global recession, geopolitical risk that may come about, when we start looking at some of these companies and how they may perform in tougher economic times, Tesla is set up to have a very rough go of it if we run into a buzz saw here. So, I think investors need to keep a very close eye on it.

Hill: Andy, what about you?

Cross:  JMo, you're not the only one with a little bit of egg, or burrito, on his face. I was bullish on the bank stocks coming into this year. Obviously, with the interest rate environment we've seen, it's not been a place to go. I still think it's going to be a low interest rate environment. Now I think it's going to be a lower interest rate environment. That doesn't portend well for the bank stocks. Axos Financial , formerly Bank of Internet, which had done so well helping grow online banking as a small bank -- it's a $2 billion bank. I just think this one is going to struggle because so many of the big banks now are continuing to invest in online banking. Goldman is hiring more techies than they are bankers these days. With a low interest rate environment, different environment than when they were growing their business, and one of the first ones out there, Axos Financial... I just don't think it's going to be a long-term winner from here.

Hill: I'll just add, as a group, the general sports retailers -- not the individual ones. I'm certainly not talking about Nike and their individual stores; or even for that matter, a company like Columbia Sportswear , which has bricks and mortar locations selling their own stuff. You look back over the past five years, that stock has more than doubled. We talked about this recently on this show -- the more I look at the environment that Foot Locker , Dick's Sporting Goods , Hibbett , they're all operating in, I just think I would stay far away from them. It's not to say they're all going the way of Sports Authority, but it really looks like a tough environment for the general sports retailers.

Moser: It's difficult to come up with a compelling reason as to why they should prosper.

Hill: Before we wrap up, let's go to the flip side. What is a stock, Jason, that you are even more bullish on now than you were a year ago?

Moser: It's one that I own. It's one that I recently added more shares to my position. That's Etsy . Going through the most recent quarterly numbers for the second quarter, the company continues to do so many good things with its niche craft market audience. Active sellers on the platform grew to over 2.3 million. Active buyers, more than 42.7 million. Their network pushed through about $1.1 billion in gross merchandise sales for the quarter. If you look at those metrics, those core metrics over time, they have done nothing but go up and to the right. These guys are just doing a lot of great things. And they're bringing it down the bottom line. It's a profitable company. They make a healthy amount of cash flow there. Josh Silverman, the CEO, has been there for just a little over two years. He's just done some tremendous things. I like his thinking about leadership and about the team that he assembles there at Etsy, and the retail market writ large, and how he shapes his team in regard to that view there. You look at the things that they're doing. They've got some catalysts on the horizon with a free shipping initiative they're introducing, a new unified platform called Etsy Ads, and they just wrapped up this acquisition of a company called Reverb, which is essentially like Etsy, but it's for musical instruments. That adds another unique dynamic to that network that they didn't have before. I think there's just a lot to look forward to with this company.

Hill: Andy Cross, what about you?

Cross: I still like The Trade Desk , TTD. It's a $10 billion market cap, leader in helping big clients place ads online in the non-walled-gardens. So, not Facebook, not Alphabet. But, if you are a client who is looking to place ads online and more and more into connected TV, Chris, as we continue to use things like Roku , Apple streaming, Fire Stick, The Trade Desk helps their clients reach more and more people in those newer environments. It's run by Jeff Green. He founded the company. He's built a wonderful culture, owns 9% of the business. It continues to grow at 40% to 50% a year. As I look at the market and the market evolving online, and these connected devices, as we are looking at different ways to embrace entertainment, I think advertising support is going to continue to be a place to go and to invest, and Trade Desk is making those investments, and it's doing well.

Hill: Interesting that these two companies operate in spaces that, on paper, you would think, ""Who would try to launch an advertising business?"" ""Who would try to launch a retailer when Amazon looms out there?"" Anyway. Interesting stuff.

[...]

Hill: David Henkes is a senior principal at Technomic, a global consulting firm for the food service industry. Recently, I got the chance to talk with David about a range of industry issues, including the rise of delivery, Chick-fil-A's success, trends to watch, and more. But I began our conversation by asking him about the current state of the restaurant business.

__

David Henkes: Based on traditional metrics that we would usually look at for the health of the industry -- things like consumer confidence, things like unemployment, things like disposable income -- all of those are extremely healthy right now. I think you could argue that some of those are from the best metrics we've seen in ages, in a long period of time. And yet the restaurant business, I would say, is challenged. It's certainly not in decline. People are still eating out, but it's not growing. We're essentially in a state where traffic -- and by traffic, I mean people's transactions, people visiting restaurants -- is essentially flat. The growth is coming primarily through price increases and/or mix change. By mix change, I mean adding higher-price, higher-margin items to the menu where consumers are spending more. So, most of the growth that's coming from the industry is really being driven by those two activities, by those two initiatives, price increases and mix change. So, what you fundamentally have is a business that's growing, or not growing, based on people coming in, and fundamentally, we worry about that, because the value equation is starting to get skewed and restaurants to the point where -- and this has been going on for some time -- the value for a family of four or five dining out is becoming unattainable. It's becoming so expensive that people aren't doing it. So, I think what you see is, people spend to a level. As prices go up in the restaurants, people are spending to that. What that means is, they're not increasing their frequency, they're not increasing their visits. So, the industry is growing. We have the entire restaurant industry pegged to grow about 4.4% in 2019 and about 4% in 2020. It's certainly not unhealthy, but, again, most of that growth is being driven by price increase, and some of the underlying fundamentals remain pretty challenged, much more challenged than we would expect, given how good the economy has been for the last couple of years.

Hill:  We talked about this recently on Motley Fool Money , the relative health of consumer spending in America right now. It's in good shape. If you're a retailer, it comes down to execution. There are certainly major retailers that are doing well. They're executing well both through e-commerce and in stores. And then you have others that just aren't getting it done. I'm thinking about the restaurant industry in similar ways. For restaurants that are executing at a high level, they're probably going to be better positioned than others. And I say all of that as a prelude to talk about delivery. It seems like delivery is now one of those things for restaurants that is table stakes. If you don't have a delivery strategy, then you're probably not going to survive the next 10 years. Is that reasonable?

Henkes: It is reasonable. Let me back up to your first point. I think execution is key, but I think what we've seen in restaurants is a dichotomy appear, where restaurants are meeting two different need states. One is the experiential need states, where places like independent restaurants excel. That's one reason chain sit down restaurants are struggling, is because they don't necessarily provide a unique, differentiated experience. So on the one hand, you've got this experiential factor, which is critical for that dining occasion. And then, the other need state that restaurants are really migrating toward is convenience. You really need to be executing at a high level in probably one of those areas. Fast food, McDonald's and the drive thru, and increasingly delivery, is going to meet that need state of convenience, food on demand. And then, people are still dining out and using their dining dollars as entertainment dollars. The more they sit in and watch Netflix at home, there's still a need to go out and socialize and see your friends, so dining becomes that entertainment dollar. And when you want to be entertained, you're not necessarily going to go to a non-differentiated chain restaurant, right? You're going to go to a local restaurant, you're going to go someplace that has a great drinks program, or is known for something, or where you're going to get something you can't normally get. That's the state of where we are. So, the execution that you referred to, I think, has to be looked at in either: are you executing on a unique point of difference? Or, are you executing against the convenience, given that consumers have what we would call hyper choice now?

There's so many food options available now, so, how do you appeal to hyper choice? Well, you need to be on the apps that they're using for food on demand -- Grubhub , Uber Eats, and Postmates, and all of those. And I would argue that the industry would be in an even bigger state of misery right now without delivery because delivery right now -- just to give you some stats on it, because we've been following delivery now for some time. Delivery overall is about a $40 billion business. It's about 7% of restaurant sales right now. That's overall delivery, both full service and limited service. It includes the Domino's drivers that deliver their own pizza, as well as Postmates, Uber Eats, Grubhub, and all of those. Third-party delivery in 2018 was about $10.2 billion. So if you put that in the context, and if you just said, ""In aggregate, delivery is $10 billion,"" if you assume that was one chain restaurant, that would be the fourth largest chain restaurant in the country. So, delivery has grown to such an extent that, you're right, it's table stakes. How you do it, and whether you have your own drivers or you're using one of these third-party delivery apps, is up for discussion, but it absolutely is critical. That's how consumers are behaving now. On that convenience-driven occasion that I talked about, delivery is increasingly the go-to solution for those consumers.

Hill: A few days ago, I saw a term in the restaurant industry that I'd never seen before. I'm hoping you can explain it for me. What is a ""ghost kitchen""?

Henkes: A ghost kitchen is essentially... there's a number of terms for it. Ghost kitchen, dark kitchen, headless restaurant. These all refer to essentially kitchens that are creating food for the delivery occasion. They do not have any kind of sit-down area at all. They only cater to delivery. What has happened to as delivery has grown, restauranteurs as well as the third-party providers have found, ""Perhaps we don't need all of these in-store seats. Perhaps we can make a living only by delivering food, not necessarily by having servers and waitstaff and all of this stuff."" It's hard to get a number around how many of them there are. It's not as big as you'd think. But they're certainly on the West Coast, and in places like New York, you have some of these, where they get set up, and essentially, the only real real estate they have is that space on the app. With all the growth in these third-party delivery services, none of them are making money right now.

Times are good, and people are willing to pay $12 for their McDonald's delivery. On a $6 meal, they're going to pay a lot more, but people have some extra money in their pocket and they're feeling good about it. But I have a sense that if and when a recession hits, these guys are going to get hit pretty hard. For anyone building a long-term strategy on a dark kitchen, ghost restaurant, whatever you want to call it, I think they've got to think twice about that, because I'm not sure that long-term, it's necessarily a solution. It's a great idea right now, but... we'll see how it plays out over the next three to five years.

Hill: Let's talk about a big restaurant. McDonald's franchisees came out earlier this year in a letter to company management and said loud and clear, ""We want you to prioritize a premium chicken sandwich."" This is aimed squarely at Chick-fil-A, which is not open on Sundays. The most recent things I've seen from McDonalds management were pretty lukewarm in terms of a response. You obviously cover the industry a lot more closely than I do. Is McDonald's working on this? And if they're not, should they be?

Henkes: The way I'll answer that is to say that everybody wants to be Chick-fil-A at this point. Chick-fil-A has executed beyond anyone's wildest imagination in terms of just their growth. They're now over a $10 billion chain. They grew almost 14% last year, and have been on this upward trajectory where they're doing a very high volume for a chain that, to your point, is not open on Sundays. So, to a large degree, is it about the chicken? Yeah, listen, Chick-fil-A does a great chicken sandwich. They use a pressure cooker, which is very hard to execute. It would be very hard for them to do that type of chicken in a McDonald's. The way Chick-fil-A does their chicken is a little bit different. But, listen, Chick-fil-A's success is not only driven by the chicken sandwich. It's driven by the overall excellence and the way they've structured their business. The owner-operators that they have, the fact that each owner typically only runs one restaurant. They don't have big franchisee groups like McDonald's or some of the other big chains. Most of the individual franchisees own one restaurant, and they do that intentionally to make sure that that owner-operator is focused solely on growing that business. The service and the hospitality that you get when you walk into a Chick-fil-A is second to none and is unique among quick service restaurants for doing that. So, yeah, listen, the chicken sandwich is great, and they obviously have a great product that people are clamoring for and that they line out the door for, but the secret to Chick-fil-A is not only in the product. It's in how they treat their employees and how they treat their guests. So, I think you can argue, yeah, we want to have a great chicken sandwich, but unless you're doing everything else that Chick-fil-A is doing, you can have the best chicken sandwich in the world, and it may help a little bit, but you're never going to replicate what Chick-fil-A has done unless you replicate the entire model. That's something that is very hard for McDonald's or any other quick service restaurant to do.

Hill: What is something on your radar right now that you think is going to be growing in the next couple of years? It could be an individual restaurant, it could be a restaurant concept. What should we be keeping our eyes on?

Henkes: There's a couple of things. As we give presentations, we talk about trends. I would say the two that are most of interest to people right now, people in the industry, would be plant-based proteins -- I referenced earlier the Impossible Whopper. People are not suddenly going vegan or vegetarian, but there is an overwhelming surge in demand for plant-based alternatives to meat. Whether it's because of meatless Mondays, whether it's because of sustainability and the perception that meat is harming the planet, there's a lot of things that go into it. You could argue it's health and wellness, although if you look at something like the Impossible Whopper, it actually has more calories and fat than the traditional Whopper does. Clearly, they're selling that not necessarily because of health, but because of other things. I would argue that plant-based proteins are something -- you could argue it's already here, but it's something that, we keep seeing more and more chains that are getting involved with that.

The other thing is what the impact of legalization of marijuana is going to have on the industry. That's true not only in the context of how it impacts consumer visits, but also what it's doing to the menu. A lot of interest in CBD as an ingredient within different menu items, whether it's beverages, cocktails, whether its food items. Now, there's still some federal legislative issues that need to be handled before most big manufacturers start throwing their hat into this ring. But, marijuana's legal up in Canada, and it's legalized in a number of states, so I think that's something that the industry is starting to try and figure out. What is going on with this, and how do we take advantage of that?

So, at least from a product category perspective, those are two big things. Delivery and off-premise are things that we keep hearing about. Those are the three big things that are probably most talked about when we go to an industry conference or when you talk to a restauranteur about what's impacting or could impact their business.

Hill: What is the thing we should be watching with beverages over the next few years? Particularly if you look at public companies that have a foot in the hard seltzer space, it really seems like hard seltzer is the hot new thing.

Henkes: It is. As a Generation X person, I equate it to Zima back in the 80s and 90s.

Hill: [laughs] I'm glad I'm not the only one!

Henkes: Nope! But, listen, here's the hard truth of the matter. We do a lot of research around beverage alcohol. For how challenged the restaurant business is, the beverage alcohol part of the restaurant and bar businesses growing even slower. So, what you end up having is, if you're a restaurant that sells alcohol, not only are you faced with these overall traffic challenges that we've been talking about, but now you've got to get people to order a drink once they come in the restaurant. Volume on beer, wine, and spirits has all been essentially flat. Spirits is doing a little bit better. Beer has been in a slight decline. The only reason they're keeping up is craft beer, and even that's starting to slow now. And wine has been challenged, especially in casual dining.

Again, what's happening is a changing consumer. They're drinking less, but they're drinking better. A lot more pre-gaming, especially among younger consumers, where they don't want to spend restaurant prices when they go out to eat, so they'll drink at home. You've got all these delivery services that are offering alcohol where you can essentially get it on demand, again, through Drizly and those types of things. So, the bar business is challenged. Even more so than then the food side of things. If you're selling alcohol, you're trying to figure out how we can capture that beverage occasion. Low-alcohol drinks, because people aren't drinking as much alcohol. We're seeing a lot more mocktails, alcohol-free cocktails. And then, these things like seltzers. I'm probably not the target market for it, but it is something that has taken over. It's light, refreshing. If you look at some of the non-alcohol beverage categories that are growing, sparkling water is one of the fastest growing beverages right now, whether it's sold in grocery stores or in restaurants. So, this takes that seltzer, sparkling water trend, and adds a little bit of a twist, a little bit of a spike to it. It's obviously captivated a lot of Millennials and Generation Z consumers, which I think is who it's aimed at. It's something that has already gotten to be bigger than cider. Cider has been around a long time. The fact that this has exploded the way it has tells me that certainly, there's a lot of interest right now. And I think the question is in the staying power. Like Zima, which when I was in college was the next hot thing, and within five years, it was gone, these seem like they have a little bit more staying power, given the demographic interest and focus that they have. The underlying trends are clear in terms of low-alcohol, refreshing, aimed at the at-home occasion. All of those things are really helping drive things like the spiked seltzer.

2019-09-03 10:39:38,"Tuesday morning brought a holiday hangover to the stock market, with significant losses to start the shortened week on Wall Street. Concerns about new tariffs that took effect over the weekend continue to hurt sentiment, and fears about past seasonal trends that have included substantial sell-offs in the months of September and October aren't helping investors feel more confident. As of 10:30 a.m. EDT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) was down 382 points to 26,021. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) fell 29 points to 2,898, and the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) declined 84 points to 7,878.

Hurting the Dow this morning was Boeing (NYSE: BA) , which saw its stock lose ground amid more bad news for the beleaguered aircraft manufacturer. Meanwhile, on the cryptocurrency front, a long-awaited announcement concerning a possible exchange-traded fund for investing in bitcoin could open up the market to a new group of institutional investors -- but not necessarily to individuals.

Shares of Boeing were down 3% after the aerospace gian t report edly ran into more resistance concerning the grounding of its 737 MAX aircraft lines. Boeing has been working with federal regulators to get approval to get the planes flying again, but according to The Wall Street Journal , those talks aren't going well. Many fear that the tension could lead to an extended delay in the 737 MAX's return to service at least into early 2020.

Image source: Boeing.

Already, Boeing's customers have had to deal with the complications stemming from the grounding. American Airlines Group (NASDAQ: AAL) and United Continental Holdings (NASDAQ: UAL) recently canceled their planned 737 MAX flights through early to mid-December, taking the key Thanksgiving travel season off the table but still leaving open the hope that the planes might be available for the Christmas and New Year's holidays.

Boeing also faces the prospect of seeing customers start to shuffle orders. Rival Airbus has seen its business pick up as a result of Boeing's woes, and that trend could continue if the 737 MAX stays grounded indefinitely. It takes a long time for order shuffling to result in actual delivery changes, but investors have counted on Boeing being able to get the 737 MAX back in the air quickly to regain customer confidence. If that doesn't happen, then further declines in the stock could lie ahead.

Bitcoin prices were up about 3% as cryptocurrency investors  responded to news that an ETF granting access to the bitcoin market will open soon. Yet for those individuals who had hoped to take advantage, there'll be a longer wait.

ETF providers VanEck Securities and SolidX Management announced that they would make shares of their VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust available to a select set of investors on Thursday. However, the companies expect to open the ETF using a rule from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that allows for certain offerings to avoid the extensive regulatory requirements that have prevented bitcoin ETFs from coming onto the market before now.

Under that rule, VanEck and SolidX will do a private placement of bitcoin ETF shares to qualified institutional buyers. That will allow investment without going through the SEC registration process. Unfortunately, it also means that ordinary investors won't have access to shares of VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust.

Bitcoin's rise in 2019 has been impressive, and it's gotten a lot more investors interested in cryptocurrencies again. Yet at least for now, the ease of investing in bitcoin through an ETF still won't be available to individual investors -- even if some hope that VanEck and SolidX's move could push things in the right direction in the future.

CEO Pedro Guimaraes told reporters that regulatory hurdles are delaying planned share sales planned for several of the bank's units.

In March, the company said that it was likely to hold an IPO for its Caixa Seguridade insurance unit in September, as part of a plan to raise 15 billion reais ($3.6 billion) that also included offerings for other units such as its lottery and card operator subsidiaries.

""It doesn't make sense to take two operations of this size to market almost simultaneously,"" he told reporters during a presentation of the company's second-quarter results.

Caixa also expects to sell its stake in bank Banco Pan  through a share offering, Guimaraes said. He called the stake ""nonstrategic"" but added there was no rush to sell it.

 Such devices primarily adopt a multi-operating system, multi-architecture strategies using Apple's iOS, MacOS, Microsoft Windows, Google Chrome and Android operating systems. They predominantly use processors from Apple, Intel (INTC), AMD, Qualcomm (QCOM), NVIDIA (NVDA), Samsung, Broadcom and MediaTek, among others.
 Here are the four major industry themes:

Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects
 The Zacks Computer - Mini Computers industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer And Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #59, which places it in the top 23% of more than 250 Zacks industries.
 The group's Zacks Industry Rank , which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued outperformance in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.
 The industry's positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group's earnings growth potential. Since Apr 30, 2019, the industry's earnings estimate for the current year has increased almost 2.7%.
 Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Lags Sector and S&P 500
 The Zacks Computer - Mini Computers industry has underperformed the broader Zacks Computer And Technology sector as well as the S&P 500 Index over the past year.
 The industry has lost 9.2% over this period compared with the S&P 500's fall of 0.5% and the broader sector's decline of 3.4%.One-Year Price Performance

Industry's Current Valuation
 On the basis of forward 12-month P/E, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing computer stocks, we see that the industry is currently trading at 15.58X compared with the S&P 500's 16.72X. It is also above the sector's forward-12-month P/E of 19.97X.
 Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 17.13X, as low as 10.12X and at the median of 13.66X, as the chart below shows.Forward 12-Month Price-to-Earnings (P/E) RatioStocks to Consider
 None of the stocks in the Computer - Mini Computers industry sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .
 However, Rock Hill, SC-based 3D Systems (DDD) carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company offers hardware and software for 3D printing. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 loss per share has been flat at 11 cents over the past seven days.Price and Consensus: DDD
 We also present a couple of stocks with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) that investors may currently hold on to.
 Cupertino, CA-based Apple is well-known for its flagship iPhone, iPad and Mac personal computers. Apple Watch, HomePod and AirPods are some of its newest consumer offerings. The consensus mark for fiscal 2019 earnings has increased by 4 cents to $11.67 over the past week.Price and Consensus: AAPL
 Palo Alto, CA-based HP is a leading global provider of PCs and imaging and printing products. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2019 earnings stayed put at $2.21 over the past seven days.Price and Consensus: HPQ

Legalizing THIS Could Be Even Bigger than Marijuana
 Americans spend an estimated $150 billion in this industry every year… more than twice as much as they spend on marijuana.

A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Medtronic MDT  , Baxter BAX  and NuVasive NUVA  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2.

Medtronic's long-term earnings growth rate is expected to be 7.13%.

Baxter's long-term earnings growth rate is projected at 12.8%.

NuVasive's long-term earnings growth rate is expected to be 12.75%.

2019-09-03 08:49:48,"By Avi Gilburt, ElliottWaveTrader.net

I am often asked to provide a sample of the analysis I provide to members. So, in this week’s article regarding the stock market, I chose to reproduce the general discussion I provided within my analysis posted to members on Saturday night. Please understand that my detailed charts and the discussion of the specific smaller degree analysis is being left out from this public update, and is only available to members.

Back in the 1930s, an accountant named Ralph Nelson Elliott discovered that financial markets are fractal in nature. This means that they are variably self-similar at different degrees of trend.

To that end, he explained that when a market is trending, it will most often display a rather predictable 5-wave structure. As an example, this structure is what allowed us to predict the rally from the 1800SPX region to over 2600SPX back in 2016, along with our expectation for a “global melt-up,” which we reiterated at election time “no matter who won.” It is what also allowed us to predict the bottoming to the bond market in late 2018, wherein we bought TLT in the 112-113 region, as well as the rally in metals in 2019.

However, once the market completes a 5-wave structure, it then transitions into a corrective state, wherein it whipsaws in 3-wave moves and is much more variable in nature. As an example, this structure is what allowed us to predict the 20% pullback for the SPX in late 2018 once we broke below 2880SPX.

Most recently, once the market completed the 5-wave structure into the high struck in July, it dropped in what is best counted as an initial 3-wave structure. This was the signal to us that the market has now likely transitioned from an impulsive nature into a corrective one, and had us warning our subscribers to be prepared for a wild, whipsaw market. And, the fact that the market has been whipsawing back and forth for the last month supports that perspective.

But, as I noted above, when the market is in a corrective state, it becomes much more variable. While there are certainly signals and patterns we may follow within that corrective state to provide guidance as to its next probable move, the variability of corrective structures often lead to a difficult trading environment, as the market continues to whipsaw.

Yet, this is one of the major benefits of understanding Elliott Wave analysis, for it places the market into a context which I have not seen from any other methodology. This allowed us to warn our members of potential whipsaw action weeks ago, and well before it began. And, when you are alerted to the changing nature of the market, you should be adjusting your trading rules during these corrective states, as trade sizes/risk should be reduced and profits taken often.

Over the last week, we were giving the S&P 500 an opportunity to prove that it was either going to provide us with a 1-2 downside structure to start a c-wave, or morph into a b-wave triangle before that c-wave began. However, when the market broke out slightly over 2939SPX on Friday, it signaled that it may not yet be ready to immediately begin that c-wave down.

Now, as I pointed out above that markets are fractal in nature, I want to highlight a market fractal from late 2018 (chart labeled “SPXfractal”). Basically, this suggests that market sentiment is tracing out a very similar pattern as was seen right before the December drop in 2018. Moreover, if you go back to 2015, 2012, 2011, and 1998 (and many other years as well), you will see a very similar fractal evident on the charts just before the market saw a sizeable decline. And, since history does not exactly repeat, yet does rhyme, when I see a fractal-like this developing in the market, it does place me on high alert for a potential downside setup.

But, even though I view lower levels still to come, I have explained in many recent updates that those who intend to short for a c-wave decline would be best served to wait until the market has developed a 1-2, i-ii downside structure before they turn aggressive on the short side. The main reason is that this frames a potential impending decline in a more structured manner, with much more clearly defined parameters. And, it provides us with the highest probability immediate setup for an impending decline. Since the decline off the July highs, I have been tracking the potential for such a structure, but it has not yet materialized.

The fact that I have been attempting to identify a downside setup may lead some of you to believe that I am a perma-bear. Yet, those that followed my analysis for many years would probably have called me a perma-bull back in early 2016. At the end of the day, I maintain no bias other than the one I read from the market in as objective a fashion as I can humanly attain.

To that end, the one major factor which still keeps me from becoming too bullish too fast is the underlying stocks we track in the stock market. Remember, the stock market is comprised of many individual stocks. And, when the majority of the stocks we track have not pulled back in their larger degree 4th waves just yet, it tells me that I have to maintain a healthy degree of skepticism, at least until the market tells me otherwise. In fact, when I asked our StockWaves analysts how this week’s rally off the lows looks “under the hood,” Zac Mannes put it quite succinctly:

it sounds like a big V8, but when you look under the hood... it is a hamster on a wheel and he looks one revolution away from a coronary.

Yet, Zac did note that there are a few stocks that do have some bullish setups, such as Netflix and Ford as two examples. But, the majority do not support much upside in their current setups.

Now, in taking a step back and putting all this action into perspective, I want you to focus upon the attached monthly chart. As you can see, my long-term perspective for many years has been that we can rally up towards as high as the 4100SPX region in the coming years before this bull market off the 2009 lows completes. That still leaves plenty of room on the upside over the coming years, and is approximately 33% higher than where we are now trading. Yet, we also see the potential for the market to decline 20-30% from where we are trading at this time. That basically means we are now stuck in the middle.

So, rather than becoming aggressive in either direction at this time, I am going to maintain a bit more patience and allow the market to clarify its intentions over the coming months before I am willing to commit to the next 20%+ move. For now, my expectation remains that we will see much lower levels before the last leg of the bull market begins to take us to the 3800-4100 region.

2019-09-03 10:55:32,"Investors in Accenture plc (Symbol: ACN) saw new options become available today, for the October 11th expiration. At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ACN options chain for the new October 11th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.

Because the $192.50 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 63%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.55% return on the cash commitment, or 24.45% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost .

Considering the fact that the $197.50 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 52%.

2019-09-03 09:34:30,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

U.S. stock futures are trading lower this morning, continuing the weakness saw on Friday. Overhead resistance near $2,940 in the S&P 500 has rejected every rally since July's breakdown and last week proved no different. Until buyers can muster the strength to vault back above it, the technical picture will remain bearish.

Ahead of the bell, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are down 0.76%, and S&P 500 futures are lower by 0.62%. Nasdaq-100 futures have lost 0.60%.

In the options pits, Friday's slide propelled put volume ahead of calls on the session, while overall volume settled near average levels. Approximately 16.1 million calls and 16.5 million puts changed hands.

The pop in put demand spilled over to the CBOE, where the single-session equity put/call volume ratio jumped to 0.68 - a one-week high. Meanwhile, the 10-day moving average slipped to 0.67.

Options traders zeroed in on earnings reports Friday. Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ: ULTA ) shares plunged 30% after the company slashed forward guidance. Workday (NASDAQ: WDAY ) slipped below support despite beating earnings estimates. Finally, Shopify (NYSE: SHOP ) saw its third down day in a row, offering an attractive buy-the-dip opportunity.

Let's take a closer look:

Ulta Beauty rose from obscurity over the past decade to become one of the biggest gainers of the bull market. But Friday's 30% plunge revealed all is not well with the American chain of beauty stores. As with many high-flying momentum stocks that fail to live up to lofty expectations, ULTA stock was beaten mercilessly after reporting worse-than-expected second-quarter earnings and lowering full-year guidance.

Ulta's earnings-per-share grew to $2.76 on $1.67 billion in revenue. While both metrics marked modest growth, the uptick wasn't good enough. Analyst estimates were looking for $2.80 in EPS on $1.75 billion in sales. Citing ""headwinds"" in the cosmetics market, the company lowered its full-year EPS forecast by almost a buck, from $12.83-$13.03 to $11.86-$12.06.

Time will tell if Friday's 30% haircut was sufficient to price in the earnings downshift. The next major support zones to watch are $220, then $200.

Options trading exploded with calls outpacing puts on the day. Total activity rocketed to 17x the average daily volume, with 128,030 contracts traded. Calls accounted for 59% of the take.

Premiums were pricing in a gap of just under 7%, so the 30% slashing was a monster move. Traders harnessing long volatility plays like straddles or strangles came out massive winners for the event.

The trend of selling earnings results continued with Workday ahead of the weekend. The provider of human resources software slipped 5.5% despite reporting better-than-expected numbers.

For the quarter, Workday posted earnings of 44 cents per share on revenue of $887.75 million. Both measures bested estimates, but investors wanted even more. With Friday's beatdown, WDAY stock has now fallen 22% off its highs. It now rests below all major moving averages with the 50-day and 20-day both trending lower. Volume patterns aren't helping the bull case either, with multiple distribution days cropping up over the past six weeks.

On the options trading front, calls slightly edged out puts in popularity. Activity swelled to 629% of the average daily volume, with 80,254 total contracts traded; 52% of the total came from calls.

With the uncertainty of earnings in the rearview mirror, implied volatility plunged to 36% or the 25th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are now baking in daily moves of $3.97 or 2.2%.

Shopify shares suffered their third straight down day ahead of the weekend amid well-deserved profit-taking. Chart watchers shouldn't be concerned one bit over the bout of selling. It was perfectly benign and was likely due to garden variety register ringing after a substantial $100 rise in SHOP stock.

After rallying almost $14 off the lows, SHOP only ended the day down 1.6%. Volume was slightly above average, but nothing high enough to scare the children. All-in-all, I'm taking Shopify's appearance atop the most-active options leaderboard as an excuse to highlight its beautiful uptrend and rock star 2019 performance. The shares are up 178% year-to-date.

The cloud-based commerce company saw a sharp uptick in options trading. Total activity swelled to 213% of the average daily volume, with 80,270 contracts traded; 52% of the trading came from call options.

Implied volatility ticked up to 29%, landing it at the 26th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are baking in daily moves of $11.89 or 3.1%. Bull call spreads are my strategy of choice here.

2019-09-03 06:34:00," Shares of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. APD  have popped around 25% over the past six months. The company has also significantly outperformed its industry  's decline of roughly 31% over the same time frame.  makeArticleAd();  Air Products, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, has a market cap of roughly $49.8 billion and average volume of shares traded in the last three months was around 1,043.8K. The company has an expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 12.1%, above the industry average of 10.1%.       Let's take a look into the factors that are driving this industrial gases giant.   Driving Factors    Better-than-expected earnings performance in the fiscal third quarter, upbeat outlook and healthy growth prospects have contributed to the rally in Air Products' shares.    The company's profits from continuing operations rose around 13% year over year to $488 million or $2.20 per share in the fiscal third quarter. Adjusted earnings went up 11% year over year to $2.17 per share, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.14. Air Products gained from higher volumes and pricing in the quarter.    Air Products, in its third-quarter call, said that it now expects adjusted earnings for fiscal 2019 in the range of $8.20-$8.25 per share. This suggests more than 10% rise year over year at the midpoint.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for fiscal 2019 of $8.24 reflects an expected year-over-year growth of 10.6%. Moreover, earnings are expected to register a 14.5% growth in the fiscal fourth quarter.    Air Products' strategic investments in high-return projects, productivity actions and contributions of acquisitions should drive its fiscal 2019 results. Notably, the Lu'An syngas project in China is contributing to the results in the company's Industrial Gases - Asia segment. The company expects the Lu'An project to contribute more than 25 cents per share to its earnings in fiscal 2019.    The company has a total available capacity to deploy (over fiscal 2018-2022) nearly $17 billion in high-return investments, aimed at creating significant shareholder value.

2019-09-03 10:13:00," The United States currently has the second-largest wind energy market in the world after China. According to the American Wind Energy Association, wind power is expanding rapidly in many regions across the nation which ramped up wind energy project development activities in the second quarter of 2019.  makeArticleAd();  Impressively, during the first half of 2019, the U.S. wind industry installed 1,577 megawatts (MW) of new wind power capacity, reflecting a 53% increase over the first half of 2018.   Factors Driving Wind Energy Growth in US    Over the past few years, the U.S. wind energy market has witnessed considerable growth on several major factors with increasing corporate investments, reduced cost of components and the primary one, coming in the form of favorable tax credits.    Per a report by National Renewable Energy Laboratory, wind energy investment  in the United States has averaged nearly $13.6 billion annually, since 2006. Last year, installed wind energy projects represented more than $12 billion of new private investments. Such growing investments are boosting the adoption of wind power-purchase agreements (PPA).    Meanwhile, factors like declining turbine prices  and operating costs and low interest rates have dragged down wind PPA prices below 2 cents per kilowatt-hour (KWh) per a report by the U.S. Department of Energy.    Over the past few years, wind power development in the United States has been extensively supported by production tax credits  . A couple of months back, two bills were introduced by the U.S. Senate to extend the federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for offshore wind energy projects. The introduction of these bills is expected to generate additional infrastructural investments.    In fact, improving project economics and favorable state policies have been boosting offshore wind activities  in the United States of late. According to a report by the American Wind Energy association, the country's offshore wind sector is poised to rapidly increase installations to a total of 22,000 MW of offshore wind projects by 2030 and 86,000 MW by 2050. Thanks to the abundant opportunities, the offshore wind sector has been seeing high investments.   Expanding U.S. Wind Industry Prospects    The industry has a record amount of wind generation projects expected to commence operations in the near future, with staggering 35,135 MW of wind capacity either under construction or in the advanced development stage across 31 states. Moreover, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects wind to emerge as the leading source of renewable electricity generation in the United States by 2020.   Stocks to Consider    We have zeroed in three big players in the wind industry that investors might want to keep a tab on.    NextEra Energy NEE  , a Zacks Rank #3 company, has an avera ge earnings  surprise of 2.92% for the last four quarters and an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 8%.    Avangrid, Inc. AGR  , a Zacks Rank #3 company, has a year-over-year earnings growth estimate of 8.55% for 2020 and an estimated long- term earnings growth rate of 7.5%.

2019-09-03 09:22:00,"  Microsoft MSFT  recently secured a significant deal win from the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) and U.S. Department of Defense (DOD).  makeArticleAd();  Notably, three of Microsoft's vendors - Minburn Technology Group LLC, Dell Marketing L.P. and General Dynamics' GD  CSRA LLC, have been recently awarded  the Defense Enterprise Office Solutions (or DEOS) Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA).    Per the terms of the deal, the contract partners will provide DOD with Microsoft's cloud-based enterprise software capabilities. It primarily includes Office 365 collaborative tools, file sharing, productivity tools including cloud email, and storage.    Microsoft's Office 365 will aid DOD to modernize IT infrastructure, and strengthen cybersecurity functionalities in cost-efficient manner. This marks a shift from DOD's prior use of ""legacy"" solutions from Oracle ORCL  and IBM, per reports.    Markedly, per DOD, the DEOS BPA contract is valued at $7.6 billion spread over 10 year time period. This highlights Microsoft's increasing association with DOD, which is a major positive.    Reportedly, Amazon AMZN  , which is contesting with Microsoft for Pentagon's Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure or JEDI contract, opted out from bidding.   Key Takeaways    Deal Wins Favor Business Prospects     Utilization of Office 365 by DOD reinforces Microsoft's strength in cloud-based services aimed at accelerating enterprise and IT processes.    The tech giant is infusing AI capabilities across its portfolio of services, which includes Azure, Windows, Cortana, Gaming, Office 365, Dynamics 365, HoloLens. This is enabling it to secure deal wins, which bodes well for its top line and enhances growth prospects.    In fact, in January, 2019, the company clinched a five-year contract worth $1.76-billion from DoD, under which the company's enterprise services will be utilized by the Pentagon Defense Department, cloud Coast Guard and intelligence services.    Markedly, in the las t report  ed quarter  , Microsoft's Office 365 commercial revenues improved 31% (34% at constant currency), driven by strong installed base growth and average revenues per user (ARPU) expansion.    Overall, revenues from Productivity & Business Processes  , which includes the Office and Dynamics CRM businesses, increased 14% (up 17% at cc) on a year-over-year basis to $11 billion (representing 32.6% of total revenues).

With more viewers flocking to online platforms for content, NFL has been signing partnerships worth millions of dollars, with companies including Amazon.com  and Twitter  to stream content.

Created by Beijing Bytedance Technology Co, TikTok allows users to create and share short videos with special effects, and is hugely popular in Southeast Asia, including India.

With the presence of celebrities like Ariana Grande and Katy Perry, the platform is a hit among teenagers and post-millennials, a key target audience of sports content.

""Partnering with TikTok is a natural extension of our media strategy,"" said Blake Stuchin, vice president, Digital Media Business Development for the NFL.

2019-09-03 11:39:57,"Investors in SunPower Corp (Symbol: SPWR) saw new options become available today, for the October 11th expiration. At Stock Options Channel  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the SPWR options chain for the new October 11th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.    The put contract at the $12.00 strike price has a current bid of 72 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $12.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $11.28 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SPWR, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $12.61/share today. Because the $12.00 strike represents an approximate 5% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 64%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.00% return on the cash commitment, or 57.63% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost  .  makeArticleAd();  Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for SunPower Corp, and highlighting in green where the $12.00 strike is located relative to that history:       Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $13.00 strike price has a current bid of 73 cents. If an investor was to purchase shares of SPWR stock at the current price level of $12.61/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $13.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.88% if the stock gets called away at the October 11th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if SPWR shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for SunPower Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing SPWR's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $13.00 strike highlighted in red:    Considering the fact that the $13.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 51%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.79% boost of extra return to the investor, or 55.61% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost  .    The implied volatility in the put contract example is 68%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 64%.

2019-09-03 12:26:10,"   After a decade of unprecedented monetary stimulus around the world, actual inflation and inflation expectations remain stubbornly low in most major economies. Inflation is falling persistently short of central bank targets even in economies operating beyond full employment-notably the U.S. It is even more unusual to see a drop in inflation expectations in the late-cycle stage when concerns would typically focus on overheating. See the chart below.     Monetary policy-both conventional and unconventional-works through lower interest rates. Lowering rates across the yield curve helps stimulate demand by lowering the cost of financing consumption or investment. It also gives investors incentives to re-balance into riskier assets, in principle reducing the cost of capital for companies. If policy rates are near their effective lower bound (ELB) and the scope for longer term rates to fall is limited, monetary policy cannot provide much more stimulus through this channel-a liquidity trap situation. We detailed the factors that have been driving the decline in interest rates in our November 2017 paper The safety premium driving low rates  . The secular decline in neutral interest rates (r-star)-the estimate of rates that neither stimulates nor hinders economic growth - has reduced the distance from the effective lower bound (ELB) and thereby how much the central bank can cut in a downturn. Lower potential growth is one factor, but our r-star estimate, based on a Federal Reserve model, has fallen by more than growth since the mid-2000s-especially after the crisis. We believe this wedge reflects the role played by an increase in global risk aversion, initially stoked after the late-1990s Asia financial crisis and later magnified by the global financial crisis (GFC). These severe shocks motivated persistently higher precautionary savings by both the public and private sectors, dragging down the neutral rate. Our estimates  suggest that greater risk aversion and lower potential growth each account equally for the roughly 150 basis point decline in the U.S. r-star since the GFC. Flattening the curve  Rising risk aversion also makes perceived safe assets more alluring and compresses their yields relative to other assets. This is why investors are pushing interest rates ever lower and flattening out yield curves. Nominal yields on long-term government bonds are at new record lows-the entire German bund yield curve is now negative-or back near historic ones in the U.S. The term premium-the compensation that investors typically demand for bearing the greater risk of long-term bonds-is negative again. Interest rates in Europe and Japan may already be near their ultimate floor as long as there is still physical cash.     The chart above shows the current U.S. Treasury yield curve compared with a hypothetical one based on the median curve moves during the recessions of recent decades, adjusted for structural changes to neutral rates. We do this to get a sense of how the curve might need to shift lower from current levels if it were to react in a similar fashion as during past recessions. To get a similar move now, short-term rates would need to drop to around -2%. We believe such a move is highly unlikely if not impossible-the ELB where central banks stop cutting rates, and investors stop chasing negative yields, is almost certainly higher than this. Central banks are running out of room to cut rates. What other options are available? In the next blog in this series, I will discuss fiscal policy-both its attractions and its limitations. For more on this topic, read our paper, ""Dealing with the next downturn.""

NEW  YORK, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Tuesday, with U.S. crude futures down 2% after manufacturing data raised concerns about a weakening global economy, while the U.S.-China trade dispute continued to drag on investor sentiment.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude  futures fell $1.16, or 2.1%, to settle at $53.94 a barrel. The session low was $52.84 a barrel, the lowest since Aug. 9.

Prices extended losses following data that showed U.S. manufacturing activity in August contracted for the first time in three years.  Earlier, separate data showed euro zone manufacturing activity contracted for a seventh month in August. 

""That deterioration is continuing to undermine the demand growth outlook for oil,"" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital in New York.

Oil prices have fallen around 20% since a 2019 peak reached in April, hit by concerns the trade war would dent oil demand.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that trade talks between the United States and China were going well, though he warned he would be ""tougher"" in negotiations if discussions drag on until his second term.  Trump said the two sides would meet for talks this month.

Chinese Vice Premier Liu He said China firmly opposes a trade war, the state news agency Xinhua reported. 

Washington began imposing 15% tariffs on an array of Chinese imports on Sunday, while China began placing new duties on U.S. crude oil.

The U.S.-China trade dispute ""is the single most important flat price driver of late,"" said Tamas Varga of oil brokerage PVM.

On the supply side, Venezuela's oil exports fell in August to their lowest level in 2019, internal reports and Refinitiv Eikon data showed, following tougher U.S. sanctions. 

Russian oil production  in August rose to 11.294 million barrels per day (bpd), data showed on Monday, hitting its highest since March and topping the rate Moscow pledged under a pact with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). 

""Downside price pressures were accentuated today by weekend indications that OPEC had lifted production in August on a month-to-month basis for the first time this year while Russia is reportedly producing beyond agreed upon quota,"" Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note.

Data due this week on U.S. inventory levels will be delayed by a day to Wednesday and Thursday because of the U.S. Labor Day holiday on Monday.

2019-09-03 13:47:24,"Legendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.    In trading on Tuesday, shares of Mosaic Co (Symbol: MOS) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 29.3, after changing hands as low as $17.75 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF ( SPY  ) is 48.1. A bullish investor could look at MOS's 29.3 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. The chart below shows the one year performance of MOS shares:     Looking at the chart above, MOS's low point in its 52 week range is $17.36 per share, with $37.37 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $17.77.  makeArticleAd();   Find out what 9 other oversold stocks you need to   know about »

Sept 3 (Reuters) - Argentina's peso gained for a second day on Tuesday following capital controls amid a deepening financial crisis, while ongoing U.S.-China trade tensions dented Latin American stocks.

The peso  opened sharply stronger, up 6% officially against the dollar, marking Wall Street's first reaction to Argentina's new currency controls after a long holiday weekend in the United States.

""The black market rate is lower then the official suggesting that there is still some pressures there,"" said Edward Glossop, Latam economist at Capital Economics.

""History suggests that capital controls do sometimes help to alleviate pressure on currencies in the near term, but over the longer term when people start finding loopholes in the system.  That's when it makes it more difficult.""

The controls come after markets reacted sharply to rating downgrades by Standard and Poor, Fitch and Moody's, after the government announced its plans to ""re-profile"" some $100 billion in debt.

MSCI's index of Latin American stocks  was 0.2% lower, in-line with global equities as investors fret about Washington and China's struggle to schedule a meeting this month to renew trade talks. MKTS/GLOB

The Merval stock index in Buenos Aires  shed 3.7%after having closed 6% higher in the previous session.

Stocks in Chile  declined 0.7%, while the peso  fell to its lowest since January 2016 ahead of a decision by the central bank's on monetary policy.

""We think that the central bank will lower the monetary policy rate by 50bps, to 2.00%, in today's monetary policy,"" said analysts from Credit Suisse in a note.

2019-09-03 11:35:26,"Investors in Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc (Symbol: ACAD) saw new options begin trading today, for the October 11th expiration. At Stock Options Channel  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ACAD options chain for the new October 11th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.    The put contract at the $25.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.10. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $25.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $23.90 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ACAD, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $25.85/share today. Because the $25.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 61%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.40% return on the cash commitment, or 42.26% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost  .  makeArticleAd();  Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc, and highlighting in green where the $25.00 strike is located relative to that history:       Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $26.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.45. If an investor was to purchase shares of ACAD stock at the current price level of $25.85/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $26.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.19% if the stock gets called away at the October 11th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ACAD shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing ACAD's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $26.00 strike highlighted in red:    Considering the fact that the $26.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 46%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.61% boost of extra return to the investor, or 53.88% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost  .    The implied volatility in the put contract example is 67%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 75%.    Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $25.85) to be 67%.

2019-09-03 16:15:15," In late August,   Johnson & Johnson    (NYSE: JNJ) was hit with a hefty   $572 million fine    for its role in the opioid crisis in Oklahoma, which was still   not as bad as it could have been    . In what could prove to be a monumental case in the U.S., it   could just be the beginning of a much larger fallout. As many as   130 people   die daily as a result of overdosing on   opioids    . Johnson & Johnson and other pharmaceuticals have reason to   be worried, as Oklahoma's opioid problem is not nearly as severe   as it is in other states. According to   2017 data    from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the state   had a death rate relating to drug overdoses of 20.1 per 100,000   people, with 775 total deaths occurring that year. In contrast,   West Virginia had the highest rate of death at 57.8 per 100,000   people while Pennsylvania, Florida, and Ohio each had more than   5,000 people lose their lives as a result of overdosing. While   the fine in Oklahoma may not be that big of a burden for Johnson   & Johnson, the amount could be a drop in the bucket compared   to what a potential payout may be in other states should they be   successful in pursuing similar types of litigation. The company   said it plans to appeal the ruling.  The cannabis impact  The importance of the issue is evident from a cost standpoint,   especially if the ruling against Johnson & Johnson holds up.   Companies are likely to start taking opioids more seriously and   look into alternative treatment options. One industry where   healthcare companies may start to focus on is cannabis. Colorado,   New York, and Illinois already   allow doctors to recommend cannabis in place of   opioids    .makeArticleAd();   IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.  The challenge when it comes to cannabis is that while there's   a lot of anecdotal evidence claiming marijuana use helps users   deal with pain, there just isn't hard data to support that. To   make matters worse, it's also hard to get research done on   cannabis to be able to even prove or disprove its effectiveness   since it remains a Schedule I drug, illegal on a federal level.   These limitations make it difficult to prove whether cannabis can   help the situation or not. In addition, there has been   research     to suggest that cannabis is not a blanket solution to the   opioid crisis. However, the research is by no means comprehensive   and there's a clear need for more research before any definitive   links can be drawn. Even one of the more   critical studies      acknowledged that ""a great majority of adults who used   cannabis did not go on to initiate or increase their nonmedical   opioid use."" Meanwhile, veterans are   urging the government    to help them access medical marijuana, which has been more   effective for some in treating post-traumatic stress disorder   than opioids. Unfortunately, there's no one right answer to the question of   whether cannabis can help the opioid crisis. What is evident,   though, is that more research is needed to help understand in   which circumstances it may be helpful and in which it may not be.   To say conclusively that it does or doesn't help would be   premature given the conflicting data.  We're still early in the process  To date, only   GW Pharmaceuticals    (NASDAQ: GWPH)  has successfully launched a cannabis-based   drug in the U.S., called Epidiolex. And it could be a long time   before we see any others get approved as well given the legal   hurdles involved. However, the Johnson & Johnson ruling could   be the catalyst that at least gets pharmaceutical companies   looking into potential alternatives, ones that include   cannabis.  Why this matters for investors  From an investment standpoint, there's obviously a lot of   potential growth that could be at hand for a company with a   significant position in the medical marijuana segment like   Aurora Cannabis    . If cannabis is shown to be an effective treatment option in   place of opioids, we could see much more demand for   Aurora's products     and for the industry as a whole.

In late August,   Johnson & Johnson    (NYSE: JNJ) was hit with a hefty   $572 million fine    for its role in the opioid crisis in Oklahoma, which was still   not as bad as it could have been    . In what could prove to be a monumental case in the U.S., it   could just be the beginning of a much larger fallout. As many as   130 people   die daily as a result of overdosing on   opioids    .

Johnson & Johnson and other pharmaceuticals have reason to   be worried, as Oklahoma's opioid problem is not nearly as severe   as it is in other states. According to   2017 data    from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the state   had a death rate relating to drug overdoses of 20.1 per 100,000   people, with 775 total deaths occurring that year. In contrast,   West Virginia had the highest rate of death at 57.8 per 100,000   people while Pennsylvania, Florida, and Ohio each had more than   5,000 people lose their lives as a result of overdosing. While   the fine in Oklahoma may not be that big of a burden for Johnson   & Johnson, the amount could be a drop in the bucket compared   to what a potential payout may be in other states should they be   successful in pursuing similar types of litigation. The company   said it plans to appeal the ruling.

The importance of the issue is evident from a cost standpoint,   especially if the ruling against Johnson & Johnson holds up.   Companies are likely to start taking opioids more seriously and   look into alternative treatment options. One industry where   healthcare companies may start to focus on is cannabis. Colorado,   New York, and Illinois already   allow doctors to recommend cannabis in place of   opioids    .

The challenge when it comes to cannabis is that while there's   a lot of anecdotal evidence claiming marijuana use helps users   deal with pain, there just isn't hard data to support that. To   make matters worse, it's also hard to get research done on   cannabis to be able to even prove or disprove its effectiveness   since it remains a Schedule I drug, illegal on a federal level.   These limitations make it difficult to prove whether cannabis can   help the situation or not.

In addition, there has been   research     to suggest that cannabis is not a blanket solution to the   opioid crisis. However, the research is by no means comprehensive   and there's a clear need for more research before any definitive   links can be drawn. Even one of the more   critical studies      acknowledged that ""a great majority of adults who used   cannabis did not go on to initiate or increase their nonmedical   opioid use."" Meanwhile, veterans are   urging the government    to help them access medical marijuana, which has been more   effective for some in treating post-traumatic stress disorder   than opioids.

Unfortunately, there's no one right answer to the question of   whether cannabis can help the opioid crisis. What is evident,   though, is that more research is needed to help understand in   which circumstances it may be helpful and in which it may not be.   To say conclusively that it does or doesn't help would be   premature given the conflicting data.

To date, only   GW Pharmaceuticals    (NASDAQ: GWPH)  has successfully launched a cannabis-based   drug in the U.S., called Epidiolex. And it could be a long time   before we see any others get approved as well given the legal   hurdles involved. However, the Johnson & Johnson ruling could   be the catalyst that at least gets pharmaceutical companies   looking into potential alternatives, ones that include   cannabis.

From an investment standpoint, there's obviously a lot of   potential growth that could be at hand for a company with a   significant position in the medical marijuana segment like   Aurora Cannabis    . If cannabis is shown to be an effective treatment option in   place of opioids, we could see much more demand for   Aurora's products     and for the industry as a whole. It could also lead to a   big pharmaceutical company finally dipping its toes into the   medical marijuana market. It's very early on, but last week's   ruling could help lead to some medical professionals taking   another look at cannabis, and that could be huge for the   industry.

NEW YORK, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The dollar climbed on Tuesdayto its strongest level in over two years against a basket ofcurrencies as traders favored the greenback on worries aboutU.S.-China trade tensions and a chaotic British exit from theEuropean Union.

The dollar's initial gains abated in the wake of a privatereport that showed the U.S. manufacturing sector recorded itsfirst monthly contraction since 2016 in August. urn:newsml:reuters.com:*:nL2N25R073

Last month's steeper-than-expected decline in the factoryactivity index from Institute for Supply Management also touchedoff a rally in the U.S. bond market, sending benchmark 10-yearyields US10YT=RR to their lowest levels since July 2016. urn:newsml:reuters.com:*:nL2N25U0O6

""This is a safe-haven trade rather than a rate-differentialtrade,"" said Steven Englander, global head of G10 FX research atStandard Chartered in New York.

Bloomberg News reported that Chinese and U.S. officials arestruggling to agree on a schedule for a round of tradenegotiations that had been expected this month.

The euro stabilized after tumbling to a 28-month low againstthe dollar earlier Tuesday as investors priced in deepernegative interest rates for longer in the euro zone.

Money markets have increased to more than 80% theprobability that the European Central Bank will cut itsbenchmark rate by 20 basis points when it meets next week.

The euro EUR=EBS was little changed on the day at $1.09645. It fell to $1.0926 earlier, its lowest since mid-May2017. A break below the key $1.1000 level last week had sparkedheavier sell-offs.

The dollar weakened against the yen and the Swiss franc inthe aftermath of disappointing ISM manufacturing data.

The greenback fell 0.37% to 105.87 yen and decreased 0.31%to 0.98735 franc.

2019-09-03 09:39:00,"LUSAKA, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Zambia should keep mineral royalties capped at 7.5% in the 2020 budget to safeguard the health of the mining sector and promote additional investment, the Chamber of Mines said on Tuesday.

The mining body said in proposals submitted to the finance ministry that the 2019 mining tax regime had raised the tax burden on mines to unsustainable and uncompetitive levels.

Africa's No.2 copper producer increased its sliding scale for royalties of 4 to 6% by 1.5 percentage points and introduced a new 10% tax when the price of copper exceeds $7,500 per tonne.

""If the 1.5% increment on each band of the sliding scale is to be maintained, the maximum rate should be capped at 7.5%, for an LME copper price equalling or exceeding US$7,500/tonne,"" the Chamber of Mines said.

The mineral royalty tax should also be tax-deductible for mining firms as making it non-deductible as Zambia does amounts to taxation on revenue not received, it said.

""Zambia is the only mining jurisdiction not allowing a deduction for these costs,"" it said.

The Chamber said a proposed switch to a non-refundable sales tax from a refundable value-added tax should be delayed for at least two years until it is refined.

It also urged a waiver on import duty on copper and cobalt concentrates, saying Zambia has excess smelting capacity which should not be forfeited to competing neighbouring states.

Zambia should also keep mining energy tariff increases in step with inflation over the next three years until a cost of service study is completed and a new tariff plan agreed with indstry, it said.

A ministry of finance spokesman was not immedaitely available for comment.

2019-09-03 09:35:00," Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn't want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?  makeArticleAd();  One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let's put LyondellBasell Industries N.V. LYB  stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:   PE Ratio    A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar o f earnings  in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock's current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.    On this front, LyondellBasell Industries has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 7.93, as you can see in the chart below:      This level actually compares favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 18.02. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, LyondellBasell Industries' current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 8.98 over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months. However, the current level stands below the highs for the stock, suggesting that it can be a solid entry point.      Moreover, the stock's PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Basic Materials Market sector's trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 13.98. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.      We should also point out that LyondellBasell Industries has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year's earnings) of 7.53, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for LyondellBasell Industries' stock in the near term too.   P/S Ratio    Another key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock's price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.    Right now, LyondellBasell Industries has a P/S ratio of about 0.78. This is much lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.17 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.     Broad Value Outlook    In aggregate, LyondellBasell Industries currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes LyondellBasell Industries a solid choice for value investors.    For example, the PEG ratio for LyondellBasell Industries is just 0.84, a level that is lower than the industry average of 1.04. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock's earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 5.24, which is better than the industry average of 6.31. Clearly, LYB is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.   What About the Stock Overall?    Though LyondellBasell Industries might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and Momentum Score of D. This gives LYB a Zacks VGM score - or its overarching fundamental grade - of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>  )    Meanwhile, the company's recen t earnings  estimates have been mixed at the best. The current year estimate witnessed one upward revision in the past sixty days compared to four downward revisions, while the full year 2020 estimate witnessed four upward revisions compared to two downward revisions in the same time period.    As a result, the current year consensus estimate declined 1.82% in the past two months, whereas the full year 2020 estimate increased 1.67%.

Bottom Line    LyondellBasell Industries is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (bottom 13% out of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the broader industry has underperformed the market at large, as you can see below:      So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.

 Bottom Line    LyondellBasell Industries is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (bottom 13% out of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the broader industry has underperformed the market at large, as you can see below:

     So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.   Legalizing THIS Could Be Even Bigger than Marijuana    Americans spend an estimated $150 billion in this industry every year… more than twice as much as they spend on marijuana.    Now that 8 states have fully-legalized it (with several more states following close behind), Zacks has identified 5 stocks that could soar in response to the powerful demand. One industry insider described the future as ""mind-blowing"" - and early investors can still get in ahead of the surge.   See these 5 ""sin stocks"" now >>

2019-09-03 06:36:00,"Whether you're thinking of retiring one year, three years, or 10 years from now, it's a decision that shouldn't be taken lightly. And while there are many factors that will no doubt go into it, you must address these three important points before taking that leap.

Social Security will likely constitute a decent chunk of your retirement income, so it's imperative that you claim your benefits strategically. If you file at your full retirement age , which, depending on your year of birth, is either 66, 67, or somewhere in between, you'll get the exact monthly benefit your earnings history entitles you to. File before full retirement age (you can do so as early as age 62) and you'll face a reduction in benefits that will most likely remain in effect for the rest of your life. Another option is to delay benefits past full retirement age, which will increase them by 8% a year up until you turn 70.

IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.

Your Social Security filing decision will impact your spouse, too, if you're married. If your spouse never worked, he or she can claim spousal benefits , but only once you start collecting your benefits. Furthermore, your spouse is entitled to survivors benefits once you pass, assuming he or she outlives you, so the higher a paycheck you get from Social Security, the more your spouse gets as well.

Many people retire in the same city they lived in during their working years. Others, meanwhile, relocate to benefit from things like better weather and a lower cost of living. The place you'll be living during retirement will largely determine how much income (and savings) you need to cover your expenses, so it's a decision you'll need to land on in advance.

When determining how affordable a city is, you'll need to focus on things like housing costs, property taxes (if you're planning to be a homeowner), and income taxes, which can vary significantly from one state to another. Keep in mind that some states also impose a tax on Social Security benefits , so if you want to avoid losing a portion of that income, you may want to cross them off your list (though some states that tax Social Security also offer a relatively low cost of living, so you'll need to weigh the positive against the negative).

Boredom can be a retiree's worst nightmare, especially when it leads to feelings of sadness and worthlessness that can be harmful from a mental and health-related perspective. That's why you must figure out what you'll do with your newfound free time before pulling the plug on your career. Maybe you'll start a small business , or focus on hobbies that fell by the wayside all that time you were working. Or maybe you'll travel a lot or volunteer for an organization you've always supported.

There are plenty of things you can do with your days in retirement, but have some ideas mapped out beforehand. Also, make sure they're realistic given your financial situation. You may want to explore the globe, but if you don't have the funds to support that goal, you'll need a backup plan.

Another thing -- make sure your spouse is on board with your plans. For example, you may have the money to travel, but if your spouse wants to mostly stay local, that could be the source of a conflict you're better off resolving ahead of time.

The last thing you want to do is rush into retirement and regret that decision after the fact. Before bringing your career to a close, be sure to address the above points and make sure you have clear direction on each. Doing so could help you avoid a world of stress -- and distress -- during your golden years.

The $16,728 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook
 If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings.

At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the GDX options chain for the new October 11th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.

Because the $30.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.57% return on the cash commitment, or 34.26% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost .

Considering the fact that the $31.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

On our website under the contract detail page for this contract , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

Healthy Dividend Payout:  The company has been consistently paying out a healthy dividend to its shareholders. It has a strong balance sheet with industry-leading dividend. During the first six months of 2019, the company used $52.1 million of cash for financing activities, primarily related to dividend payments totaling $35.6 million (versus $33.8 million a year ago).

2019-09-03 15:18:42,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

WeBull Financial LLC was founded in 2017 with a simple premise of merging technology and finance to create an easy-to-use, zero-commission brokerage and market data app to aid investors of all levels. 

Although the WeBull app has over 10 million users, it's really geared toward experienced traders who want advanced real-time market data options combined with first-rate charting on a trading platform that's available 24/7 with zero fees for account opening, account management and trading commissions. 

By keeping costs low and simultaneously providing the fundamental and technical analysis necessary for users to make split-second decisions, WeBull is putting institutional-caliber technology in the hands of everyday investors. 

Oh, you still need to make the right calls, but when you've got the resources of WeBull and its low-cost trading platform behind you, the opportunity to buy stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and American Depository Reciepts (ADRs) has never been so easy.

WeBull is regulated by both the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). This means less funny business and more trading without worry.

WeBull Financial LLC is a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). Individual customers' securities are protected up to $500,000 and a $250,000 maximum for cash. In addition, its clearing firm, Apex Clearing, provides additional insurance coverage for an aggregate of $150 million in securities and cash for its entire customer base. 

Further, WeBull offers zero commissions on more than 5,000 U.S. equities and ETFs. There is, however, an SEC and FINRA trading fee on all sales. E.g. If you sell 100 shares at $10 a share, the SEC and FINRA fees would amount to 22 cents. Not bad for a $10,000 trade.

WeBull also provides margin trading with an annual margin rate between 3.99% and 6.99% , depending on the amount borrowed. Anything up to $25,000 is charged 6.99%. Anything above $3 million is charged at 3.99%. There's a sliding scale in between. 

If you're day trading, you can leverage up to four times the amount you've contributed to your account; if you hold for more than a day, you can leverage up to twice the amount. 

What's more, there arenNo extraneous fees for account opening, account management or software platform fees. And seasoned investors may like being able to short stocks. 

Other pros include:

The biggest negative of WeBull is that it doesn't provide trading in stock options, over-the-counter stocks, mutual funds, bonds or cryptocurrencies. Considering it provides quotes for some of these securities, it would be nice if you could also buy them at the same time. 

The second negative about WeBull is that it currently only supports individual cash and margin accounts . It does not support IRAs or any other type of tax-advantaged investment accounts. 

Not really a con, as much as an observation for investors considering WeBull, are the fees for transferring cash and stocks in and out of the platform. The fee for depositing cash via a domestic wire is $8; the fee for transferring cash out of WeBull is $25. The fee for transferring cash by international wire from outside the U.S. is $12.50; the fee for transferring cash via international wire from outside the U.S. is $45. The fees for transferring securities in and out of WeBull range from $0 to $75 depending on whether you use Apex Clearing or a Contra Broker. Apex charges $75 to transfer out securities. 

Although WeBull provides basic real-time quotes at no cost to users, advanced quotes are available for a monthly subscription varying from $3.99 a month to $82.99 a month depending on which stock exchange you're subscribing to for advanced quotes. Considering you can't buy stocks on many of these exchanges, it's unlikely you'd want the advanced quotes in these markets. 

WeBull's zero commissions will be attractive to investors of all experience levels. The mobile app provides plenty of information to keep track of your favorite stocks and ETFs. It's definitely worth downloading the app just to try out its $1 million paper trading account. 

If you're a more experienced trader, there appears to be enough meat on the bone to make it worth your while to give WeBull a try. However, if you're trading stocks for a living, you might want to consider other options available that don't provide zero commissions but do provide a robust trading platform that goes beyond what a zero-commission brokerage account is able to deliver. 

WeBull could be a useful tool for the average buy-and-hold investor to follow a concentrated portfolio of stocks or ETFs. However, as I mentioned earlier, it doesn't support tax-advantaged accounts, so if you want a low-cost way to save for retirement, WeBull might not be right for you. 

As always, it pays to do your own due diligence, but from what I've seen, it's worth checking out more closely. 

As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-03 17:21:00," Specialty retailer   Conn's    (NASDAQ: CONN)  reported record quarterly earnings per share   in its fiscal second quarter of 2020, in results released before   markets opened on Tuesday. The furniture, appliances, and   consumer credit chain also signaled imminent relief from a weight   on comparable-store sales. We'll discuss the all-important metric   of comps below, along with other crucial details from the   quarter. Note that all comparative numbers that follow refer to   those of the prior-year quarter. Conn's: The raw numbers  Data source: Conn's. What happened with Conn's this quarter?  Retail sales rose 3.3% to $306.1 million, led by new store     openings. The company added four locations during the quarter,     bringing its total to 131. Additional sales from new locations compensated for a     decline in same-store sales. Comps were pressured by areas hit     by Hurricane Harvey; stronger sales over the last two years in     these markets have made for tough comparisons this year, as     recovery activities from the 2017 storm wind down. Comps in     Harvey-impacted markets slumped by 9.3%, while all other     markets collectively managed a comps increase of 0.4%. Retail     gross margin       slipped by 90     basis points       to 40.5%. Conn's consumer credit segment improved revenue by 7.5% to     $94.8 million. Management attributed the increase primarily to     robust origination of Conn's high-yielding direct consumer loan     product, and higher average customer receivable balances. The consumer credit segment's provision for bad debts     decreased by 1.5% to $49.8 million. Coupled with higher revenue     and lower selling, general, and administrative (SG&A)     expenses as a percentage of fee income, the lower loss     provision helped cut the segment's pre-tax quarterly loss     roughly in half, to $8.7 million. Consolidated SG&A expense crept up just 40 basis points     despite the company's higher quarterly sales, to 31.8%. Conn's     exerted tight cost discipline across the board, as consolidated     operating margin      improved by 20 basis points to 10.4%. Conn's overall net income and EPS also benefited from lower     interest expense, which declined by $1.2 million to $14.4     million, due to early retirement of debt in the previous     year. The company repurchased $34.3 million of its own shares     during the second quarter, marking its first share buyback     during the fiscal year.    Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();  What management had to say In Conn's' earnings press release, CEO Norm Miller detailed   factors behind the company's performance, and pointed to   significantly higher comps in the coming quarters. Miller also   announced Conn's plans for expansion into a vibrant market. This   information, along with strong earnings and a healthy outlook,   propelled shares 18% higher in the afternoon trading session on   Tuesday, as investors warmed to its viability as   a consumer goods investment    for the back half of the year. Miller said:  Retail sales growth as a result of new store openings,     strong retail profitability, and favorable credit performance     drove record second-quarter earnings of $0.62 per diluted     share. Our e-commerce sales are quickly ramping, and we are     well positioned to serve our customers online as we expand our     geographic footprint. During the second half of this fiscal     year, we expect to lap the benefits Hurricane Harvey rebuilding     efforts had on same-store sales, which have impacted the     year-over-year sales comparison over the past four     quarters.        With strong operating performance and financial results, I am     excited to announce our plans to enter the Florida market next     fiscal year. We believe that the State of Florida can support     over 40 Conn's HomePlus locations once fully penetrated.     Positive momentum is accelerating across our business, and we     believe fiscal year 2020 is shaping up to be a year of strong     earnings and operational growth.  Looking forward Looking ahead to the fiscal third quarter, Conn's expects   year-over-year retail sales growth of 4% to 8%, and comps results   between a 3% decline and a 1% gain. Markets impacted by Harvey   are anticipated to post a comps decline of between 4% and 8%,   while all other markets are slated to see comps results between a   2% decline and a 2% gain. Consumer segment revenue is pegged to land in a range of $94   million to $98 million. Conn's doesn't provide forward EPS or net   income guidance, but it does outline expected SG&A expense,   which should fall between 32.25% and 33.25% of total revenue next   quarter.   10 stocks we like better than Conn's       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

2019-09-03 14:45:18,"After four red sessions in a row, the Cable bulls took a breather today post-UK Parliamentary voting. Quite surprisingly, UK PM Boris Johnson's Conservative Party lost majority in the Parliament. The leading player for the Liberal Democrats win was Phillip Lee, the former Justice Minister. In front of the PM and others in the House, Lee just crossed the floor  to leave the Tories and join the Opposition party. Notably, this has happened for the first time where the government lost the majority in office since John Major in 1997.

- Benjamin Butterworth (@benjaminbutter) September 3, 2019

Nevertheless, Phillip Lee told Sky News that he expects more Tory defections on the horizon.

On the technical side, though the overall perspective remained low, the Cable attempted a small jump, aiming to recover previously incurred losses. The MACD line and the Signal line stood below the zero line, pleasing the bears.

Earlier today, the RBA decided to keep interest rates unchanged at an all-time low of 1%. Notably, the Central Bank had already lowered the rates in June and July, catering the slow global and domestic economic growth. However, data revealed the adverse wage growth and falling Retail Sales statistics. Hence, the policymakers keep the door ajar for probable rate cuts in the coming quarters.

""The Board will continue to monitor developments, including in the labor market, and ease monetary policy further if needed,"" to support growth and inflation targets, Lowe said  in a short post-meeting statement.

Meantime, the July MoM Retail Sales reported -0.1%, missing market estimates of 0.2%.

On the technical chart, a strong push to the upside was pretty evident throughout the day. The AUD/USD pair has breached the upper boundary of the Bollinger Bands , showcasing a demand upsurge on the buyer side. Anyhow, even if the AUD/USD pair had moved further upside then, that would have immediately activated the resistances stalled near 0.6800 and 0.6822 levels.

Greenback bears took a part of the previously accumulated gains today as highly crucial August ISM Manufacturing PMI missed estimate. The market had expected this PMI data to report near 51.0 points, 0.2 points higher than the previous statistics. Anyhow, the actual figures came around 49.1 points, providing ammunition to the bears. Another pain for the US Dollar Index got triggered with the rise in the GBP/USD following the Parliamentary news.

In the interim, the Greenback had already breached above the sturdy 98.68 levels on August 30. Anyhow, the Index was heading south side on Tuesday, planning a revisit to 98.50/97.50 region.

The Swiss Franc pair was shedding gains on Tuesday following upbeat August CPI data release. Noticeably, the YoY CPI recorded 0.3% over 0.2% forecasts while the MoM CPI came around 0.0% above -0.1% estimate.

At around 16:52 GMT, the USD/CHF pair was 0.26% down, trading near 0.9872 level. Needless to say, the Parabolic SAR was still below the pair accompanying the underlying 50-day SMA. Meanwhile, strong resistance cluster comprising of 100-day and 200-day SMAs was blocking the upside. Also, the Stochastics Oscillator was indicating 80 mark, showing over-bought conditions in combination with the overhead SMAs.

Any further downside would have immediately activated the critical support handles stalled near 0.9775 and 0.9701 levels.

",Forex Daily Recap – Cable Took a Breather amid Brexit Showdown - Nasdaq.com,https://www.nasdaq.com/article/forex-daily-recap-cable-took-a-breather-amid-brexit-showdown-cm1206998
2019-09-03 07:22:40,"I learned a long time ago not to count on central banks to bail out your position. Even those with short memories recall the carnage following the Swiss National Bank’s decision to abandon its support of the EURCHF 1.20 peg January 2015

A central bank being forced out of the market after failed interventions is not new. President Trump and his advisors should study the forex history books before deciding whether to intervene to weaken the dollar,’

Let’s take a look at different types of forex intervention and which tend to be most effective.

Types of Intervention

1) Unilateral or Coordinated

Intervention can take the form of being unilateral (i.e. one central acting alone) or coordinated (i.e. various central banks acting in concert).

2) Sterilized or Unsterilized

The results of the intervention (i.e. buying or selling a currency) can be sterilized or left unsterilized. When a central bank sterilizes intervention, it offsets the impact of buying or selling its currency through intervention by adding or draining reserves from its domestic money market. When intervention is left unsterilized, the central bank allows the full impact of such actions to either increase or reduce the supply of liquidity.

3) Overt Intervention

A central bank may look for the shock effect by being visible in its forex intervention. This overt intervention may see the central bank surprise the market and come in via an electronic platform, which gets flashed across wore services. This often sees a sharp reaction in the market but the more times employed, the less impact it tends to have.

4) Covert Intervention

A central bank may prefer to keep traders guessing and intervene covertly. In this way all traders get are rumors as the intervention is not publicized.

One method of covert intervention is through the use of surrogates to buy or sell its currency. In this way it can disguise its actions and keep the market guessing. Some call this stealth intervention. There is speculation that the Japan’s MOF (Ministry of Finance) and Bank of Japan have employed this tactic for years but only insiders know whether this is true and if so, to what extent it is used.

5) Managed Float

Those countries with managed currency regimes have become a factor in intervention. In these cases, the central bank uses the proceeds from forex intervention to adjust its currency reserve basket to maintain the ratio of dollars and other currencies. Central banks often use this tactic to keep its currency from appreciating although it can work on both sides.

(Note. our Brexit poll was one of the only surveys to call the outcome dead on from the start) 

Which types of intervention tend to be most effective?

As a rule, it is easier for a central bank to intervene to slow the appreciation of its currency than to support a falling currency. Intervention tends to be more effective when accompanied by other measures, such as an increase/decrease in interest rates to make a currency more/less attractive.

Coordinated forex intervention is generally more effective than unilateral intervention in the currency market. The most notable example is the 1986 Plaza Accord, where the G-7 countries agreed to work together to drive down an overvalued USD. It is more difficult for a country, acting alone, to intervene effectively.

Unsterilized intervention is more effective than sterilized intervention. Traders look to see if central banks sterilize intervention and allow the buying or selling to increase or decrease (as the case may be) the supply of its currency. Most interventions tend to be sterilized as central banks take offsetting measures to limit the impact on domestic monetary conditions.

The more predictable a central bank is in its interventions the less the impact each time employed. This may be referred to as the law of diminishing returns as the market gets used to it and adjusts its strategies accordingly. The initial reaction to a surprise intervention tends to have the greatest impact. Traders also look to see whether the central bank intervenes at lower/higher levels or gets aggressive by continuing to buy/sell at higher/lower levels. The latter tends to see the most impact but runs a risk as once the central bank steps back the market tends to reverse some of the earlier moves.

Stealth intervention is more of a gray area. The market only suspects intervention when a central bank uses surrogates to intervene and a lot depends on how much it wants to keep the market guessing.

The Bank of Japan and Ministry of Finance tend to be secretive but the market suspects they have been employing stealth intervention for years. One reason may be that they do not want to be accused of trying to engineer an undervalued currency. Given Japan’s dependence on exports, there is suspicion that it tries to limit the JPY upside to help its exporters through stealth intervention, thereby avoiding any criticism from other trading partner countries.

Reserve Management is used with a managed float, a strategy often employed by emerging market countries to limit the appreciation of their currencies. This is especially true of periods when the dollar is weak. The way this works is a central bank buys dollars to limit its currency’s upside and then diversifies by selling some of those dollars to convert into other currencies to maintain the allocation of its reserve basket. If selling dollars to manage its float, the central bank buys back some of those dollars and sells other currencies in its reserve bask to maintain the percentage allocations and vice versa of buying dollars.

So when you hear that a central bank intervenes, you have to explore further to assess its potential impact and adjust your strategies accordingly. Is it unilateral or coordinated? Are there any additional measures taken to support the intervention? How visible is the central bank intervention? Is there stealth intervention going on? What is the impact on major currencies from intervention to maintain a managed float? These just scratch the surface but give some insights into forex intervention.

2019-09-03 10:24:00,"  RPC, Inc.  's RES  troubles seem to be never ending. The oilfield service provider, which has lost 61% of its value over the past year, is traversing rough waters amid several headwinds. Shares of RPC have declined 46.2% year to date compared with its  industry  and the energy sector's 0.2% and 5.1% fall, respectively.    Let's delve into the factors that have taken a toll on the firm. Intensified competition in the domestic market has left limited room for oilfield services companies to charge premium prices for the services being offered. Moreover, slowdown of demand for pressure pumping services in shale plays mars RPC's prospects. This is evident from second-quarter 2019 results, wherein weakness stemmed from lower activity levels and pricing in the company's pressure pumping service business, in turn significantly affecting operating income. Explorers and producers are constrained by the reduction in capacity for borrowings and an increase in the cost of capital. Also, the explorers are facing constant pressure from investors for higher returns instead of production growth. These headwinds are likely to lower investments by explorers and producers in the land market of North America. Hence, conservative spending by customers is likely to hurt demand for the company's oilfield services. Between 2017 and 2018, RPC's cost of revenues increased almost 73% and 13%, respectively, due to rise in maintenance expenses, fuel costs, and materials and supplies expenses. Although costs decreased in first-half 2019, it is expected to escalate again, with rise in activity levels. Notably, cost of revenues - as a percentage of sales - increased year over year in first-half 2019. A hike in expenses associated with the ramp-up of oilfield services hurt the company's earnings. Moderate recovery in oilfield services in the domestic market will likely lead to a further increase in costs, which is a serious concern for RPC. Although it is strongly committed toward returning cash to stockholders through dividend payments and share buybacks, the company's dividend yield is not impressive.

Sept 3 (Reuters) - Wall Street fell on Tuesday after data showed U.S. manufacturing sector contracted for the first time since 2016 in August, adding to fears that a protracted U.S.-China trade war could tip the world's largest economy into recession.

The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity decreased to 49.1, compared with a reading of 51.1 estimated by analysts polled by Reuters. 

Trade-sensitive industrials  slipped 1.77%, while technology stocks  fell 1.38%.

In an escalation of their trade war, the United States on Sunday began imposing 15% tariffs on a variety of Chinese goods, and China began imposing new duties on U.S. crude oil.

The tariffs that went into effect on Sunday are making investors increasingly cynical towards the trade war, Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York said.

The S&P 500 index fell 1.8% in August, its biggest monthly drop since May, after escalating trade tensions and the inversion of a key part of the U.S. yield curve, seen as a sign of recession, drove investors toward safe-haven assets.

However, trade tensions were dialed down last week following signals that Beijing and Washington would meet in September for talks, but Bloomberg reported on Monday that the two sides were yet to agree on a date for the planned meeting.

The energy sector  tumbled nearly 2% and was the biggest loser among the 11 major S&P sectors, as rising OPEC and Russian crude output drove a 4% slump in oil prices. O/R

Chipmakers, which draw a large portion of their revenue from China, also fell, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor index  off 2.06%.

At 10:16 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was down 391.94 points, or 1.48%, at 26,011.34, the S&P 500  was down 30.94 points, or 1.06%, at 2,895.52 and the Nasdaq Composite  was down 88.11 points, or 1.11%, at 7,874.77.

U.S. casino operators felt the brunt of slowing economic growth in China as gambling hub Macau posted an 8.6% decline in August casino revenue, sending shares of Wynn Resorts Ltd , Las Vegas Sands Corp  and MGM Resorts International  down between 3% and 4%. 

Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 2.47-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 2.65-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P index recorded 19 new 52-week highs and four new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 25 new highs and 76 new lows.","Wall Street falls on weak data, trade frictions - Nasdaq.com",https://www.nasdaq.com/article/wall-street-falls-on-weak-data-trade-frictions-20190903-00860

Are you worried that youaEURtmre going to outlive your money? ItaEURtms a fair concern with interest rates low and heading lower.

To put it bluntly, many well-off retirees are at serious risk of having to pick up a aEURoeside hustleaEUR to avoid dying broke. Passive income in the popular retirement aEURoego-tosaEUR is simply no help today, as the average S&P 500 stock pays a skimpy 1.9% now. Ten-year Treasuries? Even worse, at just 1.5%.

So unless youaEURtmve got $2.1 million laying around to invest in the typical blue chip stockaEUR""enough to get you a $40,000 annual dividend streamaEUR""youaEURtmll likely have to sell some of your stocks to supplement your dividend income.

ThataEURtms a very dangerous course right now, because of this:

aEURoeRecession AlertaEUR Turns Red

WeaEURtmre looking at the yield on the 2-year Treasury note (in orange) and the yield on the 10-year (blue). When these yields aEURoeinvertaEURaEUR""as they are nowaEUR""theyaEURtmre the canary in the coal mine: this setup has predicted the last seven recessions.

Millions of Retirees About to Get Hit

This indicator is putting millions of retirees on notice. But many will ignore it because they follow a strategy their adviser says is safe, but is, in fact, anything but.

ThataEURtms the aEURoe4% rule.aEUR You know the one: where you withdraw up to 4% of your portfolio a year to supplement your dividend income.

Sounds reasonable, right? Well, I hope you havenaEURtmt fallen into this trap. Because the 4% fiasco can only magnify your losses (and crush your income) when you hit a patch like this:

The 4% Rule Slams Into Reality

This is a snapshot of Apple ( AAPL ) stockaEURtms 33% plunge during the late 2018 correction, which was much worse than the 20% fall in the market as a whole.

If you were following the 4% rule, you were forced to withdraw money at exactly the wrong time. AppleaEURtms dividend was fine (in fact, the company announced a big hike a few months before the meltdown). But you still needed to sell shares for more income.

Remember the benefits of dollar-cost averaging that built your retirement portfolio? This is the same, but in reverse! YouaEURtmre selling more shares when prices are lowaEUR""which hurts your income stream even moreaEUR""and fewer when prices are high .

ItaEURtms a aEURoeretirement death spiralaEUR with one outcome: outliving your money!

The Solution: aEURoePullback-ProofaEUR Dividends

Instead of Wall StreetaEURtms flawed 4% rule, weaEURtmre going to transition your nest egg into what I call aEURoepullback-proofaEUR dividends. These stout dividend payers have two critical strengths that protect and grow your savings no matter what:

LetaEURtms dive into two dividends that tick these boxes. IaEURtmm zeroing in on these two because between them, they give you a ton of diversification, with real estate investment trusts (REITs) , blue chip stocks and high-yielding preferred stocks.

Pick No. 1: Tap This aEURoeInvestor Blind SpotaEUR for Big Gains (and 6.5% Dividends)

Like the proverbial generals fighting the last war, many folks simply wonaEURtmt touch real estate, because it triggered the aEURtm08/aEURtm09 crisis.

ThataEURtms too bad, because theyaEURtmre missing out on one of the steadiest, highest-yielding corners of the market. Right now, the benchmark Vanguard Real Estate ETF ( VNQ ), yields 3.3%, nearly double the typical S&P 500 name.

WhataEURtms more, in the late-2018 crash, REITs fell half as much as stocks. And because of REITsaEURtm higher dividends, owners of these stocks had far less need to sell into the downturn:

Understanding the Prospects of Zero Trust Model    Notably, per a ResearchAndMarkets report, the Global Cloud Security market  is expected to hit $241.1 billion by 2025, at a CAGR of 11% from 2019 to 2025.    However, the firm notes that lack of awareness about cloud security the small and medium organizations and fear of losing confidentiality are some factors restraining market growth.    Per IHS Markit survey authorized by Fortinet FTNT  , 74% of respondents have moved their applications back to private infrastructure from the cloud due to security concerns.  Year-To-Date Price Performance       Traditional security models operate under the view that everything within an organization's network can be trusted. However, with technology such as AI and ML being increasingly adopted and integrated into various phases of business process, cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated.    Moreover, inside attacks on sensitive data are increasing at a rapid pace than standard security controls can keep up. Per Verizon DBIR  2019, 34% of cyber-attacks were committed by insiders.    Thus, adopting new security practices that can stop threats from spreading once within an organization's network is the need of the hour.    In the Zero Trust approach to cybersecurity, the network and the vulnerabilities are assumed to be constantly evolving and indiscernible. This means that perimeter security is no longer enough to protect the organization. A core tenet of Zero Trust is to keep a lookout for malicious activities in all internal and external traffic, and identify the areas of improvement. Summing up, the model follows one rule - ""Never Trust, Always Verify"".    Usually, when a company inks a deal with a cloud vendor, it often thinks that the security aspect will also be taken care of by the vendor, which is not the case. This is where companies need to invest in deals with separate security vendors.   5 Security Stocks to Gain From Zero Trust Model    Security vendors are constantly upping their efforts to tap the aforesaid areas of concern and cash in on the lucrative opportunities. They are increasingly trying to enhance the performance of organizations in a hybrid cloud environment, while maintaining their ability to manage risks.    Let's take a look at the five cyber security stocks that are actively working in tandem with the Zero Trust model to secure the cloud better:   Fortinet  is benefiting from growing demand for its Security Fabric architecture and a broad range of hybrid and multi-cloud deployments. Notably, the Security Fabric suit is based on the Zero Trust policy.    Recently, the company announced that FortiGate-VM, which is powered by the Fortinet Security Fabric, will support the VMware NSX-T Data Center to help customers consolidate security infrastructure and extend it across multi-hypervisor environments, public and private clouds.

In the current security scenario, where enterprises are transitioning their workloads and data to the cloud, every point on the network is vulnerable to security breaches.    makeArticleAd();  With growing migration of workloads to the cloud, sensitive business data is constantly transferred between SaaS applications, IaaS, data centers, remote users, IoT devices, and like, giving cyber-criminals access to wider attack surfaces and more points of entry.   Understanding the Prospects of Zero Trust Model    Notably, per a ResearchAndMarkets report, the Global Cloud Security market  is expected to hit $241.1 billion by 2025, at a CAGR of 11% from 2019 to 2025.    However, the firm notes that lack of awareness about cloud security the small and medium organizations and fear of losing confidentiality are some factors restraining market growth.    Per IHS Markit survey authorized by Fortinet FTNT  , 74% of respondents have moved their applications back to private infrastructure from the cloud due to security concerns.

 Year-To-Date Price Performance 

     Traditional security models operate under the view that everything within an organization's network can be trusted. However, with technology such as AI and ML being increasingly adopted and integrated into various phases of business process, cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated.    Moreover, inside attacks on sensitive data are increasing at a rapid pace than standard security controls can keep up. Per Verizon DBIR  2019, 34% of cyber-attacks were committed by insiders.    Thus, adopting new security practices that can stop threats from spreading once within an organization's network is the need of the hour.    In the Zero Trust approach to cybersecurity, the network and the vulnerabilities are assumed to be constantly evolving and indiscernible.

2019-09-03 07:40:27,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

For years, International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM ) has offered declining revenue but decent earnings per share that were boosted by the company's voracious appetite for buying back its own stock. While buybacks are often applauded, Wall Street eventually saw through that act and demanded more from IBM stock.

Up nearly 19% year-to-date, it's fair to say IBM stock is on the mend, but not all the way back. Highly creative and nimble technology companies are often viewed as ""transformative."" While that label probably doesn't apply to IBM, Big Blue is undergoing a transformation aimed at rejuvenating the company's growth and boosting IBM stock price.

Analysts are mostly bullish on the company's recently closed acquisition of Red Hat and see the deal as a potential bullish catalyst for IBM stock price. Of course, the company paints a bullish picture of the deal, telling analysts and investors that it will be able to sell more IBM products to Red Hat users and vice versa.

""IBM said the deal will boost second half 2019 revenues by about 2 percentage points; 2020 by 4-5 percentage points; and 2021 by 2-3 percentage points,"" according to Barron's.

Moreover, the Red Hat purchase will bolster IBM's free cash flow. That, in turn, could enable IBM to return more money to the owners of IBM stock.   Over the years, IBM stock has been pretty dependable on that front. In addition to IBM being a dedicated buyer of its own shares, the dividend of IBM stock has steadily grown and currently yields 4.94%, more than triple the yield on 10-year Treasuries.

While IBM stock is widely viewed as a mature, if not lumbering, technology name, the company has a formidable presence in the fast-growing blockchain and is a worthy cloud competitor.  Cloud computing is certainly growing, but IBM is behind rivals such as Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Microsoft  (NASDAQ: MSFT ) in the cloud-computing arena.

""Though still in the early stages, we think investments in IBM Cloud (a combination of SoftLayer and Bluemix); acquisition of Red Hat; establishment of development platforms like Watson Developer Cloud; and enterprise application partnerships with leading global companies present positive opportunities for IBM,"" said Morningstar in a recent note. ""Still, more work remains to be done.""

In the cloud space, IBM likely needs to sharpen its focus on software-as-a-service, also a hyper-competitive environment. With IBM facing intense competition in its hardware business from rivals, such as Oracle (NYSE: ORCL ) and Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ), software-as-a-service has become more important for IBM stock.

""Cloud computing and increasing competitive pressures from Oracle and Cisco will pressure IBM's systems segment,"" said Morningstar . ""We expect secular headwinds and intense competition to hinder the growth of IBM's hardware business over the long term. On average, we forecast a small annual decline in revenue for this segment through 2023.""

As for blockchain, a space where IBM has meaningful advantages over its competitors, the company recently unveiled its Trust Your Supplier (TYS) network. TYS is aimed at improving ""supplier qualification, validation, onboarding and life cycle information management"" for corporate customers.

That's a lot of tech jargon. What it really means is the platform helps companies track the movement of goods and services. That could be a $2 trillion industry in a few years. TYS could easily attract many customers if its promises of improving administrative cost and onboarding efficiencies are realized. In the corporate world, ""efficiencies"" usually mean cost savings, and executives love that.

There are positive aspects of the outlook of IBM stock. That outlook would grow more compelling if the Red Hat acquisition proves to be a better deal than previously believed. Currently, Red Hat is an ""add on"" to the positive thesis on IBM stock. But if the acquired company exceeds Wall Street's expectations, IBM stock could rally.

IBM stock price could also climb if the company increases its footprint in the SaaS market. Trading at just 10.53 times the average forward earnings estimate, IBM is most definitely a value play in a sector in which investors are looking for growth. Moreover, even mature companies (see Microsoft) are delivering growth in the SaaS sector.

IBM stock lacks the pizzazz of many equities in its sector, explaining its low multiples. That's all right as long as investors can wait for value stocks to come back into style, something that hasn't happened in over a decade.

As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-03 12:03:00,"You'd think that by now, investors would be used to the ups and downs of the stock market . Yet even though the returns that most major indexes have produced over the past 10 years have been nothing short of amazing, sometimes all it takes is a single piece of concerning news to send investors into a near-panic.

One way to gauge how ordinary investors are reacting to current events and market conditions is by looking at the American Association of Individual Investors and its weekly survey of market sentiment. Thousands of members have the opportunity every week to answer whether they believe that the stock market will be higher, lower, or roughly in the same place six months from now.

As you can see below, the survey results over the past couple of months have seen a decided shift toward fear about the future direction of the market.

Data source: American Association of Individual Investors. Chart by author. Note: Numbers don't add to 100% because chart omits neutral responses.

Throughout much of 2019, the stock market has made its biggest moves in response to developments in trade negotiations between the U.S. and China. In early August, the Trump administration decided to impose new tariffs on another $300 billion in imported Chinese goods, killing hopes that the two nations would find a quicker solution to their dispute. That led to an abrupt shift in sentiment and raised fears of a possible recession.

Many of the biggest drops in stock market history have happened in September and October, including the crashes in 1929 and 1987, as well as much of the drop associated with the financial crisis in 2008. It's therefore unsurprising to see investors ratchet down their expectations as the autumn months approach.

Yet the good news for those watching the AAII numbers is that the sentiment indicators have largely become a contrarian sign. When bearish sentiment is at its highest, markets tend to react positively, and it's only when investors get the most optimistic that they find themselves vulnerable to downturns. Of course, anything can happen in the span of a month or two, but market participants already know about many of the dangers they face and can plan accordingly to protect themselves and their portfolios .

2019-09-03 17:26:00," It was a week where both oil and  natural gas prices  settled higher. On the news front, London-based oil major BP plc BP  farmed out of Alaska, selling its entire business to Hilcorp Energy for $5.6 billion, while Norway's Equinor EQNR  indicated an earlier-than-expected start-up of the giant Johan Sverdrup field. Overall, it was a good week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 1.7% to close at $55.10 per barrel, while natural gas prices moved up 6.2% for the week to finish at 2.285 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last 'Oil & Gas Stock Roundup' here:  TechnipFMC's Spin-Off, Kinder Morgan's Asset Sale & More  ) The U.S. crude benchmark notched a gain after U.S. government data showed a crude stockpile draw twice above expectations. The decline in oil inventories was the largest in the U.S. in five weeks, and came in tandem with a fall in gasoline and distillate supplies. Natural gas prices were up even as weekly inventory release showed a larger-than-expected increase in supplies. The commodity got a lift from possible production disruptions associated with Hurricane Dorian.   Recap of the Week's Most Important Stories  1.  BP announced that it has signed an accord with Hilcorp Energy Co. to divest all its assets in Alaska. The transaction has been valued at $5.6 billion. With the deal's closure by 2020, awaiting approvals from the state and federal bodies, BP will exit Alaskan operations after 60 long years. Precisely, the assets to be divested entails BP's entire upstream and midstream operations in Alaska. This includes the British energy giant's stake in the Prudhoe Bay - the largest oil field in North America - and the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System - spreading over 800 miles and transporting oil to the Port of Valdez. Investors should know that in the short term, BP will be getting $4 billion of the total transaction value. The company will receive the additional $1.6 billion once the buyer attains certain financial goals from this asset. Previously, Alaska was competing with some OPEC members, when the U.S. state pumped crude volumes at a rate of two million barrels every day. However, Alaska has lost its appeal and is presently the sixth largest oil-producing state in the United States.

The field production start-up is likely to commence operations in October, a month earlier than planned. It is one of the largest discoveries on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) is estimated to have supplies attributed to 2.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The giant oil field's day-to-day production is likely to be 440,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd) whereas its peak output is projected to soar 660,000 bpd, accounting for 25% of Norway's total petroleum production. Per a trading source, the first shipment for Sverdrup oil filed will comprise 11 cargoes in the starting month, resulting in average shipping of 226,000 barrels per day.

The headline price includes SRC Energy's estimated debt load worth $685 million. The all-stock transaction bid will be dealt at a fixed exchange ratio of 0.158 PDC Energy shares for each share of SRC Energy's stock. This represents a 4% discount to SRC Energy's closing share price on Aug 23, thus valuing the asset at $3.99 a share. Following the announcement of the deal, shares of PDC Energy and SRC Energy rallied 16.8% and 11.8%, respectively. After the culmination of the transaction later this year, current stockholders of PDC Energy will own 62% stake in the combined entity while the rest will be held by the SRC shareholders. PDC Energy will emerge as the second-largest oil producer in the Denver-Julesburg Basin behind Houston-based Occidental Petroleum at the top to go with its existing Permian acreage, if this deal gets through. The consolidated company is anticipated to incur G&A savings of $40 million in 2020 and $50 million in 2021. (Read more PDC Energy to Buy SRC Energy, Bolster Presence in DJ Basin  ) 4.   Eni S.p.A. E  recently announced a huge discovery of gas and condensate onshore Nigeria. The reserves are estimated to have around 1 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of gas and 60 million barrels of associated condensate. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company found the hydrocarbon deposit in Obiafu-Obrikom fields, which are located in Niger Delta's OML61. You can see   the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here   . The discovery was made in the Obiafu-41 deep well that hit more than 130 meters of superior quality hydrocarbon-bearing sands of Oligocene age. Eni will conduct an appraisal campaign at the site to gauge further potential of the discovery. The company expects to bring the well online immediately, which can boost its gas production volumes. The well is estimated to deliver more than 100 million standard Cf of natural gas and 3,000 barrels of associated condensates per day. Notably, in 2018, Eni's equity gas output volumes in Nigeria amounted to 92 billion Cf, which constituted around 5% of the country's total production. The company, which has operations in the country since 1962, is expected to further increase its footprint therein with the latest discovery. With the growing popularity of cleaner energy sources around the globe, the natural gas discovery can be fruitful for the company.

This shareholder-friendly move puts the stock on offer to dividend-seeking investors and is expected to boost the sentiments of existing stockholders. The company's board of directors has green signaled the clearance of a dividend of 3 cents per share on its Class A Common Stock. Headquartered in Austin, TX, this oil and gas E&P company's declaration of its first cash dividend reflects its willingness to return funds to its shareholders. The payout translates to 12 cents per share (or $34 million) on an annualized basis. However, its allocation is negligible from an yield standpoint at just 0.7%, lower than the industry average of 1.4%. The dividend is likely to be paid out on Sep 30 this year to stockholders of record as of Sep 20, 2019. The dividend announcement is supported by the company's target to generate significant free cash flow from its operations during the second half of 2019. Notably, Parsley Energy is focused on strengthening its balance sheet to gain financial flexibility.(Read more  Parsley Energy Rewards Investors With Dividend Initiation  )  Price Performance  The following table shows the price movement of some the major oil and gas players over the past week and during the last 6 months.  The Energy Select Sector SPDR - a popular way to track energy companies - was up 2.7% last week. The best performer was independent refining giant Marathon Petroleum MPC  whose stock rose 7.5%. Longer-term, over six months, the sector tracker is down 13.7%. Offshore driller Transocean Ltd. was the major loser during this period, experiencing a 47.4% price plunge.

After the culmination of the transaction later this year, current stockholders of PDC Energy will own 62% stake in the combined entity while the rest will be held by the SRC shareholders.

PDC Energy will emerge as the second-largest oil producer in the Denver-Julesburg Basin behind Houston-based Occidental Petroleum at the top to go with its existing Permian acreage, if this deal gets through. The consolidated company is anticipated to incur G&A savings of $40 million in 2020 and $50 million in 2021. (Read more PDC Energy to Buy SRC Energy, Bolster Presence in DJ Basin  )

4.   Eni S.p.A. E  recently announced a huge discovery of gas and condensate onshore Nigeria. The reserves are estimated to have around 1 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of gas and 60 million barrels of associated condensate. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company found the hydrocarbon deposit in Obiafu-Obrikom fields, which are located in Niger Delta's OML61.

You can see   the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here   .

The discovery was made in the Obiafu-41 deep well that hit more than 130 meters of superior quality hydrocarbon-bearing sands of Oligocene age. Eni will conduct an appraisal campaign at the site to gauge further potential of the discovery. The company expects to bring the well online immediately, which can boost its gas production volumes. The well is estimated to deliver more than 100 million standard Cf of natural gas and 3,000 barrels of associated condensates per day.

Notably, in 2018, Eni's equity gas output volumes in Nigeria amounted to 92 billion Cf, which constituted around 5% of the country's total production. The company, which has operations in the country since 1962, is expected to further increase its footprint therein with the latest discovery. With the growing popularity of cleaner energy sources around the globe, the natural gas discovery can be fruitful for the company.

5.    Parsley Energy  PE   ) recently announced the initiation of a quarterly dividend. This shareholder-friendly move puts the stock on offer to dividend-seeking investors and is expected to boost the sentiments of existing stockholders. The company's board of directors has green signaled the clearance of a dividend of 3 cents per share on its Class A Common Stock.

Headquartered in Austin, TX, this oil and gas E&P company's declaration of its first cash dividend reflects its willingness to return funds to its shareholders. The payout translates to 12 cents per share (or $34 million) on an annualized basis. However, its allocation is negligible from an yield standpoint at just 0.7%, lower than the industry average of 1.4%. The dividend is likely to be paid out on Sep 30 this year to stockholders of record as of Sep 20, 2019.

The dividend announcement is supported by the company's target to generate significant free cash flow from its operations during the second half of 2019. Notably, Parsley Energy is focused on strengthening its balance sheet to gain financial flexibility.(Read more  Parsley Energy Rewards Investors With Dividend Initiation  )

LIMA, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The Peruvian government is evaluating a proposal by state-owned energy company Petroperu to transfer about $1 billion of the company's debt to the public treasury, the finance minister said on Tuesday.

""What's been proposed is simply that within the state, instead of the public company (assuming the debt), it'd be the treasury,"" Finance Minister Carlos Oliva told journalists.

The action could make it easier for Petroperu to issue new bonds if needed as it tries to close the financing gap for a $4.7 billion expansion of its Talara refinery and pay down debt stemming from the project, which started in 2014.

Petroperu has also proposed selling 10% to 15% of its shares through a private placement offering next year, and selling assets at Talara to raise some $800 million, the president of the company said last week. 

Petroperu has already sold $2 billion in dollar-denominated bonds and secured a $1.3 billion loan from Spanish state-backed insurer Cesce to pay for the expansion at Talara.",Peru government considers taking on $1 bln of Petroperu debt -finance minister - Nasdaq.com,https://www.nasdaq.com/article/peru-government-considers-taking-on-1-bln-of-petroperu-debt-finance-minister-20190903-01007

NEW YORK, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The dollar climbed on Tuesday to its strongest level in over two years against a basket of currencies as traders favored the greenback on worries about U.S.-China trade tensions and a chaotic British exit from the European Union.

The dollar's initial gains abated in the wake of a private report that showed the U.S. manufacturing sector recorded its first monthly contraction since 2016 in August. 

""This is a safe-haven trade rather than a rate-differential trade,"" said Steven Englander, global head of G10 FX research at Standard Chartered in New York.

Bloomberg News reported that Chinese and U.S. officials are struggling to agree on a schedule for a round of trade negotiations that had been expected this month.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson lost his working majority in parliament when one of his Conservative lawmakers defected to the pro-European Union Liberal Democrats. 

At 11:44 a.m. (1544 GMT), an index that tracks the dollar versus six major currencies  was up 0.11% at 99.022. It hit 99.37 earlier Tuesday, which was its highest since May 2017.

The euro stabilized after tumbling to a 28-month low against the dollar earlier Tuesday as investors priced in deeper negative interest rates for longer in the euro zone.

Money markets have increased to more than 80% the probability that the European Central Bank will cut its benchmark rate by 20 basis points when it meets next week.

The ECB benchmark rate now stands at minus 0.40% and it has  all but promised a monetary policy stimulus package as economic growth falters. Monday's PMI survey showed European manufacturing contracted for seven straight months.

The euro  was little changed on the day at  $1.09645. It fell to $1.0926 earlier, its lowest since mid-May 2017. A break below the key $1.1000 level last week had sparked heavier sell-offs.

The dollar weakened against the yen and the Swiss franc in the aftermath of disappointing ISM manufacturing data.

The greenback fell 0.37% to 105.87 yen and decreased 0.31% to 0.98735 franc.

Sterling was last up 0.2% at $1.2087 after falling to $1.1959, the lowest since October 2016, when it plunged to $1.1491 in a flash crash. Against the euro, sterling rose to  90.7 pence, rebounding from a two-week low of 91.47 pence .

2019-09-03 13:49:45,"In trading on Tuesday, shares of SM Energy Co. (Symbol: SM) touched a new 52-week low of $8.46/share. That's a $25.30 share price drop, or -74.94% decline from the 52-week high of $33.76 set back on 10/04/2018. Large percentage drops always require that the stock post even larger percentage gains from the low in order to recover the old price point, and for SM that means the stock would have to gain 299.05% to get back to the 52-week high. For a move like that, SM Energy Co. would need fundamental strength at the business level. Here's a rhetorical question: Who knows more about fundamentals at the business level than the company's own insiders? So let's take a look to see whether any company insiders were taking the other side of the trade as SM shares were being sold down to this new 52-week low, focusing on the most recent trailing six month period. As summarized by the table below, SM has seen 3 different instances of insiders buying over the past six months.     makeArticleAd();  In the short run, while the new 52-week low suggests the stock is at the cheapest price and perhaps therefore the best bargain it has been over the last 52 weeks, the low print also means anyone who has purchased the stock over that timeframe is staring at an unrealized loss. Oftentimes, that factor drives a stock's technical analysis metrics by creating overhead resistance, with investors who bought higher now anxious to reverse their trade once they are back to breakeven. The chart below shows where SM has traded over the past year, with the 50-day and 200-day moving averages included.       Time will tell whether the insider purchases foretell a future rebound for SM shares, which are presently showing a last trade of $8.86/share, slightly above the new 52-week low.

SAO PAULO, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Brazilian automaker CAOA reached an initial agreement to buy Ford Motor Co's plant in Sao Bernardo do Campo, the companies said on Tuesday, but CAOA could slash 1,300 jobs, according to the union representing the plant's workers. 

Ford announced in February that it would shut down the plant, its oldest in Brazil, which employs some 3,000 workers, as part of a global restructuring and a push to exit the heavy truck business. 

Wagner Santana, president of the union that represents Ford's workers, told reporters that in conversations with CAOA, the Brazilian automaker said it would initially retain only some 800 workers and that 1,300 would be let go, with the remainder being kept by Ford. 

Doria has defended Sao Paulo as a manufacturing hub at a time when the auto industry turned to other Brazilian states that were offering aggressive tax incentives. He has introduced a tax incentive of his own. 

At the news conference, Doria said a decision on how many jobs will be kept can only be made once Ford and CAOA close the sale, which is set to go through a 45-day due diligence process. 

""Preserve all jobs, that's the fundamental condition for a contribution from the state,"" Doria said, in reference to potential tax benefits. 

Santana said CAOA plans to pay those it hires up to 80% of their current Ford salaries, noting that is still much more than salaries paid in other states. 

A CAOA spokesperson declined to comment.  

""The objective is to make the factory profitable and productive, so it generates employment and riches,"" said Carlos Alberto Oliveira Andrade, CAOA's president and founder, whose initials make up the company name. 

Brazil's large domestic market and protectionist economy has long attracted the world's biggest automakers to set up shop here, and CAOA is the rare carmaker that is actually domestically owned. It has struck deals to make cars for Korea's Hyundai and co-owns China's Chery operation in Brazil, whose cars are branded as CAOA Chery.

Ford opened the plant in 1967, and it is the company's oldest in the country. It was primarily used to make heavy trucks, as well as the compact Ford Fiesta, a sales laggard. Ford is undergoing a global restructuring and has said it would focus on a much newer plant in the Northeastern state of Bahia.","Ford finds buyer for Brazil plant, but new owner could cut 1,300 jobs - Nasdaq.com",https://www.nasdaq.com/article/ford-finds-buyer-for-brazil-plant-but-new-owner-could-cut-1300-jobs-20190903-01214

The company has a balanced capital allocation strategy. Repaying debts, improving organic growth opportunities, reducing costs and share buybacks are the main areas where capital is used. Notably, the company used $383 million for repaying long-term debts in the first three quarters of fiscal 2019. Higher cash flow will effectively support the company's capital-allocation strategies. For fiscal 2019 (ending September 2019), its adjusted free cash flow is predicted to be $670 million. Moreover, for fiscal 2020 (ending September 2020), the company anticipates cash flow from operations of $1,400 million, capital expenditure of $600 million and free cash flow of $800 million.

Sept 3 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday as datashowed factory activity shrank for the first time since 2016 inAugust, renewing fears that a drawn-out trade war between theUnited States and China could tip the world's largest economyinto recession.    

The Institute for Supply Management said its index ofnational factory activity dropped to 49.1, compared with areading of 51.1 estimated by analysts polled by Reuters.  urn:newsml:reuters.com:*:nL2N25R073

The weak data also pushed the benchmark 10-year yield US10YT=RR to its lowest level since July 2016. Shares of banks .SPXBK , which typically come under pressure in a low interestrate environment, slid 2%.

""Sentiment was already poor to start the day and then theweaker-than-expected manufacturing data just added fuel to thefire,"" said Dave Mazza, managing director and head of product atasset management firm Direxion in New York. 

""We now have confirmation that the escalation in the tradewar has spilled over to U.S. manufacturing just as it has tomanufacturing around the globe,"" he added.

U.S. stocks started the day on weak footing as Washingtonand Beijing kicked off a new round of tariffs over the weekend,worrying investors who see no signs of an early resolution tothe long-running trade war, which has rattled markets for monthsand weighed on world economies.

Investors will also keep a close watch on the monthly jobsreport due on Friday, which is expected to offer clues on thelikelihood of another rate cut from the Federal Reserve at itsmid-September meeting.

The disappointing manufacturing data is not out of sync withthe market's expectation of a 25 basis point rate cut this monthbut weaker-than-expected non-manufacturing data may change thecentral bank's perspective on cutting rates further, Mazza said.

ZURICH, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Britain'sBarclays  and Switzerland'sJulius Baer  have targeted Credit Suisse's  International Wealth Management business, which in July saw the departure of its head Iqbal Khan, to hire a total of 14 bankers.

Barclays, which has set its sights on hiring and expanding its private banking business in Switzerland, announced six new Zurich hires on Tuesday, three of whom will help launch a new Israel desk out of the Swiss financial hub. 

""We've been looking for the best talent in order to support our growth ambition in Switzerland and capture the opportunities provided by a financial centre such as Zurich,"" Barclays Swiss head, Gerald Mathieu, said.

Julius Baer, meanwhile, said in a statement it had employed 10 former Credit Suisse wealth managers to develop its Portuguese business out of Madrid, with José Maria do Cazal-Ribeiro becoming market head for the country.

""The hire of this comprehensive senior team demonstrates our long-term commitment to growing market Portugal,"" Baer's head of western Europe, Carlos Recoder, said in a statement, adding the bank considered Portugal a strategic market to be further developed and was committed to investing in its growth.

Credit Suisse said its new Portugal team was in place and  unchanged in size, reflecting its commitment to the market where it has grown steadily since launching a Lisbon branch in 2013.

Switzerland's second-largest bank said its Israeli market area had also seen strong growth. ""Credit Suisse is fully committed to Israel and our Israeli clients and will continue to grow and invest in this key market,"" a spokesperson said.

Credit Suisse confirmed the departures, which it said dated from well before the summer.","Barclays, Julius Baer bolster wealth business with ex-Credit Suisse bankers - Nasdaq.com",https://www.nasdaq.com/article/barclays-julius-baer-bolster-wealth-business-with-excredit-suisse-bankers-20190903-00554

The company is likely to benefit from margin improvement, strategic investment in products, technology, and a solid capital-allocation plan.  makeArticleAd();  AGCO's second-quarter 2019 adjusted earnings per share were up 37.8% year over year to $1.82. The reported figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.59. The company witnessed impressive margin expansion across all regions and significan t earnings  per share growth during the April-June quarter.   Upbeat 2019 Prospects    AGCO anticipates gross and operating margins improvement from the 2018 levels, as the positive impact of pricing and benefits from cost-reduction initiatives will likely negate the impact of a softer market outlook for the North and South America segment.

Considering these, AGCO now forecasts 2019 adjusted earnings per share of $5.10, up from the previous estimate of $4.90.   Strategic Investments Support AGCO    AGCO is consistently making strategic investments to enhance and expand its product lines, upgrade system capabilities as well as improve factory productivity. In a bid to execute its product-development plan and meet the latest emission requirements in Brazil and Europe, the company intends to increase the investment level in 2019. Consequently, AGCO expects current-year capital expenditures of roughly $225 million, up from the $203 million reported in 2018.   Acquisitions to Boost Growth    AGCO has completed two acquisitions in the last two years. In September 2017, it acquired Precision Planting - a leader in innovative planting technology. In October 2017, AGCO purchased the forage division of Lely Group, which will significantly boost its hay and forage product line in Europe, fueling growth in this market.   Solid Capital-Allocation Plan Bodes Well    AGCO is focused on its long-term capital allocation plan by returning cash to shareholders. Over the past six years, the company executed share repurchases of $1.3 billion, which reduced share count by more than 25%. In the first six months of 2019, it repurchased shares worth $70 million. The company expects to generate free cash flow of $275-$300 million for 2019. This year, AGCO increased its quarterly dividend by 7% to 16 cents per share.

2019-09-03 10:15:00," The month of August was highly volatile for the U.S. stock market marked by an escalation in U.S.-China trade relations, a slowing global economy and a recession signal being flashed by the inversion of the yield curve. Weak global economic data, low inflation and political unrest in Hong Kong added to the chaos.  makeArticleAd();  However, hopes of monetary easing globally and positive trade developments continued to provide some support in between (read: August ETF Events That Grab Headlines  ).    Notably, the Dow dropped 1.7%, the S&P 500 shed 1.8% and the Nasdaq lost 2.6% last month. The Russell 2000 Index took the heaviest losses for the month, falling 5.1%. In fact, the S&P 500 posted 11 moves of more than 1% in 22 trading sessions for August. Those moves included three declines of at least 2.6% as well as the index's worst day of the year on Aug 5, per CNBC  .    Against this backdrop, investors are rushing to leveraged or inverse leveraged ETFs to increase returns on quick market turns in a short span. These products either create a leveraged long/short position, an inverse long/short position or a leveraged inverse long/short position in the underlying index through the use of swaps, options, future contracts and other financial instruments. Due to their compounding effect, investors can enjoy higher returns in a very short period of time provided the trend remains a friend.    However, these funds run the risk of huge losses compared to traditional funds in fluctuating or seesawing markets. Further, their performances could vary significantly from the actual performance of their underlying index over a longer period when compared to a shorter period (such as, weeks or months).    Still, we have highlighted five leveraged/inverse products that have gained in double digits in August though these involve a great deal of risk when compared to traditional products. This trend might continue at least in the near term provided the sentiments remain the same (see: all Leveraged Equity ETFs here  ).   Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X Shares NUGT  - Up 21%    NUGT provides three times exposure to the daily performance of the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index. It charges 91 bps in annual fees and has amassed $1.6 billion in its asset base. Volume is heavy, with around 9.7 million shares exchanged per day on average (read: 5 Gold Mining ETFs & Stocks Shining in August  ).   Direxion Daily Natural Gas Related Bear 3X Shares GASX  - Up 17.3%    This product provides three times inverse exposure to the ISE-Revere Natural Gas Index. It has amassed $9.6 million in its asset base and trades in solid volume of 25,000 shares a day on average. The ETF charges 95 bps in fees per year.   Direxion Daily S&P Oil & Gas Exp. & Prod. Bear 3X Shares DRIP  - Up 15.2%    This fund seeks three times inverse exposure of the performance of the S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production Select Industry Index. DRIP has accumulated $41.6 million in its asset base and trades in solid volume of more than 718,000 shares a day on average. The fund charges 95 bps in annual fees.   Direxion Daily Aerospace & Defense Bull 3X Shares DFEN  - Up 14%    The fund creates three times leveraged long position in the Dow Jones U.S. Select Aerospace & Defense Index. It charges an annual fee of 95 bps and trades in good average daily volume of about 59,000 shares. The fund has accumulated AUM of $54.8 million.   Direxion Daily Homebuilders & Supplies Bull 3X Shares NAIL  - Up 12.9%    NAIL provides leveraged exposure to homebuilders and creates a three times long position in the Dow Jones U.S. Select Home Construction Index. It charges an annual fee of 95 bps and trades in average daily volume of about 55,000 shares. The fund has accumulated $43.6 million in its asset base (read: Housing ETFs & Stocks to Buy on Likely September Rate Cut  ).

Weak global economic data, low inflation and political unrest in Hong Kong added to the chaos.  makeArticleAd();  However, hopes of monetary easing globally and positive trade developments continued to provide some support in between (read: August ETF Events That Grab Headlines  ).    Notably, the Dow dropped 1.7%, the S&P 500 shed 1.8% and the Nasdaq lost 2.6% last month. The Russell 2000 Index took the heaviest losses for the month, falling 5.1%. In fact, the S&P 500 posted 11 moves of more than 1% in 22 trading sessions for August. Those moves included three declines of at least 2.6% as well as the index's worst day of the year on Aug 5, per CNBC  .    Against this backdrop, investors are rushing to leveraged or inverse leveraged ETFs to increase returns on quick market turns in a short span. These products either create a leveraged long/short position, an inverse long/short position or a leveraged inverse long/short position in the underlying index through the use of swaps, options, future contracts and other financial instruments. Due to their compounding effect, investors can enjoy higher returns in a very short period of time provided the trend remains a friend.    However, these funds run the risk of huge losses compared to traditional funds in fluctuating or seesawing markets. Further, their performances could vary significantly from the actual performance of their underlying index over a longer period when compared to a shorter period (such as, weeks or months).    Still, we have highlighted five leveraged/inverse products that have gained in double digits in August though these involve a great deal of risk when compared to traditional products. This trend might continue at least in the near term provided the sentiments remain the same (see: all Leveraged Equity ETFs here  ).   Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X Shares NUGT  - Up 21%    NUGT provides three times exposure to the daily performance of the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index. It charges 91 bps in annual fees and has amassed $1.6 billion in its asset base. Volume is heavy, with around 9.7 million shares exchanged per day on average (read: 5 Gold Mining ETFs & Stocks Shining in August  ).   Direxion Daily Natural Gas Related Bear 3X Shares GASX  - Up 17.3%    This product provides three times inverse exposure to the ISE-Revere Natural Gas Index. It has amassed $9.6 million in its asset base and trades in solid volume of 25,000 shares a day on average. The ETF charges 95 bps in fees per year.   Direxion Daily S&P Oil & Gas Exp. & Prod. Bear 3X Shares DRIP  - Up 15.2%    This fund seeks three times inverse exposure of the performance of the S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production Select Industry Index. DRIP has accumulated $41.6 million in its asset base and trades in solid volume of more than 718,000 shares a day on average. The fund charges 95 bps in annual fees.   Direxion Daily Aerospace & Defense Bull 3X Shares DFEN  - Up 14%    The fund creates three times leveraged long position in the Dow Jones U.S. Select Aerospace & Defense Index. It charges an annual fee of 95 bps and trades in good average daily volume of about 59,000 shares. The fund has accumulated AUM of $54.8 million.   Direxion Daily Homebuilders & Supplies Bull 3X Shares NAIL  - Up 12.9%    NAIL provides leveraged exposure to homebuilders and creates a three times long position in the Dow Jones U.S. Select Home Construction Index. It charges an annual fee of 95 bps and trades in average daily volume of about 55,000 shares. The fund has accumulated $43.6 million in its asset base (read: Housing ETFs & Stocks to Buy on Likely September Rate Cut  ).   Bottom Line    While this strategy is highly beneficial for short-term traders, it could lead to huge losses compared to traditional funds in fluctuating or seesawing markets.

In this article, Trefis analyzes key trends in  Estee Lauder's earnings   and highlights the reasons behind the surge in its stock price. Also, we detail why we think Estee Lauder' stock looks expensive after the sharp rally. You can also find more of our Consumer Discretionary sector data here. 

 A Quick Look at   Estee Lauder's Revenues  

Estee Lauder reported $14.8 billion in Net Sales for the fiscal year 2019 ( Estee Lauder's fiscal year ends in June  ). This includes four revenue streams:

 The Rally Was Triggered By Strong Guidance For Fiscal   2020 

 Diversified Sales Channels & Growing Emerging Markets   Support Guidance, But We Remain Wary of China Headwinds 

Considering Estee Lauder's revenues ( shows key revenue components  ) of $16 billion for 2020, we estimate a non-GAAP EPS of $5.87. This EPS figure coupled with a forward P/E multiple of 32.5, works out to a price estimate of $192 for Estee lauder's stock ( shows cash and valuation analysis  ), which is roughly 5% below the current market price.

2019-09-03 12:01:00,"JERUSALEM, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Israel accused Hezbollah on Tuesday of setting up a factory for precision-guided missiles in Lebanon's Bekaa valley, in a veiled warning of further possible Israeli counter-strikes after a drone attack near Beirut set off brief cross-border fighting.

Sunday's shelling exchange was the fiercest between Israel and Hezbollah since the 2006 Lebanon war. While neither is keen to escalate, Israel has said it could act against any upgrades of Hezbollah's missile arsenal, while Hezbollah has said it would retaliate for attacks on Lebanese soil. 

In a statement to media accompanied by satellite images, the Israeli military said that Hezbollah, with Iranian assistance, had been bringing specialised equipment to a weapons factory near the Bekaa village of al-Nabi Sheet with a view to setting up a production line for precision-guidance missiles.

There was no immediate comment from Hezbollah, which has denied having precision-guided missile production sites in Lebanon. But it says it possess such weapons, which could be used to home in on and knock out key Israeli infrastructure.

In an Aug 31 speech, Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah accused Israel of using the movement's capability with precision-guided missiles as a pretext for attacks.

Israel has not formally claimed responsibility for the Beirut drone strike, which a regional security source said hit a component of the precision-guided missile project.

2019-09-03 07:38:51,"Arbor Realty Trust Inc (Symbol: ABR) has been named as a Top 10 Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), according to Dividend Channel  , which published its most recent ''DividendRank''  report. The report noted that among REITs, ABR shares displayed both attractive valuation metrics and strong profitability metrics. For example, the recent ABR share price of $12.55 represents a price-to-book ratio of 1.3 and an annual dividend yield of 9.24% - by comparison, the average stock in Dividend Channel's coverage universe yields 3.9% and trades at a price-to-book ratio of 2.2. The report also cited the strong quarterly dividend history at Arbor Realty Trust Inc, and favorable long-term multi-year growth rates in key fundamental data points.      The report stated, '' Dividend investors approaching investing from a value standpoint are generally most interested in researching the strongest most profitable companies, that also happen to be trading at an attractive valuation. That's what we aim to find using our proprietary DividendRank formula, which ranks the coverage universe based upon our various criteria for both profitability and valuation, to generate a list of the top most 'interesting' stocks, meant for investors as a source of ideas that merit further research.  ''  makeArticleAd();  REITs hold a special place in the hearts of dividend investors, because they must distribute at least 90% of their taxable income each year to shareholders as dividends. While this can make for a high dividend yield, it also introduces some volatility and uncertainty into the level of payments from year to year - hu ge dividend payout  s are common when a REIT turns large profits, versus smaller payouts or even periods of no dividends in times of losses.    The current annualized dividend paid by Arbor Realty Trust Inc is $1.16/share, currently paid in quarterly installments, and its most recent dividend ex-date was on 08/14/2019. Below is a long-term dividend history chart for ABR, which the report stressed as being of key importance. Indeed, studying a company's past  dividend history  can be of good help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.      10 Top Ranked High Yield REITs »

2019-09-03 12:00:00,"Shopping has changed considerably since the late 1990s, when online marketplaces first started luring shoppers away from brick-and-mortar stores. Mobile apps succeeded traditional websites, and retailers that didn't roll with the punches were left behind.

The online shopping market is still evolving, and many retailers are already experimenting with next-generation technology platforms like smart speakers, subscription services, and even augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) shopping apps.

AR/VR shopping sounds futuristic, but a recent GfK survey found that 68% of respondents recognized the technology and 5% regularly shop through AR/VR apps. However, that adoption rate remains lower than smart speakers or subscription services.

Data source: GfK. Chart by author.

Several retailers offer AR and VR apps for smartphones. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and IKEA have apps that allow users to project furniture and home decor into rooms, LVMH 's Sephora lets users test digital makeup, and Gap 's customers can try on clothes in a virtual dressing room.

Amazon and Walmart  are even developing VR shopping experiences, but it's unclear when those apps will arrive. This market remains a niche one, but better smartphone cameras, cheaper VR headsets, and lighter AR glasses could all drive its long-term growth.

2019-09-03 08:50:00,"  Ford Motor Company F  has recalled more than 550,000 trucks and SUVs in North America to resolve an issue with the vehicles' seat backs. Per the company, the third pawl required for seat-back strength may be missing from these vehicles. In case of a crash, this poorly-assembled recliner mechanism might be unable to restrain the passenger adequately, thus escalating the risk of injury.  makeArticleAd();  Nevertheless, Ford has stated that it is unaware of any crashes or injuries. The company's latest action will affect 483,325 vehicles in the United States and the federal territories, 58,712 in Canada, and 8,149 vehicles in Mexico.    The affected vehicles include Ford F-150 from the company's 2018-2020 models, Ford F-Series Super Duty trucks and Expedition vehicles from the 2019 and 2020 models, and Explorer SUVs from 2018 through 2019. The safety recall also includes some 2020 Ford Explorer and Lincoln Aviator vehicles with rear seats, along with manual seat-back recliner mechanisms. These vehicles feature manual driver or front-passenger seat-back recliner mechanisms.    The Ford F-150 vehicles were manufactured in the Dearborn Assembly Plant from Sep 14, 2018 through Aug 7, 2019, and the Kansas City Assembly facility from Sep 11, 2018 through Aug 2, 2019. The Ford F-Series Super Duty vehicles were built at the Kentucky Assembly Plant from Sep 9, 2018 through Jul 22, 2019, as well as the Ohio Assembly Plant from Sept 11, 2018 through Jul 17, 2019. Further, Explorer SUVs were built from Sep 9, 2018, through Mar 3, 2019 in the Chicago Assembly facility, while Expedition vehicles were manufactured from Oct 16, 2018 through Jul 24, 2019 in the Kentucky Assembly Plant.

Dealers will examine the seat structure of the affected vehicles, with most of these expected to clear the inspection without any requirement for repair. In case of any need for repair, the dealer will replace the seat structure without any service charges from customers.    Like some of its peers, Ford too has been recalling vehicles due to safety issues. Frequent recalls for fixing faulty vehicles are concerns for the company. Apart from higher expenses for repairing faulty vehicles, recalls also hurt consumers' confidence in a brand. In fact, in August, Ford announced the recall of more than 108,000 mid-size cars in North America in a bid to resolve an issue with seat belt anchor pretensioners. The vehicles' front seat belt cable could reduce the strength below the required level due to heat buildup, which may not sufficiently restrain passengers.    Further, this July, Ford withdrew nearly 58,000 Focus cars in North America which had an issue with the powertrain control module software that could deform the vehicles' fuel tanks. Also, earlier in June, the company recalled 1.2 million Explorer SUVs, citing a potential suspension link-fracture issue. In May, it recalled roughly 273,000 of Ford Ranger pickups and Fusion vehicles in North America. In April, the company recalled nearly 874,000 trucks for engine block heater cable defects.

2019-09-03 11:51:00,"Shares of Conn's (NASDAQ: CONN) rose on Tuesday after the retailer reported second-quarter results that beat expectations. Sales growth from furniture, mattresses, and appliances offset weakness elsewhere, driving total revenue higher. The stock was up about 15% at 10:45 a.m. EDT.

Conn's reported second-quarter revenue of $401.1 million, up 4.3% year over year and nearly $3 million higher than the average analyst estimate. Retail sales rose 3.3% to $306.1 million, driven entirely by new stores. Same-store sales declined by 2.3%, with stores in areas hit by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 seeing a steeper 9.3% decline. The company believes rebuilding efforts in these markets during the second quarter of 2018 made for a difficult comparison this year.

Furniture and mattress sales grew 2.5% to $99.5 million, while home appliance sales rose 8.6% to $99.4 million. Sales of both consumer electronics and home office products were down, with both suffering double-digit declines on a same-store basis. Credit revenue was up 7.5% year over year to $94.8 million.

Earnings per share came in at $0.62, up from $0.53 in the prior-year period and $0.11 better than analysts were expecting. Higher sales and a slight reduction in bad debt provision pushed up the bottom line.

""During the second half of this fiscal year, we expect to lap the benefits Hurricane Harvey rebuilding efforts had on same store sales, which has impacted the year-over-year sales comparison over the past four quarters,"" said Conn's CEO Norm Miller in prepared remarks included in the earnings release.

For the third quarter, Conn's expects a change in same-store sales of between negative 3% and positive 1%, and retail sales growth of between 4% and 8%.

Sept 3 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday as data showed factory activity shrank for the first time since 2016 in August, renewing fears that a drawn-out trade war between the United States and China could tip the world's largest economy into recession.

The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity dropped to 49.1, compared with a reading of 51.1 estimated by analysts polled by Reuters.  

""Sentiment was already poor to start the day and then the weaker-than-expected manufacturing data just added fuel to the fire,"" said Dave Mazza, managing director and head of product at asset management firm Direxion in New York.

""We now have confirmation that the escalation in the trade war has spilled over to U.S. manufacturing just as it has to manufacturing around the globe,"" he added.

U.S. stocks started the day on weak footing as Washington and Beijing kicked off a new round of tariffs over the weekend, worrying investors who see no signs of an early resolution to the long-running trade war, which has rattled markets for months and weighed on world economies.

Rising OPEC and Russian production, combined with demand concerns due to a global economic slowdown dragged down oil prices and drove a 1.3% drop in energy shares .

Trade-sensitive industrials  slipped 1.8%, while technology stocks  fell 1.2%.

Chipmakers, which have large revenue exposure to China, also fell. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index  dropped 2%.

At 12:56 p.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was down 355.99 points, or 1.35%, at 26,047.29, the S&P 500  was down 24.48 points, or 0.84%, at 2,901.98 and the Nasdaq Composite  was down 85.73 points, or 1.08%, at 7,877.15.

Boeing Co shares , tumbled 3.2%, weighing the most on the Dow, after the Federal Aviation Administration said on Friday a global panel of experts will need a few more weeks to finish its review into the company's 737 MAX certification. 

U.S. casino operators felt the brunt of slowing economic growth in China as gambling hub Macau posted weak August casino revenue. Shares of Wynn Resorts Ltd , Las Vegas Sands Corp  and MGM Resorts International  fell between 2% and 4.5%. 

Investors will also keep a close watch on the monthly jobs report due on Friday, which is expected to offer clues on the likelihood of another rate cut from the Federal Reserve at its mid-September meeting.

The disappointing manufacturing data is not out of sync with the market's expectation of a 25 basis point rate cut this month but weaker-than-expected non-manufacturing data may change the central bank's perspective on cutting rates further, Mazza said.

Among few gainers were the defensive utilities , real estate  and consumer staples  sectors.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.94-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 2.57-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P index recorded 36 new 52-week highs and nine new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 42 new highs and 113 new lows.","Wall Street bogged down by weak manufacturing data, trade worries - Nasdaq.com",https://www.nasdaq.com/article/wall-street-bogged-down-by-weak-manufacturing-data-trade-worries-20190903-00966

Anyone who has been following the DOL/SEC-fiduciary     rule/best interest saga is probably sick of the word     ""harmonization"". The term is a catch-all for the idea that the     two agencies will synchronize their rule-making so there won't     be any grey area or uncertainty for advisors. We doubt that     will happen (or even can, given the law of unintended     consequences). Yet, a top industry law firm has just weighed on     the specific points where harmonization may happen. The first     big area to consider is rollovers, as both agencies have in the     past claimed it as their own territory. That will likely be an     area where harmonization is necessary because of previous     guidance issued by both. Electronic disclosures will be another     priority area. Additionally, the rules governing defined     benefit versus defined contribution plans will also need to be     harmonized.

 FINSUM      :     We are slightly doubtful their will be some great     harmonization between the DOL and the SEC. So, expect some     uncertainty, grey areas, and more business for lawyers.

Sept 3 (Reuters) - Oilfield services provider Patterson-UTI  on Tuesday said it had no plans to invest in electric hydraulic fracturing fleets, pointing to the high cost of building equipment and the oversupplied pressure pumping market.

The company provides drilling and hydraulic fracturing services for oil and gas producers. It has explored divesting its fracking business as customers are cutting back on new projects. 

Patterson-UTI manufactures electrical control systems used for electric frac spreads, but does not own any electric frac fleets.

""I'll tell you today, the math doesn't work,"" said Chief Executive Officer Andy Hendricks at the Barclays Energy-Power Conference in New York, pointing to the oversupplied pressure pumping market.

""We don't see the need to go that route today, but we could do it if we want,"" he added.

The company already runs some drilling rigs on natural gas produced at nearby wells, and on Tuesday said in the past year it started running some drilling rigs on lithium battery packs, in addition to diesel.

FRANKFURT, Sept 3 (Reuters) - ECB policymakers are leaning towards a stimulus package that includes a rate cut, a beefed-up pledge to keep rates low for longer and compensation for banks over the side-effects of negative rates, five sources familiar with the discussion said.

Many also favour restarting asset buys, a significantly more powerful weapon, but opposition from some northern European countries is complicating this issue, the sources, who declined to be named, added.

With economic growth slowing as a global trade war threatens to escalate, the ECB has all but promised to announce more stimulus after its Sept 12 meeting, leaving markets only to guess about the composition of the expected package.

The sources added that there was no reason to stagger stimulus moves over several meetings, even if Brexit uncertainty was still likely to rise. But they said it was also vital for the ECB to leave some tools unused for Christine Lagarde - due to take over as president from Mario Draghi on Nov 1 - to deploy, if needed.

Several sources said final proposals were likely to be given to policymakers only during the week of their meeting, as is now customary before major decisions.

Bond purchases are especially controversial because the ECB is nearing self-imposed issuer limits, so any substantial programme risked forcing policymakers to ditch their own rules and open the scheme to legal challenges.

But three of the sources said the ECB had room for about one year of bond buys using the flexibility of its existing framework, so these was no immediate need to change the rule requiring the ECB to hold no more than one-third of each country's bonds.

Sovereign debt would remain the cornerstone of any new purchase programme, but private sector assets were also again likely to be included, the sources added.

The ECB ended its 2.6 trillion euro ($2.90 trillion) bond buying scheme, known as quantitative easing, just last December and looked set to raise interest rates this year as the economy picked up.

But sentiment has deteriorated rapidly since as the trade war cut into exports, Brexit sapped confidence and a slowdown in China weakened demand.

Germany's economy shrank last quarter and the bloc's industrial sector is also contracting, raising the risk that export troubles could soon infect the domestic economy.

With banks already suffering under the slowdown, any rate cut is expected to be accompanied by a multi-tier deposit rate, which exempts banks from some of the ECB's punitive charges for holding overnight deposits.

The ECB's deposit rate currently stands at minus 0.4% and, to prop up confidence, the ECB is likely to revise its pledge to keep rates low, unveiling 'reinforced' guidance that will specify what inflation conditions will be needed before they can rise.

The ECB currently aims to keep rates at present or lower levels at least through the first half of 2020 and the new guidance is likely to cut the emphasis on specific timeframes for change, the sources added.

2019-09-03 10:56:00,"After upbeat results from a Phase 3 trial, shares of Ardelyx (NASDAQ: ARDX) , a clinical-stage biotech focused on cardiorenal disease, rose as much as 23% in early-morning trading on Tuesday. Shares were up about 16% as of 10:37 a.m. EDT.

Ardelyx reported positive results from its Phase 3 AMPLIFY study today. This trial was designed to test its experimental drug tenapanor in combination with phosphate binders as a hopeful treatment for patients with chronic kidney disease who are on dialysis.

Here are the key takeaways from the study:

Image source: Getty Images.

Ardelyx's CEO Mike Raab was happy with the results:

We are thrilled with the positive results from the AMPLIFY study demonstrating that tenapanor can help significantly more patients achieve the established serum phosphorus treatment goal of less than 5.5 mg/dL. This result is striking as serum phosphorus levels above 5.5 mg/dL are associated with increased mortality. For too long, hyperphosphatemia management has been an enormous challenge for patients and clinicians. With tenapanor, patients may finally be able to achieve their treatment goal.

Traders are bidding up the stock in response to the encouraging clinical results.

Ardelyx is currently running another Phase 3 study called PHREEDOM that is testing tenapanor as a monotherapy. The company expects to share results from that trial in the fourth quarter. Once the PHREEDOM trial is complete, management plans to submit tenapanor for regulatory approval in monotherapy and combination therapy for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia.

Investing in biotech stocks can be risky, especially when the company is still in the clinical stage. However, Ardelyx could be on the cusp of becoming a commercial business, because tenapanor is currently pending FDA approval as a potential treatment for irritable bowel syndrome with constipation . A go/no go decision is expected to be handed down by Sept. 12, 2019, so investors won't have to wait long to learn more.

The back half of 2019 should be an exciting time for Ardelyx's investors. This Fool plans on following this company's progress with great interest.

Sept 3 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were set to open lower on Tuesday, as Washington's new round of tariffs on some Chinese goods kicked in and after a report that officials from both sides were struggling to decide on the schedule for a meeting this month.

Shares of trade-sensitive industrial bellwethers Caterpillar Inc  and Boeing Co  fell about 2% each in premarket trading, while those of Apple Inc  fell 1%.

A monthly survey on manufacturing activity by the Institute for Supply Management, due at 10 a.m. ET, is expected to shed some light on the impact of the trade war on the U.S. industrial sector.

The ISM manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) is expected to dip to 51.1 in August, from 51.2 in the month before.

Although U.S. factory activity has been slowing in recent months, the ISM's index has so far stayed above 50, indicating expansion in the sector.

""We're getting very close to a contraction and obviously if we get any number in today's report that does take us even closer then that would be one more nail in the coffin in terms of economic weakness,"" Cardillo said.

The S&P 500 index  fell 1.8% in August, its biggest monthly drop since May, after escalating trade tensions and the inversion of a key part of the U.S. yield curve, seen as a sign of recession, drove investors toward safe-haven assets.

The benchmark index, however, ended the week up nearly 3% as trade tensions were dialed down following signals that Beijing and Washington would meet in September for talks.

Bloomberg, however, reported on Monday that the two sides were yet to agree on a date for the planned meeting.

The Trump administration on Sunday began collecting 15% tariff on more than $125 billion in Chinese imports, while China began imposing new duties on U.S. crude. 

Chipmakers, which draw a large portion of their revenue from China, also fell, with Intel Corp , Advanced Micro Devices  and Micron Technology Inc  off between 0.7% and 1.6%.

At 8:47 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis  were down 171 points, or 0.65%. S&P 500 e-minis  were down 14.5 points, or 0.5% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis  were down 36.25 points, or 0.47%.

Along with the manufacturing data, investors will also keep a close watch on the monthly jobs report due on Friday for clues on the health of the U.S. economy.

U.S. casino operators felt the brunt of slowing economic growth in China as gambling hub Macau posted an 8.6% decline in August casino revenue, sending shares of Wynn Resorts Ltd , Las Vegas Sands Corp  and MGM Resorts International  down between 1.6% and 2%. 

Shares of Ulta Beauty  fell 1.6%, extending a slide from Friday, after Citigroup cut the rating on the cosmetics retailer's stock to ""neutral"".

In this   video, we're going to take a look at Disney's new video streaming   service, called Disney+, and how it stacks up against the   established competitors. Ever since Walt Disney's announcement of Disney+, fans and   investors alike have been eagerly awaiting the latest entrant   into the streaming wars. Disney+ is scheduled to launch on Nov. 12, and the company   expects to have more than 100 recent films and over 400 older   movies available within the first year. It's also developing 25 new series and movies that will be   exclusive to the platform. The Disney+ programming will come from across the company's   Marvel, Pixar, Lucasfilm, and Disney brands, as well as   contributions from Fox and National Geographic. While creating an entirely new video streaming service is   certainly a big move for Disney, how exactly does Disney+ stack   up to its rivals? One of the most important differentiating factors between   Disney+ and its competitors is its price. Disney+ costs just   $6.99 per month in the U.S., and if you pay annually, it's only a   $69.99 per year. The price includes four simultaneous streams, 4K video, ultra   high definition (UHD), and high dynamic range (HDR) picture   quality when available, all at no extra cost. And users also get   unlimited video downloads. To put this into context, Netflix's premium plan, which offers   some similar features, costs $15.99 a month, far more than   Disney+. And Disney+ is cheaper than Amazon Prime Video -- the   second-largest streaming service in the U.S. -- which costs $8.99   per month. In addition to its low cost, Disney will also offer a bundle   of Disney+, ESPN+, and the ad-supported version of Hulu for just   $12.99 in the U.S. Which will give viewers access to sports   programming, the library of content from Disney, as well as   original programming and broadcast shows from Hulu. But just because Disney will have the best video streaming   deal doesn't mean it'll easily topple Netflix and Amazon's   dominance. Netflix has 60 million paying subscribers in the U.S. and 91   million international subscribers. Meanwhile, Amazon's has more   than 100 million Prime members in the U.S. that have access to   the company's video streaming service. Subscribers aside, both Amazon and Netflix have spent years --   and billions of dollars -- creating their own original video   content. For Netflix, spending huge sums of money to produce and   license content -- including $15 billion in 2019 -- is a matter   of survival. Netflix's entire business is built on video streaming, and it   has to be the best at what it does in order to grow its top and   bottom lines. For Amazon, video streaming is more of a side business that   provides value to its Prime members and keeps its customers   engaged with the company. While Disney has its theme parks, and its vast movie and TV   empire, the company is betting that Disney+ will play an   important role in controlling its own content, as well as forging   direct relationships with its customers. Disney's CEO Bob Iger recently said that ""Disney+ marks a bold   step forward in an exciting new era for our company...."" The bottom line is that Disney+ will likely be one of the most   competitive video streaming services on the market. And even   Netflix and Amazon will have a hard time matching Disney's   stockpile of beloved characters and stories. No other company has been as successful at turning   storytelling into such a lucrative business as Disney -- which is   why Disney+ competitors should be worried.

2019-09-03 09:26:46,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

As the U.S.-China trade war has ebbed and flowed over the past year, so has Alibaba  (NYSE: BABA ) stock. BABA  stock has bounced wildly over the past 12 months. Ultimately, though, Alibaba stock has not made any progress.

The price of Alibaba stock in late August 2018 was $175. The closing price on Friday was $175.

In other words, as the trade war has hung over Alibaba stock, the shares have gone nowhere. Alibaba stock has  been volatile, but it's been flat. The big question now is: how long will it continue on that path?

The answer is, not much longer. In fact, I believe there are ten reasons why investors should  be bullish on Alibaba stock over the next few months and over the next few years. Those ten reasons can be divided into two segments:  the five most important reasons to buy BABA stock and the five less important reasons to buy BABA stock.

Without further ado, let's jump into looking at those ten reasons.

In no particular order, here are the five most important reasons to buy Alibaba stock.

1. The Overall Outlook of Alibaba Group Remains Favorable. Throughout China and Southeast Asia, internet penetration, per capita income and consumer spending remain well below the averages of  developed nations. But the,internet penetration, per capita income and consumer spending  of China and Southeast Asia  are grinding higher. They will move still higher over the next several years as the Chinese government continues to support the expansion of its technology industry. That means that Southeast Asia's digital economy will also continue to expand at a rapid rate for the foreseeable future. Alibaba Group finds itself at the epicenter of that digital economy, so its days of strong growth are just beginning.

2. China's Consumer Economy Is Turning Around. Multiple data points suggest that China's consumer economy, which slowed meaningfully in 2018 and early 2019, is accelerating  in mid-2019. These data points include the improvement of a composite leading indicator and of a consumer confidence index, an acceleration of retail-sales growth, and the stabilization of the nation's manufacturing activity and trade data.

3. Trade Tensions Should Ease Going Forward. This trade war follows a rather predictable cycle. Trade tensions escalate, causing markets to sell  off. Then, the two countries come back to the negotiation table, easing tensions and causing markets to rally. We are currently in the ""coming back to the table"" part of the cycle. So tensions should ease over the next few weeks to months. Markets should rally, pushing Alibaba stock higher.

4. Alibaba's Margins Are Improving. A big knock against Alibaba stock over the past few years has been its lack of profit growth. This situation has persisted because its margins have dropped as the company has spent an arm and a leg to fuel its strong growth. Now Alibaba Group is reducing some of that spending. As a  result, its margins are moving higher. In Q2, for the first time in two years, Alibaba's profit margins over the previous 12 months  actually were higher than in the 12 months preceding the previous quarter.

5. The valuation of Alibaba Stock Is Attractive. Last quarter, Alibaba's revenue growth came in at over 40%, and its profit growth, excluding some items, was over 50%. BABA stock trades at just 25 times Alibaba's expected 2019 earnings. That's a pretty reasonable multiple, considering the company's  profit growth. As a result, Alibaba stock can rise meaningfully.

Here are five less important reasons to be bullish on Alibaba stock in both the near-term and the long-term.

1. Alibaba Is Adding New Revenue Streams. Alibaba Group is so much more than an e-commerce company. It's a cloud company, a media company, and more recently, it's become a data-as-a-service company. By diversifying its revenue streams, Alibaba has increased its exposure to the continuous-growth Southeast Asia digital economy. The higher BABA's exposure to that sector becomes, the higher its growth can be in the long-term.

2. Alibaba Is Going Global. Up until now, Alibaba's marketplace has been open to U.S. buyers, but closed to U.S. sellers. That just recently changed. Alibaba is now letting Americans sell products on its platform . Many American sellers are anxious to sell products to China's huge consumer class. Consequently, over the next several quarters, a flurry of U.S. merchants will flock to Alibaba Group, and this rush of new sellers will meaningfully increase its revenues over the next few quarters.

3. The Technicals of Alibaba Stock Look Good. Despite the trade war, BABA stock has formed a solid uptrend in 2019, based on consistently higher lows. This uptrend appears alive and well, despite the escalation of the trade war in August. Consequently, from a technical standpoint, Alibaba stock looks poised to grind higher into the end of the year.

4. Wall Street Is Bullish on BABA Stock. Wall Street analysts aren't always right. But they are a smart group of stock pickers worth listening to. According to YCharts , the average Wall Street recommendation on Alibaba Group is a  ""Strong Buy."" The average  price target on Alibaba stock is $215, over 20% above Friday's closing price.

5. Interest Rates Are Low. Interest rates around the world are at all-time lows. Although that means investors are pessimistic about long-term growth prospects, ironically, low rates are good for growth stocks. Growth stocks - like Alibaba stock - are more attractive in a low-interest world in which safe investments produce very little return.  Consequently, growth stocks like BABA stock should continue to be attractive.

Over the long-term, Alibaba stock will be a winner. In the near-term, once trade-war tensions permanently ease, BABA stock will fly higher.

Thus, when it comes to BABA stock, patience is key. Don't stress the trade war. Stay the course and wait for headlines  about the trade war to pass.

As of this writing, Luke Lango was long BABA.

JOHANNESBURG, Sept 3 (Reuters) - South African police arrested more than 80 people and confirmed five deaths as riots in Johannesburg and the capital Pretoria intensified on Tuesday, spreading to surrounding townships with roving groups attacking mainly foreign-owned shops.

The streets of Alexandra township, at walking distance from the skyscrapers of Johannesburg's financial centre Sandton, were littered on Tuesday afternoon with broken bricks and glass from buildings torched in overnight fires and debris from police battles with local groups.

""Even now we are scared to come this side,"" he said. His store sells items like bread, milk and phone cards in the working class neighbourhood, which is regularly rattled by unrest and protests over poor living conditions and jobs.

The latest wave of unrest in South Africa has raised fears of a recurrence of violence aimed at foreigners in 2015 in which at least seven people were killed. Before that, some 60 people were killed in a wave of unrest around the country in 2008.

Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari said on Tuesday he was  urgently sending a special envoy to meet with President Cyril Ramaphosa to secure the ""safety of (Nigerian citizens') lives and property"".

Police have yet to pinpoint what triggered the violence, which began on Sunday when protesters armed with makeshift weapons roamed the streets of Pretoria's business district pelting shops with rocks and petrol bombs and running off with goods.

High unemployment and widespread poverty have been cited as possible triggers for the recent disturbances and attacks on immigrants, but some officials say the riots may be the work of criminal syndicates.

""We can't rule out pure criminality, of criminals using a sensitive situation where there are real grievances on issues of unemployment and foreign nationals,"" police minister Bheki Cele told reporters.

Cele confirmed five people had been killed in the three days of rioting, but did not give further details on the circumstances, or on arrests.

He ruled out sending in the army, as the government did in Cape Town in July to quell a spate of gang-related killings.

The premier of Gauteng province, David Makhura, said during an inspection of the damage in Alexandra that there was a ""xenophobic sentiment"" underlying the attacks. He said 86 people around the province, which includes the city of Johannesburg, had been arrested, seven of them in Alexandra.

Ramaphosa condemned the violence, saying in a video posted on Twitter that ""attacking businesses run by foreign nationals is totally unacceptable"".

Immigration to South Africa from across the continent and from parts of southeast Asia picked up in the early 1990s, spurred by the end of apartheid rule and the economic boom that followed.

But in recent years immigration has become a sensitive issue, with anti-immigrant attacks, economic hardship and a government clampdown on immigrants and asylum seekers.",South African police make more arrests as riots spread - Nasdaq.com,https://www.nasdaq.com/article/south-african-police-make-more-arrests-as-riots-spread-20190903-00917

The deal represents Vertex's foray into a new treatment space, as the company typically develops treatments for cystic fibrosis, an inherited disorder that causes damage to the lung and digestive system.

2019-09-03 13:00:00,"The advent of free-to-play titles like PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds(PUBG) and Fortnite: Battle Royale led to uncertain times for the video game industry, with veteran players and newcomers alike flocking to games in the new battle royale genre. No company has felt that migration more keenly than Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ATVI) . After hitting all-time highs just over a year ago, its stock went on to lose more than half its value (though it's currently down by about 39%) a slide that pushed the company into value stock territory .

Last week, Activision released World of Warcraft: Classic , a reboot of a fan-favorite version of the online fantasy role-playing game to commemorate the title's 15th anniversary. Its reception among gamers has been nothing short of phenomenal, and that enthusiastic response has given investors a much-needed boost of confidence that the worst may be over for the video game publisher.

Image source: Activision Blizzard.

The relaunch of the popular 2006 version of the game, Drums of War , was released to subscribers on Aug. 26, and nostalgic gamers flocked to the site, overwhelming servers, resulting in hours-long waits to log in.

World of Warcraft: Classic set a launch day record for the number of concurrent viewers on Twitch, the Amazon.com  platform where video game aficionados watch other gamers play via live-stream. On that first day, more than 6.1 million unique viewers tuned in, with as many as 1.1 million watching the proceedings at the same time.

These are clear indications that the game is going far better than Activision Blizzard had hoped for, which bodes well for the company's future.

One of Activision's more telling metrics recently has been monthly active users (MAUs), which have generally trended downward over the past couple of years. After peaking to close out 2017, MAUs in the company's Blizzard and Activision segments combined have fallen by more than 27%, though they managed a slight rebound toward the end of last year.

The falling user base has resulted in lackluster revenues. In the company's most recent quarter , total monthly active users fell to 327 million -- their lowest level in more than three years -- and revenue slid 15% year over year.

Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson chimed in on the impact of the successful game release. ""So far, it appears interest is really strong,"" he wrote. "" World of Warcraft Classic is another piece of incremental revenue to layer into late 2019 and into 2020 that could result in accelerating revenue growth for Activision Blizzard.""

Because the game is subscriber-based, attracting new players significantly impacts its incremental revenue and profitability. If the company adds several million World of Warcraft players due to interest generated by the Classic release, it would boost Activision's bottom line results significantly.

Earlier this year, Activision Blizzard embarked on a massive restructuring aimed at reinvigorating player engagement in the company's key titles. It revealed plans to expand the number of developers on its most important franchises by 20%, which will result in more up-front releases, in-game content, and mobile and geographic expansion.

World of Warcraft is one of those key titles, and Activision has additional plans for the game's anniversary celebration, including limited-time bonuses, commemorative in-game achievement opportunities, and more. The company says further announcements about those will be made in the coming weeks.

Activision previously warned investors that one byproduct of the restructuring would be that new content would be released on a slower schedule in 2019 than it was in previous years, which would weigh on the company's financial results for a time.

That said, investors might be willing to give the game publisher some additional leeway if it becomes clear that the company's focus on its key titles is beginning to bear fruit. If the reception of World of Warcraft: Classic is any indication of what's to come, Activision is off to a good start, and may be on the road to recovery.

Sept 3 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were set to open lower onTuesday, as Washington's new round of tariffs on some Chinesegoods kicked in and after a report that officials from bothsides were struggling to decide on the schedule for a meetingthis month.

Shares of trade-sensitive industrial bellwethers CaterpillarInc CAT.N and Boeing CoBA.N fell about 2% each in premarkettrading, while those of Apple IncAAPL.O fell 1%.    The tariffs that went into effect on Sunday are makinginvestors increasingly cynical towards the trade war, which hasdominated economic headlines for over a year, Peter Cardillo,chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New Yorksaid.

A monthly survey on manufacturing activity by the Institutefor Supply Management, due at 10 a.m. ET, is expected to shedsome light on the impact of the trade war on the U.S. industrialsector.

The ISM manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) isexpected to dip to 51.1 in August, from 51.2 in the monthbefore. 

Although U.S. factory activity has been slowing in recentmonths, the ISM's index has so far stayed above 50, indicatingexpansion in the sector.

""We're getting very close to a contraction and obviously ifwe get any number in today's report that does take us evencloser then that would be one more nail in the coffin in termsof economic weakness,"" Cardillo said. 

The S&P 500 index .SPX fell 1.8% in August, its biggestmonthly drop since May, after escalating trade tensions and theinversion of a key part of the U.S. yield curve, seen as a signof recession, drove investors toward safe-haven assets.

The benchmark index, however, ended the week up nearly 3% astrade tensions were dialed down following signals that Beijingand Washington would meet in September for talks.

Bloomberg, however, reported on Monday that the two sideswere yet to agree on a date for the planned meeting.

The Trump administration on Sunday began collecting 15%tariff on more than $125 billion in Chinese imports, while Chinabegan imposing new duties on U.S. crude. urn:newsml:reuters.com:*:nL3N25S01P

VIENNA, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Austrian sensor specialist AMS  made a 4.3 billion euro($4.8 billion) counter-offer for larger German lighting group Osram  on Tuesday, raising the prospect of a bidding war with private equity duo Bain Capital and Carlyle .

AMS made its 38.50 euro($42.90) per share offer for Osram, which is 10% above the price offered by the buyout firms, after approval from German finance watchdog Bafin, adding that the acceptance period will run from Sept. 3 until Oct. 1.

A spokesman for Bain and Carlyle declined to comment on Tuesday following the bid by AMS.

AMS, which makes a large part of its revenues from sensors for the face recognition technology in the latest iPhones but wants to reduce its dependence on Apple , is interested in Osram's technologies for self-driving cars and wants to create a global power in sensors and photonics.

Osram shareholders who have already decided to tender for the private equity groups' offer of 35 euros per share can withdraw and retender, AMS said.

Both bidders have provided for a minimum acceptance threshold of 70%.

""Our offer and the combination of Osram and AMS represents a better option to all stakeholders than the private equity proposal,"" AMS Chief Executive Alexander Everke said.

The AMS bid includes a 4.2 billion euro bridging loan facility underwritten by UBS  and HSBC , which AMS plans to refinance by issuing debt and equity.

SHARES RISE 

Osram shares gained as much as 2.3% but did not rise above 37.20 euros. Shares in Swiss-listed AMS rose 1.9%, still 10 Swiss francs below the closing price before it detailed its takeover plans last month.

The transaction, if successful, would be the largest purchase in AMS's history. In the 1990s, the group had miscalculated with two acquisitions in Germany and South Africa and had to sell the businesses later at a loss.

Osram, whose lightbulbs were once ubiquitous in European homes, got into difficulties with a strategy to reinvent itself as a high-tech photonics company that included several acquisitions and a billion-euro investment in Asia.

Under Everke, who took the helm three years ago, AMS has focused on buying new technologies. Its largest acquisition so far was the purchase of Singapore-based sensor maker Heptagon in 2016 for $855 million.

Analysts said the combination of AMS's and Osram's lidar systems - sensors that use laser light pulses to render precise images of the environment around a car - would make sense.

However, it might take several years until these systems bring solid revenue flows, IHS Markit analyst Dexin Chen said.

Investors also questioned how the Austrian company, which has 8,500 employees, will be able to integrate the German group, which last year had more than 24,200 staff working in more than 120 countries and at 27 production facilities worldwide.

Factors Favoring Service Corporation    Service Corporation's growth efforts are mainly aimed at improving revenues, utilizing scale and deploying capital efficiently. Well, the company focuses on addressing the changing consumer needs and utilizing its robust scale to drive preneed sales. In fact, its second-quarter 2019 comparable cemetery revenues inched up 0.7% year over year, mainly driven by growth in recognized preneed sales.    Further, Service Corporation is making technological advancements to better present its products and services to consumers. These factors along with the demographic landscape are tailwinds for the company's revenues. Markedly, Service Corporation is likely to continue gaining from the aging Baby Boomer population, which is fueling its preneed cemetery sales programs and likely to drive preneed and at need funeral results. Going ahead, the company plans to allocate about $195 million toward capital enhancements at existing facilities and cemetery development.    This apart, Service Corporation is committed toward pursuing buyouts for both its segments and building new funeral homes to generate greater returns.

In the second quarter of 2019, interest costs rose $2.8 million to $47.3 million due to higher interest rates on its floating rate debt. This also drove interest costs by $3.8 million in the first quarter to $47.4 million. We believe that persistent high costs may weigh on the company's bottom line in the near term.

Sept 3 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures fell on Tuesday, as Washington's new round of tariffs on some Chinese goods kicked in and after a report that officials from both sides were struggling to decide on the schedule for a meeting this month.

Shares of trade-sensitive industrial bellwethers Caterpillar Inc  and Boeing Co  fell 1.5% each in premarket trading, while those of Apple Inc  fell 1%.

The S&P 500 index fell 1.8% in August, its biggest monthly drop since May, after escalating U.S.-China trade tensions and the inversion of a key part of the U.S. yield curve, seen as a recessionary signal, drove investors toward safe-haven assets.

The benchmark index, however, ended the week up nearly 3% as trade tensions were dialed down following signals that Beijing and Washington would meet in September for talks.

Bloomberg, however, reported on Monday that the two sides were yet to agree on a date for the planned meeting.

The Trump administration on Sunday began collecting 15% tariffs on more than $125 billion in Chinese imports, while China began imposing new duties on U.S. crude. 

Chipmakers, which draw a large portion of their revenue from China, also fell, with Intel Corp , Advanced Micro Devices  and Micron Technology Inc  off between 1.4% and 2%.

At 7:27 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis  were down 207 points, or 0.78%. S&P 500 e-minis  were down 21.25 points, or 0.73% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis  were down 63.25 points, or 0.82%.

Along with the manufacturing data, investors will also keep a close watch on the monthly jobs report due Friday for clues on the health of the U.S. economy.

Also on Friday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will speak at an event hosted by the Swiss Institute of International Studies, University of Zurich.",Futures slip as trade tensions weigh - Nasdaq.com,https://www.nasdaq.com/article/futures-slip-as-trade-tensions-weigh-20190903-00476
2019-09-03 08:11:00,"  Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. TMO  has been gaining investors' confidence on consistently positive results. Over the past year, the company's shares have outperformed its industry  . The stock has gained 28.3% compared with 13.7% growth of the industry. Also, the company has outperformed the S&P 500's 15.3% rise during this period.  makeArticleAd();  The renowned medical and laboratory equipment provider has a market cap of $110.56 billion. The company's five-year projected growth rate looks impressive at 12.5%. It is expected to scale new highs in the near term. The company has average positive earnings surprise of 2.1% for the trailing four quarters.    With solid prospects, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is worth the wait for now.   What Makes the Stock an Attractive Pick?   Product Launches:  The company has been progressing well in terms of new-generation product development. Within mass spectrometry, it introduced new instruments, workflows and software, highlighted by two new-generation Orbitrap systems - the Exploris 480 and Eclipse Tribrid. Also, a new workflow (HR Multi-Attribute Method) has been introduced to make progress in biotherapeutics.        In genetic analysis, Thermo Fisher recently launched the Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 6 and 7 Pro Real-Time PCR systems to automate qPCR workflows. The company is also in the process of expanding its bioproduction capabilities to meet customer demand for biologics.   Acquisitions and Partnerships to Add Value:  We are looking forward to Thermo Fisher's recently-formed alliance with GlaxoSmithKline in the second quarter, where Thermo Fisher stated that it will acquire a site in Cork, Ireland, from GlaxoSmithKline. This will add to the existing capacities of Thermo Fisher's Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (""API"") network.    This apart, the Brammer Bio deal also seems to work in the company's favor as this will likely expand opportunities in gene therapy and set a revised standard for viral vector manufacturing.   Strong End-Market Growth:  Thermo Fisher is experiencing strong growth in the pharma and biotech sector. Although in the last-reported quarter, growth in industrial and applied segments was in low single-digits, the company performed well due to strong demand for its chemical analysis, chromatography and mass spectrometry products. It also maintained its growth momentum in clinical diagnostics and immunodiagnostic businesses, and also witnessed strong demand in its health care market channel.   Raised Guidance Buoys Optimism    Thermo Fisher recently raised its 2019 adjusted earnings per share guidance to $12.16-$12.26 from $12.08-$12.22 mentioned earlier. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $12.24 remains within the company's projected range. This indicates that it will likely be able to maintain its ongoing bullish momentum for the rest of the year.   Downsides   Bottom Line Pressure on Business Divestment:  Thermo Fisher completed the divestiture of the Anatomical Pathology business to PHC Holdings Corporation for $1.14 billion in cash in the second quarter. This sector was one of the major contributors to the company's revenues. The subsequent closure of this sector is expected to put pressure on Thermo Fisher's financials.   Competitive Landscape:    On account of its diversified portfolio, Thermo Fisher faces competition from different types of companies - including a broad range of manufacturers and third-party distributors. The competitive landscape is quite tough with changing technology and customer demand, which require continuous research and development.   Which Way Are Estimates Heading?    The estimate revision trend for the current year is impressive. Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company's earnings has inched up 0.33% to $12.24.    The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 revenues is pegged at $25.42 billion, suggesting a 4.4% increase from the year-ago reported number.

Sept 3 (Reuters) - Walmart Inc , the nation's largest retailer, said on Tuesday it would stop selling ammunition for handguns and some assault-style rifles in all its stores across the United States, calling for national action on gun safety after a string of mass shootings, including two at Walmart stores in Texas and Mississippi.

Walmart is among U.S. companies, such as Delta Air Lines  and Bank of America , that increasingly are responding to the debate over guns and gun safety as mass shootings have proliferated, risking backlash from powerful national gun owners' groups while elected leaders consider options.

McMillon said the decision follows his visit to El Paso, Texas, on Aug. 6, three days after a gunman went on a rampage at a Walmart store there, killing 22 people.

Walmart is also urging that background checks be strengthened and that the reauthorization of a national assault weapons ban ""should be debated to determine its effectiveness,"" McMillon said in the letter, in which he described himself as a gun owner and said that company founder Sam Walton was ""an avid outdoorsman who had a passion for quail hunting.""

Walmart will stop selling handgun sales in Alaska, the only state where it still sells hand guns, and asked customers not to openly carry firearms in its stores, even in states that allow ""open carry"" of guns. The halt on the ammunition and handgun sales will come into effect when current inventory is sold out.

PRAISE AND CRITICISM

Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control advocacy group, applauded the actions, saying, ""Walmart has its finger on the pulse of what Americans want.""

The National Rifle Association (NRA), a pro-gun group with deep political ties, said Walmart was succumbing to pressure from ""anti-gun elites.""

""Lines at Walmart will soon be replaced by lines at other retailers who are more supportive of America's fundamental freedoms,"" it said.

The company said its latest actions would reduce its share of the ammunition market from around 20% to a range of about 6% to 9%, and would trend toward the lower end of that range over time.

U.S. gun and ammunition stores had total sales of about $11 billion last year, of which 19% was ammunition, according to market research firm IBISWorld.

The move reflects growing corporate activism on guns.

Walmart, like rival Dick's Sporting Goods , had already ended sales of assault rifles and raised the minimum age for gun purchases to 21.

Bank of America last year said it would no longer lend to companies making military-style firearms for civilians, and airlines Delta and United last year said they were no longer offering discounted rates to the NRA.

The latest move will leave Walmart focused on weapons for hunting, including deer rifles, shotguns and related ammunition.

""The general principle is if we don't sell the firearm we wouldn't sell the ammunition,"" a spokesman for Walmart told Reuters.

Walmart will stop selling all handgun ammunition and some short-barrel rifle ammunition such as the .223 caliber and 5.56 caliber after clearing current stock. Walmart did not comment on sales of other caliber ammunition.

While short-barrel ammunition is commonly used in some hunting rifles for small animals such as prairie dogs, it can also be used in military-style weapons with high-capacity magazines.

Just last month, Walmart said it would not change its policy on selling firearms even as it took down signs and playable demos of violent video games.

On Friday, McMillon in his letter to employees said he would send letters urging action on ""common sense measures"" to the White House and the Congressional leadership.","Walmart to stop selling ammunition for handguns, assault-style weapons - Nasdaq.com",https://www.nasdaq.com/article/walmart-to-stop-selling-ammunition-for-handguns-assaultstyle-weapons-20190903-00991

2019-09-03 07:30:00,"  OneMain Holdings, Inc. OMF  remains well poised for top-line growth, driven by robust consumer loan demand. Thus, it seems to be a wise idea to add the stock to your portfolio now.  makeArticleAd();  In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has been revised 6.9% and 4.7% upward for 2019 and 2020, respectively over the past 60 days. This reflects analysts' optimism regarding the company's earnings growth potential. Thus, the stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).    Further, the company's price performance looks impressive. The stock has rallied 47.6% so far this year, outperforming 26.8% growth recorded by the industry  .      What Makes Onemain Holdings an Attractive Investment Option   Revenue strength:  Onemain Holdings continues to record decent organic growth. The company's revenues have witnessed a five-year (2014-2018) CAGR of 11.7%, driven mainly by robust loan origination volume. Moreover, given the continued rise in demand for consumer loans and improving economy, the company's top line is expected to rise further.    Its projected sales growth rate of 4.8% for 2019 and 6.8% for 2020 indicates constant upward momentum in revenues.   Earnings growth:  Onemain Holdings witnessed earnings growth of 23.8% over the past three-five years, significantly above the industry average of 9.3%. This uptrend is likely to continue in the near term as reflected by its projected earnings growth rate of 20.2% and 5.6% for 2019 and 2020, respectively.    Notably, the company recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 7.7% over the trailing four quarters.

2019-09-03 14:07:00,"WASHINGTON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The Senate's antitrust panel will meet later this month to discuss concerns that tech giants, such as Google or Amazon, seek to buy smaller rivals in order to head off competition.

Senators Mike Lee and Amy Klobuchar, the chairman and top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel, said the hearing was scheduled for Sept. 24 but did not list witnesses.

""The Subcommittee also is interested in soliciting input from policy analysts, market participants, and other stakeholders on whether legislative action relating to such mergers is needed to ensure digital markets remain competitive,"" Lee said in a statement.

""Big technology companies have become some of the most powerful organizations in the world. They face little competition and there are numerous examples of the companies purchasing start-up competitors in various lines of business,"" she said.

The tech giants, among the most rich and powerful companies in the world, are facing increasingly intense antitrust scrutiny.

The Justice Department said in July that it was opening a broad investigation of major digital technology firms, focusing  on whether they engage in anticompetitive practices. The investigation is believed to be aimed at Alphabet Inc , Amazon.com Inc  and Facebook Inc , and potentially Apple Inc .

2019-09-03 10:56:00,"  Monster Beverage Corporation MNST  is experiencing momentum in the energy drinks category driven by the Monster Energy brand. In addition, the company has been consistently focusing on product launches and innovations besides strengthening its global footprint to increase market share.  makeArticleAd();  Despite these laudable efforts, shares of this  global market  er and distributor of energy drink beverages have lost 6.7% in the past three months. Meanwhile, the industry  rallied 2.8%. Notably, the company's lower-than-expected top and bottom lines in second-quarter 2019 resulted in the dismal price performance. While higher costs and soft margins weighed on earnings, unfavorable foreign currency affected sales in the reported quarter. Decline in sales at Strategic Brands and Other segments further dented the top line.      We note that input cost inflation and unfavorable product mix along with increased freight costs have been hurting the company's gross margin. In the second quarter, gross margin contracted 120 basis points (bps) mainly due to negative geographic and product sales mix as well as an increase in some input costs. This coupled with operating expenses dented operating margin, which was down 90 bps in second-quarter 2019.    These apart, Monster Beverage's significant international presence exposes it to foreign currency risks. In the second quarter, the company's top line was partly negated by unfavorable currency, which hurt gross and net sales by $25.9 million and $30.7 million, respectively. Further, net sales at the Monster Energy Drinks and Strategic Brands segments were adversely impacted by roughly $22.1 million and $3.8 million, respectively, from currency.   Initiatives to Offset Headwinds    While higher costs and adverse impact of currency are hurting Monster Beverage's performance, its strategic endeavors including TCCC Transaction appear promising.    Monster Beverage offers a wide range of energy drink brands like Monster Energy, Java Monster, Caffe Monster, Espresso Monster and more. The addition of Coca-Cola's KO  energy drink brands to the company's portfolio has further strengthened its position in the global energy drinks market.    Furthermore, the deal with Coca-Cola in 2015 (also referred to as the ""TCCC Transaction"") provides Monster Beverage with full access to Coca-Cola's world-class global distribution network. This deal has significantly boosted the company's international presence.    In March this year, the company completed the strategic alignment with Coca-Cola system bottlers in the United States, with the allotment of the Kalil Bottling Group's distribution territories (Southwestern United States). Additionally, it transitioned the distribution of Monster Energy drinks from Big Geyser's territory, located in the New York metro markets, to Liberty Coca-Cola in April.    In second-quarter 2019, Coke Bottlers launched the Monster Energy brand in Azerbaijan, Paraguay and Saudi Arabia. Going forward, Monster Beverage remains on track with the transitioning of the brand to Coca-Cola system bottlers in more countries.    In some markets of Europe, namely Greece, Bulgaria and Cyprus, the company launched the Predator energy brand. Monster Beverage also completed the rollout of Monster Ultra in China and launched Monster Mango. Management remains on track for more international launches later this year.

Sept 3 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday as data showed factory activity contracted for the first time since 2016 in August, renewing fears that a drawn-out trade war between the United States and China could tip the world's largest economy into recession.

The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity decreased to 49.1, compared with a reading of 51.1 estimated by analysts polled by Reuters. 

""A contraction in the manufacturing sector, which we haven't seen for a very long time, is important because it has a tendency to be a leading indicator for the rest of the economy including the services sector,"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin.

""The signals (for a recession) have been lining up and this  is one of them,"" Frederick said, adding that a downturn by late next year is ""very realistic.""

U.S. stocks opened lower as the lack of progress on negotiations between Washington and Beijing amid a new round of tariffs kicking in over the weekend weighed on sentiment.

The United States on Sunday began imposing 15% tariffs on a variety of Chinese goods, and China began imposing new duties on U.S. crude oil.

The energy sector  tumbled 1.7%, as rising OPEC and Russian crude output also drove a slump in oil prices. O/R

Trade-sensitive industrials  slipped 1.7%, while technology stocks  fell 1.2%.

Chipmakers, which draw a large portion of their revenue from China, also fell, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor index  down 1.9%.

The S&P 500 index fell 1.8% in August, its biggest monthly drop since May, after escalating trade tensions and the inversion of a key part of the U.S. yield curve, seen as a sign of recession, drove investors toward safe-haven assets.

However, trade tensions were dialed down last week following signals that Beijing and Washington would meet in September for talks, but Bloomberg reported on Monday that the two sides were struggling to agree on a date for the planned meeting.

At 11:23 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was down 361.35 points, or 1.37%, at 26,041.93 and the S&P 500  was down 24.80 points, or 0.85%, at 2,901.66.

The Nasdaq Composite  was down 78.11 points, or 0.98%, at 7,884.78.

Weighing the most on the Dow were shares of Boeing Co , which tumbled 3.4% after the Federal Aviation Administration said on Friday a global panel of experts will need a few more weeks to finish its review into the company's 737 MAX certification. 

U.S. casino operators felt the brunt of slowing economic growth in China as gambling hub Macau posted weak August casino revenue. Shares of Wynn Resorts Ltd , Las Vegas Sands Corp  and MGM Resorts International  fell between 2.4% and 4.5%. 

Among few gainers were the defensive utilities , real estate  and consumer staples  sectors.

2019-09-03 12:05:55,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Increasingly, oil giant Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM ) is looking like a tale of two cities. On one hand, Exxon Mobil stock enjoyed a brilliant surge between January and the last few days of April. This run up more than made up for the losses incurred last December. However, since the end of April, shares have not looked the same.

The volatility in the XOM stock price is understandable. Optimism toward a resolution of the U.S.-China trade war has given way to trepidation. With both sides trading barbs, seemingly unwilling to concede an inch due to pride and political pressures, there seems no end to the conflict. Moreover, because China owns the biggest automotive market in the world, economic deterioration there spells trouble for Exxon Mobil stock.

On another level, our own economy isn't firing on all cylinders. The yield curve inverted again . This historically has been a reliable indicator for predicting recessions. If we do succumb, consumers will shut down unnecessary spending, including limiting transportation use to vital functions. Such a deflationary environment would negatively impact XOM stock.

And if that weren't enough, Exxon Mobil stock faces another geopolitical headwind: the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC. Prior to recent events, OPEC members adopted a deal to collectively cut production in an effort to support oil prices. However, countries like Russia aren't exactly going along with the plan, stirring discord among other members.

In other words, we might see a flood of fresh supply. Based on simple economic principles, that would depress XOM stock. As such, is big oil too much of a big pain to bother with?

Underlining the many headwinds for Exxon Mobil stock is a technological shift. As a Bloomberg article highlighted a few days ago, XOM is about to lose its top-ten status as one of the S&P 500 's biggest companies. This would be the first such instance since the index began almost a century ago.

Additionally, the demotion represents the growing influence of technology and its replacement of industrial stalwarts. On the surface, that augurs unfavorably for Exxon Mobil stock as societies eye the end of hydrocarbon energy sources. However, that goal is far from becoming a reality.

While industry experts predict demand for automotive gasoline will peak due to improving fuel efficiencies and the rise of electric vehicles, I believe these forecasts are misguided.

For example, it's true that small sedans like the Toyota (NYSE: TM ) Corolla are popular worldwide. However, SUVs are gaining significant ground, and they may eventually overtake compact sedans. Combined with America's love for big vehicles, you have a recipe for robust oil demand. And that should translate to support for the XOM stock price.

Further, let's consider how modern cars achieve their improved fuel efficiency. One of the most popular ways is to fit smaller-displacement engines with turbochargers . Admittedly, turbocharging - under certain conditions - does improve fuel efficiency on front-facing statistics.

But on the back end, turbocharged vehicles are more complex than their naturally aspirated counterparts. They produce significantly more heat, and therefore require more upkeep , including frequent oil changes. Thus, fuel-efficient vehicles might hurt an oil company's gasoline revenues, but they can make up for it with alternative products.

But the other automotive headwind against Exxon Mobil stock that analysts often cite is the rise of EVs. Since their early days about ten years ago, EV sales have veritably skyrocketed. As more people make the switch, fossil-fueled cars appear on their last leg.

While EVs are popular, upgrading infrastructures for their mainstream integration is not. While charging stations are growing, monetizing them remains a huge challenge. Under a bull market, this effort is already an uphill battle. But in a recession? Forget about it.

Furthermore, under a downturn, I see the EV dramatically losing its financial incentive. For instance, I've discussed ad nauseum the surprising inefficiencies and inconveniences of EVs.

On another note, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) recently made a splash in business headlines regarding its Model 3 price cut . But that won't do anything about the other surprising cost of EV ownership: insurance premiums . Oh yeah, insuring the cheapest Tesla costs more than insuring a Porsche 911.

It's one of the reasons why drivers are turning in their Teslas for presumably ""normal,"" fossil-fueled vehicles.

Now, before you jump aboard XOM stock, I do think we will see volatility in oil prices. And that might spook investors, resulting in volatility in XOM. Because of the global economic context, shares are now more speculative than before.

At the same time, I'm not buying into the existential crisis argument for Exxon Mobil stock. This is still very much a relevant, longer-term investment. Therefore, if you're risk tolerant, I'd take a small position now. Later, I'd wait for additional signals to see where this market is likely heading.

2019-09-03 14:50:00,"CARACAS, Sept 3 (Reuters) - U.S. law firm Sullivan & Cromwell LLP will be the lead counsel for Venezuela's opposition as it seeks to restructure the country's foreign debt, opposition leader Juan Guaido's overseas legal representative said on Tuesday.

President Nicolas Maduro's government has defaulted on most of roughly $60 billion in foreign bonds issued by Venezuela and state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A., known as PDVSA, but has had minimal contact with creditors about addressing the situation. 

Guaido, the leader of the opposition-run Congress who has been recognized by more than 50 countries as Venezuela's rightful leader, is preparing for a negotiating process after Maduro leaves power. The legislature last month said it would form a commission to eventually renegotiate the debt. 

The law firm offered ""an accommodation on legal cost for an initial period"" due to the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, Guaido's office said in a statement posted on Twitter.

Sergio Galvis, Sullivan & Cromwell's head of Latin American and Sovereign Finance practices, and Jim Bromley, the co-head of the firm's Restructuring Group, will lead the negotiating team, according to the statement. 

Sullivan & Cromwell did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

2019-09-03 13:08:25,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Like the rest of its peers in the semiconductor industry, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) has had a bumpy year. Concerns about the ongoing trade war with China has cast a shadow over the industry for the foreseeable future, making it difficult to pick a winner. Aside from the trade war, however, AMD stock appears to be on track for a pretty solid future. .

But that doesn't mean you should rush out to buy AMD stock just yet

AMD has a lot going for itself right now. Its Ryzen processors are about to see an update, which is expected to boost the firm's performance significantly. The new 7-nanometer Ryzen CPUs are said to offer superior performance while using less power than competing chips - something that should help AMD continue to snatch marketshare away from its competitors.

The firm is also making major strides in the data center industry with its newest server processor, dubbed Rome. According to CEO Lisa Su, the chip has attracted a number of partners who are using it to develop their own platforms before it has even launched. Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) is also using AMD chips to power its servers , another big win for the firm. 

That's important because data centers are where semiconductor stocks are doing battle right now. Each firm - Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ), AMD, and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) - has its strengths, but they all claim their strong position in the data center business will be a growth catalyst over the next few years.

With the rise of cloud computing and Artificial Intelligence, there will be a rising wave of demand for better, faster and more efficient servers -  but it's still unclear who the winner will be. Right now, AMD stock is looking like a pretty solid frontrunner and if all goes well the firm could be on track to become the leader in that market.

Aside from data centers, AMD also has its hands in the gaming space. Falling demand for the firm's semi-custom chips hurt its Q2 results, but some believe the firm will make up for that come next year . That's because gaming consoles that use the chips have seen softer demand as players wait for new hardware to come out. The new consoles are due out in 2020, which means next year AMD should see demand for the semi-custom chips kick in.

After reading about so many positive growth catalysts, you might be wondering how I could possibly shy away from buying AMD stock. But if you buy now, you've missed out on the majority of the good news. All that I've written about above - and perhaps more - is already priced into Advanced Micro Devices stock. AMD's stock price is already more than 50% higher year-to-date - that's a lot to ask of a semiconductor stock in today's environment.

That means any tidbit of bad news could tip AMD stock over a cliff.

While AMD has largely bucked the trend within its industry when it comes to China trade rhetoric, that doesn't mean the firm will remain protected forever. News that a fresh round of tariffs have been implemented by the Trump administration suggests that tension between the U.S. and China will likely persist for the foreseeable future. Not only could that hurt AMD's future prospects, but it could create an economic downturn which would dampen the demand the firm is counting on in 2020.

Advanced Micro Devices looks like a solid semiconductor stock, and I'd certainly keep it on my radar to buy on a significant pullback over the next few months.

However, now isn't the time to add the firm to your portfolio because it looks unlikely to deliver much more in the remainder of 2019. Next year, could be a break out year for AMD stock if all goes as planned, especially if the trade tension with China starts to fizzle out.

Unfortunately, that's just too many ifs to justify AMD's share price right now, so I'd wait for a better entry point if you're looking to take a long-term position.

As of this writing Laura Hoy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Sept 3 (Reuters) - U.S. oil and gas producer Concho Resources Inc  said on Tuesday it would sell a portion of its New Mexico assets for $925 million to KKR-backed Spur Energy Partners LLC and plans to use the money to lower its debt and buyback shares.

The deal is the latest in the sector as oil and gas producers have been divesting non-core assets amid investor pressure to shore up their cash reserves for buybacks and dividends.

The company, the top oil producer in New Mexico, also said in a post earnings conference call in August that it did not plan to allocate capital to the assets for the next five years.

MUFG Securities Americas analyst Michael McAllister said while the sale isn't a ""game changer"" for Concho, it was a good deal as the company wasn't going to put much money into its New Mexico assets for a few years.

The assets, a narrow strip of about 100,000 gross acres bordering Concho's operations in the Delaware basin, produce about 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), the company said in a statement.

Analysts at Capital One Securities said the offer price was ""solid"", adding that such non-core property sales would help the lower the company's cash operating expense, currently at $9.83 per barrel of oil equivalent.

The proceeds from the deal will be used to pay down debt and initiate the share repurchase program of up to $1.5 billion, the company said. 

However, analysts at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey said Concho would need to show clear progress in its targeted cost goals before ""truly regaining credibility with the Street"" and questioned if the sale was the optimal longer term strategy.

The company's stock has already fallen more than 25% since it missed profit estimates for the third time in a row on July 31, leading to several brokerage cutting their price targets.

Shares of Concho were down 2.4% at $71.44 amid a broader sell off in energy stocks as oil prices tumbled on rising OPEC and Russian oil output as well as the protracted U.S.-China trade dispute.

2019-09-03 17:04:00," Shares of   Concho Resources    (NYSE: CXO)    cratered    last month after the company posted disappointing second-quarter   results. Not only did the   Permian Basin    -focused oil producer miss analysts' earnings expectations, but   it also cut its full-year forecast and reported disappointing   results for a well spacing test. That shellacking has sent shares   down more than 28% for the year even though    oil   prices    have rebounded nearly 16%. While Concho's second-quarter report was a disappointment, its   value proposition hasn't changed. As a result, the   energy company    is taking advantage of the decline in its stock price to buy back   a big chunk of its shares.   Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();  Jump-starting its buyback Concho Resources has shifted its priorities over the past   year. The company has gone from focusing on growing production as   fast as it can to living below its means so that it can generate   free cash flow. That has enabled the company to more quickly pay   down debt as well as   initiate a dividend    . It targeted to return even more money to shareholders in the   future as its free cash flow grew. However, with its stock price tumbling this year, Concho has   accelerated that plan, doing so by selling its legacy assets in   the New Mexico Shelf for $925 million. It plans to use 60% of   that money to pay off debt, which will enable it to achieve its   leverage target. It will use the rest to jump-start a share   buyback program, which it has initially set at $1.5 billion. The   company will fund the balance of its buyback with the increasing   free cash flow it expects to generate in the future. At its   current market value, that's enough money to retire more than 10%   of its outstanding stock. Following a well-known blueprint Concho Resources is the latest oil stock to authorize a   meaningful share repurchase program. It's doing so by following   the same acceleration strategy as its peers. U.S. oil giant   ConocoPhillips    (NYSE: COP) drew up the game plan toward the end of 2016. At the   time, ConocoPhillips aimed to sell $5 billion to $8 billion in   assets, which would give it the cash to pay down debt and   repurchase $3 billion in stock. It would go on to vastly   outperform its plan by selling more assets than expected. That   allowed it to pay down debt quickly, enabling it to generate more   free cash flow to buy back its shares. As a result,   ConocoPhillips is now on track to repurchase $15 billion of   stock, which could retire about 20% of its outstanding shares in   the coming years.      Meanwhile,   Devon Energy    (NYSE: DVN) has taken things even further. The company sold   several assets, which has narrowed its focus on four key regions.   That gave Devon Energy the cash to repurchase $4.4 billion of its   stock so far, which is 24% of its shares outstanding. The company   aims to buy back another $600 million by year-end, which could   push its share total down by 30% from its peak. More repurchases   are likely in the future since Devon now has a top-tier balance   sheet and a business that's generating increasing free cash   flow. Taking matters into its own hands Concho Resources' recent sell-off pushed its stock price into   bargain territory in the company's view. As a result, it's   selling assets so that it can repurchase shares. That will enable   the company to immediately gobble up some of its discounted   shares, which it hopes will create more value for its investors   over the long term.   10 stocks we like better than Concho Resources       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

That has enabled the company to more quickly pay   down debt as well as   initiate a dividend    . It targeted to return even more money to shareholders in the   future as its free cash flow grew.

However, with its stock price tumbling this year, Concho has   accelerated that plan, doing so by selling its legacy assets in   the New Mexico Shelf for $925 million. It plans to use 60% of   that money to pay off debt, which will enable it to achieve its   leverage target. It will use the rest to jump-start a share   buyback program, which it has initially set at $1.5 billion. The   company will fund the balance of its buyback with the increasing   free cash flow it expects to generate in the future. At its   current market value, that's enough money to retire more than 10%   of its outstanding stock.

Concho Resources is the latest oil stock to authorize a   meaningful share repurchase program. It's doing so by following   the same acceleration strategy as its peers. U.S. oil giant   ConocoPhillips    (NYSE: COP) drew up the game plan toward the end of 2016. At the   time, ConocoPhillips aimed to sell $5 billion to $8 billion in   assets, which would give it the cash to pay down debt and   repurchase $3 billion in stock. It would go on to vastly   outperform its plan by selling more assets than expected. That   allowed it to pay down debt quickly, enabling it to generate more   free cash flow to buy back its shares. As a result,   ConocoPhillips is now on track to repurchase $15 billion of   stock, which could retire about 20% of its outstanding shares in   the coming years.     

Meanwhile,   Devon Energy    (NYSE: DVN) has taken things even further. The company sold   several assets, which has narrowed its focus on four key regions.   That gave Devon Energy the cash to repurchase $4.4 billion of its   stock so far, which is 24% of its shares outstanding. The company   aims to buy back another $600 million by year-end, which could   push its share total down by 30% from its peak. More repurchases   are likely in the future since Devon now has a top-tier balance   sheet and a business that's generating increasing free cash   flow.

Concho Resources' recent sell-off pushed its stock price into   bargain territory in the company's view. As a result, it's   selling assets so that it can repurchase shares. That will enable   the company to immediately gobble up some of its discounted   shares, which it hopes will create more value for its investors   over the long term.

WASHINGTON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said on Tuesday that a Tesla Model S was in Autopilot mode and the driver's hands were off the wheel when it struck a fire truck in Culver City, California, one of a series of crashes the board is investigating involving Tesla's driver assistance system.

The 2014 Model S Autopilot system was engaged continuously for the final 13 minutes 48 seconds of the trip before the vehicle struck a fire truck parked on Interstate-405 in January 2018, the NTSB safety board said in documents posted on Tuesday.

The driver kept his hands off the wheel for all but 51 seconds of the final drive segment and received numerous alerts to place his hands back on the wheel, the documents showed. Tesla Inc  did not immediately comment.

The fire truck was unoccupied and the driver was not injured in the incident.

""I was having a coffee and a bagel. And all I remember, that truck, and then I just saw the boom in my face and that was it,"" the man behind the wheel told the NTSB.

The report says the Tesla was following a vehicle for an extended period at a speed of around 21 miles per hour (33.8 kph) when the vehicle ahead changed lanes seconds before the crash

After the vehicle in front shifted, the Tesla began accelerating toward the driver-set cruise control speed of 80 mph (129 kph) and hit the parked fire truck while going 30.9 mph. The system did not detect the driver's hands on the wheel for the final 3 minutes and 41 seconds of the crash.

He did not remember precisely what he was doing at the time of the crash but could have been changing the radio or drinking coffee. Records show the driver was not using his cellphone to text or talk at the time of the crash, the NTSB said.

Tesla's Autopilot was engaged during at least three fatal U.S. crashes, including fatal March 2018 crashes of a 2018 Model 3 in Delray Beach, Florida and in Mountain View, California of a Model X. Both of those crashes remain under investigation by the NTSB and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The agencies are also investigating other crashes and battery fires involving Tesla vehicles.

The crashes raised questions about the driver-assistance system's ability to detect hazards and has sparked concern about the safety of systems that can perform driving tasks for extended stretches of time with little or no human intervention, but which cannot completely replace human drivers.

While Tesla drivers say they are able to avoid holding the steering wheel for extended periods while using Autopilot, Tesla advises drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and pay attention while using the system.

In May 2016, a Tesla Model S driver was killed near Williston, Florida, while Autopilot was engaged, when he slammed into a tractor trailer.

The NTSB said in 2017 that Tesla lacked proper safeguards allowing the Florida driver ""to use the system outside of the environment for which it was designed and the system gave far too much leeway to the driver to divert his attention.""",NTSB says Autopilot engaged in 2018 California Tesla crash - Nasdaq.com,https://www.nasdaq.com/article/ntsb-says-autopilot-engaged-in-2018-california-tesla-crash-20190903-00920

All industries are competitive, but the semiconductor industry takes competition to the next level - something Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) investors know all too well.

Considering the headwinds facing the chip industry, namely the ongoing U.S.-China trade war , the almost 1.6% August gain posted by Nvidia stock is impressive. It's even more so when measured against a monthly decline of 0.35% for the widely followed iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX ).

Remember that late last month, various reports indicated that Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ), one of Nvidia's primary rivals, surpassed Nvidia for the first time since 2014 in terms of overall graphics card shipments? In that market, there are just three players, AMD, Nvidia and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ).

Jon Peddie Researchreported last week that in the second quarter, AMD took the lead in graphics processing unit shipments, up 9.8% quarter-over-quarter. Nvidia's shipments were flat and Intel's shipments dropped quarter-over-quarter.

As is the case with other areas of the semiconductor market, demand for the chips Nvidia specializes in can be volatile . Favorably for Nvidia stock, the company has been entering new arenas in an effort to rejuvenate its revenue stream.

Don't get too excited about Nvidia stock because it resides almost 43% below its 52-week high. Investors must acknowledge the company has some areas to address before NVDA can get its groove back. One of these areas is the data center space.

For the second quarter,  Morningstar  reported that NVDA's data center revenue was down 14% year-over-year. This revenue came in at $655 million, labeled ""unimpressive"" by sector strategist Abhinav Davuluri.

""Hyperscale spending was particularly poor but Nvidia expects the weakness to be short-lived, noting continued activity in AI engineering,"" Davuluri wrote.

Combine that with softness in the gaming business - a major driver of Nvidia's revenue - and the aforementioned rivalry with AMD, and there are spots management needs to address before Wall Street starts fawning over AMD again.

Those soft spots don't mean the case for Nvidia stock is dead. The company is establishing itself in some of the fastest-growing markets of tomorrow including artificial intelligence, robotics and self-driving cars.

Self-driving cars aren't on the road in significant numbers yet, currently accounting for a scant percentage of Nvidia's revenue. But that space could prove meaningful to the company's top line in the future.

""The firm views the car as a 'supercomputer on wheels,'"" said Morningstar's Davuluri . ""Although this segment currently contributes relatively little to the top line, we acknowledge the opportunity Nvidia has to grow its presence in cars beyond infotainment as drivers seek autonomous features in newer vehicles.""

Self-driving cars are one of many AI applications. The chips Nvidia is developing can potentially serve more uses throughout the burgeoning AI/robotics ecosystem, which is encouraging at a time of soaring demand for industrial robots . The company makes a chip it hails as the ""brains"" of robots.

In an Aug. 20 news release, the Robotics Industry Association announced that North American companies had ordered 8,752 robots. These robots have a cumulative value of $446 million.

For long-term investors considering Nvidia stock, it is encouraging that the company has some scale in the GPU market. This enables it to stem some of the demand ebbs and flows associated with the PC and gaming segments. The data center market is expected to boom and could represent half of Nvidia's revenue by 2023.

That's a positive, but investors should also demand that management continue its efforts to bolster revenue diversity. Management can do this by leveraging its superior switching costs to become a force in the self-driving automobile market.

Over the near term, a ""neutral""approach to Nvidia stock may be best unless the shares aggressively surpass the $170 range. Below $150, the stock could have downside to $130.

As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-03 11:32:55,"Investors in Etrade Financial Corporation (Symbol: ETFC) saw new options become available today, for the October 11th expiration. At Stock Options Channel  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ETFC options chain for the new October 11th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.    The put contract at the $40.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.18. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $40.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $38.82 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ETFC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $40.98/share today. Because the $40.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 62%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.95% return on the cash commitment, or 28.34% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost  .  makeArticleAd();  Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Etrade Financial Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $40.00 strike is located relative to that history:       Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $41.50 strike price has a current bid of $1.43. If an investor was to purchase shares of ETFC stock at the current price level of $40.98/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $41.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.76% if the stock gets called away at the October 11th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ETFC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Etrade Financial Corporation, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing ETFC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $41.50 strike highlighted in red:    Considering the fact that the $41.50 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 53%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.49% boost of extra return to the investor, or 33.52% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost  .    The implied volatility in the put contract example is 32%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 31%.    Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $40.98) to be 29%.

VIENNA, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Austrian sensor specialist AMS  made a 4.3 billion euro($4.8 billion) counter-offer for larger German lighting group Osram  on Tuesday, raising the prospect of a bidding war with private equity duo Bain Capital and Carlyle .

AMS made its 38.50 euro($42.90) per share offer for Osram, which is 10% above the price offered by the buyout firms, after approval from German finance watchdog Bafin, adding that the acceptance period will run from Sept. 3 until Oct. 1.

A spokesman for Bain and Carlyle declined to comment on Tuesday following the bid by AMS.

AMS, which makes a large part of its revenues from sensors for the face recognition technology in the latest iPhones but wants to reduce its dependence on Apple , is interested in Osram's technologies for self-driving cars and wants to create a global power in sensors and photonics.

Osram shareholders who have already decided to tender for the private equity groups' offer of 35 euros per share can withdraw and retender, AMS said.

Both bidders have provided for a minimum acceptance threshold of 70%.

""Our offer and the combination of Osram and AMS represents a better option to all stakeholders than the private equity proposal,"" AMS Chief Executive Alexander Everke said.

The AMS bid includes a 4.2 billion euro bridging loan facility underwritten by UBS  and HSBC , which AMS plans to refinance by issuing debt and equity.

SHARES RISE 

Osram shares gained as much as 2.3% but did not rise above 37.20 euros. Shares in Swiss-listed AMS rose 1.9%, still 10 Swiss francs below the closing price before it detailed its takeover plans last month.

The transaction, if successful, would be the largest purchase in AMS's history. In the 1990s, the group had miscalculated with two acquisitions in Germany and South Africa and had to sell the businesses later at a loss.

Osram, whose lightbulbs were once ubiquitous in European homes, got into difficulties with a strategy to reinvent itself as a high-tech photonics company that included several acquisitions and a billion-euro investment in Asia.

Under Everke, who took the helm three years ago, AMS has focused on buying new technologies. Its largest acquisition so far was the purchase of Singapore-based sensor maker Heptagon in 2016 for $855 million.

Analysts said the combination of AMS's and Osram's lidar systems - sensors that use laser light pulses to render precise images of the environment around a car - would make sense.

However, it might take several years until these systems bring solid revenue flows, IHS Markit analyst Dexin Chen said.

Investors also questioned how the Austrian company, which has 8,500 employees, will be able to integrate the German group, which last year had more than 24,200 staff working in more than 120 countries and at 27 production facilities worldwide.

2019-09-03 09:37:00,"  For Immediate Release  Chicago, IL - September 3, 2019 - Zacks Equity Research  PC Connection, Inc. CNXN  as the Bull of the Day, Camping World Holdings, Inc. CWH  as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Apple AAPL  , Goldman Sachs GS  and Verizon VZ  . Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:   Bull of the Day  :  Headquartered in Merrimack, New Hampshire, PC Connection, Inc. directly markets brand-name personal computers and related equipment, software, and networking products to business, education, and consumer customers throughout the United States.  Q2 Earnings Better-Than-Expected  Earnings of 89 cents easily beat the Zacks Consensus of 70 cents per share, and net income hit a quarterly record of $23.7 million, growing nearly 30% year-over-year. Revenue of $741 million also surpassed our consensus estimate, up about 5% from the year-ago quarter. Breaking it down by segment, Business Solutions saw sales of $271.1 million thanks to strong growth in sales of desktops, servers/storage, and software products. Public Sector Solutions hit revenue of $152 million, an increase of 12.2%, while Enterprise Solutions grew by 5.6% to $318 million. PC Connection's largest category, notebook/mobility sales, grew 14% year-over-year and accounted for 29% of net sales in Q2. ""Our increased productivity and improved execution allowed us to deliver a 31.3% increase in diluted earnings per share,"" said CEO and President Tim McGrath. ""The Company achieved record gross profit, gross margin, and net income this quarter.""  PC Connection Price and Consensus  Year-to-date, CNXN stock is up around 19.5%. Estimates have been rising lately too, pushing the stocks towards a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). For the current fiscal year, PC Connection's earnings growth is expected to grow 15.19% year-over-year. Two analysts have revised their estimate upwards in the past 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has moved 23 cents higher from $2.50 to $2.73 during the same time frame. 2020 looks pretty strong too, and earnings are expected to grow about 4.2%; next year's consensus estimate sits at $2.85 cents per share, with eight upward revisions and up by 19 cents in the last 60 days.  Bottom Line  As more people, businesses, and governments look to expand their digital presence, it will be companies like PC Connection that will more in demand in ever, especially as technologies like cloud computing, AI, ""Big Data,"" and blockchain grow. If you're an investor looking for a broad retail stock to add to your portfolio, make sure to keep CNXN on your shortlist.  Bear of the Day  : Camping World Holdings, Inc. is the go-to company for RV enthusiasts, providing services, protection plans, products, and resources for customers; its brands include Camping World and Good Sam. The company offers new and used RVs for sale, vehicle service, and maintenance through its retail locations and membership clubs.  Q2 Earnings Disappoint, Shares Plunge  Last month, Camping World reported second-quarter results that came in well below analyst expectations, and shares fell over 13% on the report. Earnings of 45 cents missed the Zacks Consensus of 64 cents. Revenue of $1.47 billion, though, managed to just beat our consensus of $1.45 billion and grow 2.3% year-over-year. The company's biggest issue that it currently faces is weakness in the overall RV market. During Q2, sales of new vehicles fell 6.3% to 22,900, while average selling prices were about flat. Despite hope after its Q1 report that there could be signs of a turnaround on the horizon, investors, once they saw the Q2 numbers, began to realize that maybe that wouldn't be the case for Camping World. In a post-  earnings call  with invetsors, CEO Marcus A. Lemonis said that ""As a management team, we've spent considerable time looking at multiple scenarios and have concluded that for purposes for full year 2019 guidance, we must assume that the current market conditions and uncertainties will continue.""  Falling Estimates  Analysts have turned bearish on Camping World, with six cutting estimates in the last 60 days for the current fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has dropped drastically, down 68 cents during that same time period from $1.17 to $0.42 per share; earnings could now see a roughly 70% year-over-year decline for fiscal 2019. This sentiment has stretched into 2020, and our consensus estimate has dropped 60 cents in the past two months as well. CWH is now a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).  Bottom Line  Shares of CWH are down almost 39% since January, and have fallen around 63% in the past one-year period. It's going to take a lot of patience for current shareholders to continue holding on to Camping World. But right now, it looks better stay away, since consumers seem to be steering away from RVs and the company itself is not too confident in a quick turnaround plan.   Can Apple's (AAPL) New Credit Card Succeed?     Apple announced earlier this year that they would be offering a credit card in partnership with Goldman Sachs. Users are able to sign up for the credit card through their phones and access the card in just minutes. Apple issues their card holders a sleek titanium card for instances when an institution doesn't accept Apple Pay. The new card is a step into uncharted territory for both companies. Apple is trying to develop a new revenue stream beyond its hardware products, and Goldman Sachs is continuing its push into consumer financial products with the Apple card. However, skeptics point to how mobile payments has not caught on in the US like it has in other countries. Let's take a closer look into the card and the obstacles it will have to overcome to succeed.  Putting the Pressure on Wireless Carriers  The tech giant's move into banking could enable it to provide customers with financing on new iPhone models. If Apple were to reach this point, it would break off its relationships with wireless carriers like Verizon. Wireless carriers sell expensive new phones to consumers in installment plans that are added to their monthly bill. The customers are then locked into the carrier until the phone is paid off. The Apple card paired with the SIM technology can make it easier for customers to switch between wireless carriers. On top of all that, the card pays 2% cash back on Apple Pay transactions, 3% on direct Apple purchases, and 1% on purchases made with the physical card. Apple emphasizes privacy and security on the card; Apple does not know what you bought, how much you paid, or where you bought it. The analytics for spending are done on the device, not in Apple servers. Furthermore, Goldman will not sell purchase data to third parties. Apple Pay is accepted by more than 70% of US retailers and is projected to work in more than 40 countries by the end of 2019. Additionally, Apple CEO Tim Cook stated that ""Apple Pay will work in the mass transit systems of Portland, Chicago, and New York later this year.""  Mobile Payments Have Struggled in US  Despite increasing smartphone dependence, most Americans are still not using their smartphones to pay for things. This isn't the case for countries like India and China where they are experiencing a massive increase in mobile purchases. In China, smartphone payments made up more than 80% of all purchases in the country in 2018. The US had adoption rates of mobile payment apps of less than 10%. Experts see the lack of interest in mobile payments and other rewards cards as major headwinds for the Apple credit card. The lack of mobile payments is an anomaly, as over 81% of Americans own a smartphone. A major reason phones became the go to payment option in China and India is because cash was the only other, far less attractive, option. Both countries were cash dependent economies and mobile payments provided people with a much more convenient method of payment. India's government encouraged digital financial transactions in order to stimulate tax revenue, as cash payments often happen under the table.

The company offers new and used RVs for sale, vehicle service, and maintenance through its retail locations and membership clubs.

Earnings of 45 cents missed the Zacks Consensus of 64 cents. Revenue of $1.47 billion, though, managed to just beat our consensus of $1.45 billion and grow 2.3% year-over-year.

The company's biggest issue that it currently faces is weakness in the overall RV market. During Q2, sales of new vehicles fell 6.3% to 22,900, while average selling prices were about flat.

Analysts have turned bearish on Camping World, with six cutting estimates in the last 60 days for the current fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has dropped drastically, down 68 cents during that same time period from $1.17 to $0.42 per share; earnings could now see a roughly 70% year-over-year decline for fiscal 2019.

This sentiment has stretched into 2020, and our consensus estimate has dropped 60 cents in the past two months as well.

CWH is now a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

 Bottom Line 

Shares of CWH are down almost 39% since January, and have fallen around 63% in the past one-year period.

It's going to take a lot of patience for current shareholders to continue holding on to Camping World. But right now, it looks better stay away, since consumers seem to be steering away from RVs and the company itself is not too confident in a quick turnaround plan.

Both countries were cash dependent economies and mobile payments provided people with a much more convenient method of payment. India's government encouraged digital financial transactions in order to stimulate tax revenue, as cash payments often happen under the table.

CHICAGO, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The head of global airlines lobby IATA warned on Tuesday that a discrepancy among global regulators over reapproving Boeing Co's  737 MAX for commercial flight could set a worrying precedent for future aircraft programs.

The MAX, Boeing's newest single-aisle aircraft, was grounded worldwide in March after two deadly crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia within five months. Boeing is updating flight control software at the center of both crashes that must be approved by regulators before the planes can fly commercially again.

But global regulators have indicated they would pursue their own analysis of the 737 MAX and Boeing's proposed updates, rather than simply following the FAA, which has suffered a dent to its credibility following the two crashes.

""With the 737 MAX we are a bit worried ... because we don't see the normal unanimity among international regulators that should be the case,"" Alexandre de Juniac, IATA director general, told reporters ahead of a summit in Chicago.

""We see a discrepancy that's detrimental to the industry.""

In an emailed statement, the FAA said it has a ""transparent and collaborative relationship"" with other civil aviation authorities as it continues its review of changes to software on the Boeing 737 MAX.

""Each government will make its own decision to return the aircraft to service based on a thorough safety assessment,"" the agency said.

U.S. airlines are scheduling without the 737 MAX into December or early next year, taking a financial hit while the jets remain grounded. 

Boeing is targeting regulatory approval for the fixes and new pilot training in October, though the FAA reiterated on Tuesday it does not have a firm timeline to put the jets back in the air.

""Our first priority is safety, and we have set no timeframe for when the work will be completed,"" it said. 

The Montreal-based IATA has hosted two summits about the 737 MAX that have included the participation of international airlines, Boeing, the FAA and other regulators.

If regulators do wish to change the single certification process, de Juniac urged them to it ""collectively.""",IATA chief 'worried' about global regulators' discrepancy over Boeing 737 MAX - Nasdaq.com,https://www.nasdaq.com/article/iata-chief-worried-about-global-regulators-discrepancy-over-boeing-737-max-20190903-01010

 The Business 

Slack's goal is to make email obsolete, to be the next universally used organizational communication platform. The company currently has over 10 million daily active users across the globe, and this figure continues to proliferate. 

Slack's topline is expected to grow 50% this year and close to 40% the following 2 years.

I believe that their room for all of these email killing businesses to grow with business communication needs becoming increasingly diverse. The future of this space has a lot of expansion ahead.

 The Direct Listing 

Slack entered the market in a very unconventional way, listing its shares directly on the New York Stock Exchange. A direct listing differs from a traditional IPO in that an investment bank is not underwriting the shares.

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.    In trading on Tuesday, shares of Envestnet Inc (Symbol: ENV) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 29.3, after changing hands as low as $56.63 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF ( SPY  ) is 48.1. A bullish investor could look at ENV's 29.3 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. The chart below shows the one year performance of ENV shares:     Looking at the chart above, ENV's low point in its 52 week range is $46.57 per share, with $73.94 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $56.47.  makeArticleAd();   Find out what 9 other oversold stocks you need to   know about »

2019-09-03 12:45:00,"Jumia's (NYSE: JMIA) public life is only a few months old. Founded in 2012, the online African merchant went public in April 2019. Investors compared Jumia with Amazon  in the U.S. and MercadoLibre in Latin America and rushed to invest. Consequently, the stock price climbed as high as $52 per share from the IPO price of $14.5.

Shortly after the IPO, Citron Research, a well-known short-seller, published a controversial report that referred to several unverified discrepancies in the company's reported numbers to accuse Jumia of significant fraud. Since then, Jumia's stock price is significantly lower than its short-lived, all-time high level, and even fell under the IPO price. Now that IPO excitement subsided, it's time to dig in and decide whether Jumia is worthy of its almighty title of the Amazon of Africa.

Source: YCharts

The company's business is broken into three parts: an e-commerce marketplace, online delivery logistics, and an online payment platform. It operates across 14 countries in Africa, and more than 50% of its revenue comes from Nigeria and Egypt. What's more, less than 1% of African commerce happens online, making Jumia's opportunity for growth massive. But according to the company's Q2 2019 earnings report , Jumia burns $277 million to run its operations and has $379 million in cash and equivalents to fund them. In other words, Jumia has slightly more than one year's worth of its operating costs in the bank, before needing to raise money. Can Jumia raise the funds it needs to grow?

With its brand damages and controversies, a secondary public offering may not be possible any time soon. But during its IPO, Mastercard (NYSE: MA) invested more than $50 million in the company. Jumia still has the option to raise money from more significant players like Mastercard that may want to leverage the opportunity as a gateway to enter Africa.

Jumia's first competitive moat is its scale and presence across Africa. With almost five million users and 81,000 sellers, it's not difficult to imagine large international brands leveraging Jumia as a way to break into Africa. We've seen a similar model to work in China .

Jumia also has an asset-light model. Jumia has a partnership with Vivo Energy- Shell 's licensee in Africa. The company's sellers and customers can drop off, pick up, and even pay for their orders across Vivo Energy's locations. Having an already established network of sites to pay and pick up orders is a unique way to eliminate the need for operating a delivery fleet.

Image Source: Getty Images

The company still has the option of growing through digital-only transactions. Online-only orders such as paying for bills, purchasing music, or buying airline tickets, for example, do not need to be delivered physically but maintain a firm place within an African consumer base.

Also, Jumia's comprehensive technology platform connects banks and financial institutions to sellers and consumers. While JumiaPay handles e-commerce transactions, it also operates as a marketplace for other financial products such as loan and financing services. Jumia makes a commission off of those connections. It seems that the company has a few sources of revenue to continue its rapid growth.

Despite what Citron wants investors to believe, trailblazing in the e-commerce and online payment market, especially when there is a lack of digital and physical delivery infrastructure, is inevitably prone to fraud. Early users of PayPal may remember the large-scale fraudulent activities on the platform. Fraud incidences are predictable and understandable in such early stages of significant shifts in consumer behavior away from the status quo. The way the company solves those issues matters more than the fact that such fraudulent incidents are widespread in the company's core market.

Assuming that Jumia is leading the African consumers' transition to the digital economy, it is going to grow significantly larger than its current billion-dollar valuation. The company has a large-enough scale that can develop further through digital-only transactions and local partnerships with existing brick and mortar facilities. Institutional and corporate investors can use Jumia to access the African market, and as such, they may be willing to fund its path to becoming the Amazon of Africa.

However, the growth phase is going to take a long time to pan. That's not bad news, as some may assume. A lengthy growth phase means that there will be an extended period (think in years) for savvy investors to pick up a few shares. I don't own Jumia's shares yet, but I'm closely monitoring the company's progress. As they say, good things come to those with patience. Jumia has what it takes to be the Amazon of Africa, but the path to get there is long and arduous.

2019-09-03 12:58:00,"By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said on Tuesday that a Tesla Model S was in Autopilot mode and the driver's hands were off the wheel when it struck a fire truck in Culver City, California, one of a series of crashes the board is investigating involving Tesla's driver assistance system.

The 2014 Model S Autopilot system was engaged continuously for the final 13 minutes 48 seconds of the trip before the vehicle struck a fire truck parked on Interstate-405 in January 2018, the NTSB safety board said in documents posted on Tuesday.

The driver kept his hands off the wheel for all but 51 seconds of the final drive segment and received numerous alerts to place his hands back on the wheel, the documents showed. Tesla Inc  did not immediately comment.

The fire truck was unoccupied and the driver was not injured in the incident.

""I was having a coffee and a bagel. And all I remember, that truck, and then I just saw the boom in my face and that was it,"" the man behind the wheel told the NTSB.

The report says the Tesla was following a vehicle for an extended period at a speed of around 21 miles per hour (33.8 kph) when the vehicle ahead changed lanes seconds before the crash

After the vehicle in front shifted, the Tesla began accelerating toward the driver-set cruise control speed of 80 mph (129 kph) and hit the parked fire truck while going 30.9 mph. The system did not detect the driver's hands on the wheel for the final 3 minutes and 41 seconds of the crash.

He did not remember precisely what he was doing at the time of the crash but could have been changing the radio or drinking coffee. Records show the driver was not using his cellphone to text or talk at the time of the crash, the NTSB said.

Tesla's Autopilot was engaged during at least three fatal U.S. crashes, including fatal March 2018 crashes of a 2018 Model 3 in Delray Beach, Florida and in Mountain View, California of a Model X. Both of those crashes remain under investigation by the NTSB and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The agencies are also investigating other crashes and battery fires involving Tesla vehicles.

The crashes raised questions about the driver-assistance system's ability to detect hazards and has sparked concern about the safety of systems that can perform driving tasks for extended stretches of time with little or no human intervention, but which cannot completely replace human drivers.

While Tesla drivers say they are able to avoid holding the steering wheel for extended periods while using Autopilot, Tesla advises drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and pay attention while using the system.

In May 2016, a Tesla Model S driver was killed near Williston, Florida, while Autopilot was engaged, when he slammed into a tractor trailer.

The NTSB said in 2017 that Tesla lacked proper safeguards allowing the Florida driver ""to use the system outside of the environment for which it was designed and the system gave far too much leeway to the driver to divert his attention.""",Tesla Autopilot engaged in 2018 California crash; driver's hands off wheel -NTSB - Nasdaq.com,https://www.nasdaq.com/article/tesla-autopilot-engaged-in-2018-california-crash-drivers-hands-off-wheel-ntsb-20190903-00996
2019-09-03 13:46:20,"Legendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.    In trading on Tuesday, shares of New Relic Inc (Symbol: NEWR) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 28.9, after changing hands as low as $56.37 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF ( SPY  ) is 48.1. A bullish investor could look at NEWR's 28.9 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. The chart below shows the one year performance of NEWR shares:     Looking at the chart above, NEWR's low point in its 52 week range is $54.83 per share, with $113.3391 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $56.22.  makeArticleAd();   Find out what 9 other oversold stocks you need to   know about »

For the SPDR Russell 1000 Low Volatility Focus ETF (Symbol: ONEV), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $87.06 per unit.      With ONEV trading at a recent price near $79.28 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.82% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of ONEV's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Ally Financial Inc (Symbol: ALLY), Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc. (Symbol: FBHS), and Hospitality Properties Trust (Symbol: HPT). Although ALLY has traded at a recent price of $31.35/share, the average analyst target is 15.56% higher at $36.23/share. Similarly, FBHS has 13.06% upside from the recent share price of $51.06 if the average analyst target price of $57.73/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting HPT to reach a target price of $27.00/share, which is 11.85% above the recent price of $24.14.

Sept 3 (Reuters) - Gold rose more than 1% on Tuesday after weak manufacturing data from the United States reinforced fears of an economic downturn, while uncertainties over U.S.-China trade ties and Brexit further boosted bullion's safe-haven appeal.

Meanwhile, silver  followed gold's rally and rose 3.7% while breaching the $19 mark for the first time since October 2016 at $19.14 per ounce.

U.S. gold futures  settled up 1.7% to $1,555.90.

Renewing fears of a sharp economic slowdown and weighing on risk sentiment, U.S. manufacturing activity contracted for the first time in three years in August. MKTS/GLOB

Weak manufacturing data ""will further embolden the view that the U.S. Federal Reserve is going to need to be aggressive with rate cuts,"" said Ryan McKay, a commodity strategist at TD Securities.

""Equities are on the back foot, that's what's keeping gold higher. There's a lot of uncertainty on the Brexit front, politics in Italy, protests in Hong Kong as well - a lot of stuff that's positive for gold.""

Gold also shook off mild pressure from the dollar earlier in the session, with the U.S. unit holding gains versus other major currencies. USD/

""Dollar is also being seen as a safe-haven asset ... Even Treasuries are up, dollar is up, silver is up, gold is up - it's all the safe-haven assets up together,"" said Phillip Streible, senior commodities strategist at RJO Futures.

Meanwhile, European currencies such as the euro and pound have dipped against the dollar as traders remain wary of developments surrounding Britain's potentially imminent exit from the European Union and Italy's political turmoil.

In Britain, lawmakers began a bid to stop Prime Minister Boris Johnson from pursuing a no-deal Brexit. 

On the trade front, China has lodged a complaint at the World Trade Organization over U.S. import duties, trashing the latest tariff actions as violating the consensus reached by leaders of both countries at a meeting in Osaka. 

""Gold has aggressively priced in Fed rate cuts. With little opportunity cost in holding gold and growing economic uncertainty tied to escalating U.S.-China trade tensions, investor appetite for the yellow metal has grown,"" BNP Paribas analysts wrote in a note, forecasting average gold prices to climb above $1,600 driven by the Fed's monetary easing cycle.

Federal fund futures  implied traders saw a 91% chance of a 25 basis-point rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve this month.

Meanwhile, platinum  rose 2.3% to $951.35 per ounce after reaching $956.99, its highest since March 2018.

2019-09-03 09:40:00,"The Boeing (NYSE: BA) 737 MAX still needs to clear a few hurdles before it can return to service. However, over the past two months, Boeing has made significant progress toward finalizing software fixes for the issues identified by the FAA and other aviation regulators. This has kept the Boeing 737 MAX on track for an official FAA validation flight sometime next month.

That said, even an October validation flight probably wouldn't leave enough time for airlines to put their 737 MAX fleets back into service by early November -- as United Airlines (NASDAQ: UAL) and American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL) had been planning until recently. As a result, both airline giants recently removed all 737 MAX flights from their schedules until December.

Two major airlines are extending their 737 MAX flight cancellations into December. Image source: Boeing.

As of mid-July, United Airlines had hoped to put its Boeing 737 MAX jets back into service on Nov. 3. However, in the face of uncertainty about the timeline for recertifying the 737 MAX, the carrier announced late last week that it would remove the troubled model from its schedules until Dec. 19. It will cancel nearly 100 flights a day during this period.

American Airlines followed suit on Sunday morning. The world's largest airline extended its 737 MAX flight cancellations from Nov. 2 to Dec. 3. This will force it to cancel an average of about 140 flights per day during the month of November.

While American Airlines remains slightly more optimistic than United about when the Boeing 737 MAX will return, there is little practical difference between the two airlines' recent schedule changes. Neither one will have the 737 MAX available for the busy Thanksgiving travel weekend, but both still hope to get the aircraft back in service in time for the peak season around Christmas. The period in between those two holidays tends to be one of the slowest times of the year for airlines.

Canceling flights over the Thanksgiving long weekend will lead to lost profits , particularly for American Airlines. Whereas United has expanded its fleet significantly during 2019, American will end 2019 with fewer mainline aircraft than it had at the beginning of the year, even if the Boeing 737 MAX were to be ungrounded. This is largely due to the carrier's decision to retire its aging fleet of MD-80s this week.

As recently as a week ago, American Airlines officials stated that they were confident that the Boeing 737 MAX would reenter service before year-end. However, nothing is guaranteed until the FAA actually recertifies the aircraft and approves new pilot training procedures. The FAA and other global aviation regulators are still demanding more information from Boeing, which suggests that there is a real risk that the return to service will be delayed longer than Boeing and many airline officials expect.

American Airlines will have to fly a reduced schedule over Thanksgiving weekend this year. Image source: American Airlines.

Maintaining an aggressive schedule for getting the Boeing 737 MAX back would potentially enable American and United to carry more passengers around Thanksgiving. The problem is that if the plane is not ready by then, the airlines could be forced to cancel flights at the last minute, alienating impacted customers. Last-minute cancellations during a holiday period would be particularly disruptive, because it would be hard to find space to rebook on other flights.

Airlines seem to have universally decided that canceling flights preemptively is the lesser of the two evils. That means Boeing needs to get its act together and move quickly over the next month or two to assure airlines that the 737 MAX will be ready to fly in December. Otherwise, United Airlines and American Airlines could give up on getting the 737 MAX back in time for Christmas and extend their preemptive cancellations into January.

2019-09-03 09:40:00," Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn't want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value? One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let's put SINOPEC Shangai Petrochemical Company, Ltd. SHI  stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:  PE Ratio  A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar o f earnings  in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock's current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole. On this front, SINOPEC Shangai has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 7.23, as you can see in the chart below:    This level actually compares quite favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 18.02. Also, if we focus on the long-term PE trend, SINOPEC Shangai's current PE level puts it slightly below its midpoint of 7.36 over the past five years.    The stock's PE compares quite favorably with the Basic Materials Market's trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 13.98. This indicates that the stock is undervalued right now, compared to its peers.    Meanwhile, SINOPEC Shangai has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year's earnings) of 3.70, which much lower than the current level. So, it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for SINOPEC Shangai stock in the near term too.  P/S Ratio  Another key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock's price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings. Right now, SINOPEC Shangai has a P/S ratio of just 0.2. This is quite lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.17x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.     Broad Value Outlook  In aggregate, SINOPEC Shangai currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes SINOPEC Shangai a solid choice for value investors.  What About the Stock Overall?  Though SINOPEC Shangai might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of A. This gives SHI a Zacks VGM score - or its overarching fundamental grade - of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>  ) Meanwhile, the company's recen t earnings  estimates have been bullish. The current year has seen no estimate go down in the past sixty days compared to one upward revision, while the next year estimate has seen no down and one up in the same time period. This has had a positive effect on the consensus estimate. While the current-year consensus estimate shot up 9.7% over the past two months, the next-year estimate has climbed 12.7%.

2019-09-03 07:47:00,"LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - EDF Energy has extended an outage at the Hunterston B-7 reactor on the west coast of Scotland to Jan. 15, 2020 from a previously scheduled Oct. 1, the British arm of French utility EDF  said on its website.

It has been offline since March 2018 after routine inspections found cracks in its graphite core. Its restart has been delayed several times since.

Before the reactor can restart Britain'sOffice for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) must be satisfied with the company's safety case, showing the reactor would be safe to operate even in the unlikely event of an earthquake.

The other reactor at the plant, which is more than 40 years old, was given approval to restart power production last month.

2019-09-03 09:05:00,"There comes a time when a longtime growth darling burns out. Sirius XM Holdings (NASDAQ: SIRI)  seems to be -- on the surface -- nearing the end of its rock star days.

User growth is slowing, with total subscribers rising a mere 2.5% over the past year. The acquisition of Pandora earlier this year is inflating top-line results in the near term, but if it wasn't for that timely purchase, this would be the fifth consecutive year of sluggish single-digit growth. Revenue gains have decelerated in five of the past six years.

One can argue that you haven't peaked if you're still taking steps in the right direction, but bears have long argued that the trends are not Sirius XM's friends. Auto sales are tailing off, particularly among younger drivers, who would fuel the next generation of its subscribers.

You also have a growing percentage of vehicles on the road raising the bar as connected cars, allowing drivers to bypass pricey premium radio subscriptions and instead stream podcasts and cheaper music services right from their Bluetooth-enabled smartphones.

Then we get to the stock. It has been one of the hottest over the past decade, and it's been surprisingly consistent on an annual basis. You have to go all the way back to 2008 to find a year in which Sirius XM shares didn't deliver positive results. The stock is on track to stretch that streak to 11 consecutive years of investor gains, but it's not beating the market in 2019. It's starting to feel mortal, but this doesn't mean that this is the end of the party.

Howard Stern and co-host Robin Quivers with Madonna, a guest on his Sirius XM show. Image source: Sirius XM Holdings.

Let's try to mow down some of the skepticism. It's true that growth is decelerating, and that's not a surprise for a company that until now has been limited by the reach of its satellites and already has more than 34.3 million subscribers. But that's not the only lever it has to boost its business.

Average revenue per user has risen 4% over the past year, padding subscriber growth. Sirius XM has been able to improve its monetization by passing through rising music royalties, and now with Pandora in its arsenal, it will have yet another way to upsell subscribers on more full-featured plans. Pricing elasticity may get tested -- especially if consumers and investors alike brace for a recession -- but there's no denying the appeal of the platform on its commercial-saddled channels to marketers trying to reach an audience of folks with disposable income.

Trends in car ownership and connected cars are problematic, but this is also why the Pandora deal was so important. Sirius XM now has a strong position in streaming audio, a good place to be with the mobile revolution on the rise. Satellite radio will continue to be a cash cow, delivering high-quality programming to drivers who love the convenience of a traditional dashboard experience. Even if that platform peaks, it will continue to bankroll growth through Pandora and other initiatives. It's just scratching the surface on that front.

The past decade has been ridiculously rewarding for Sirius XM investors, and those aren't the kind of gains that investors can expect in the years ahead. But it is now a steady, quarterly dividend-paying media giant that will likely have a few tricks up its sleeve if subscriber trends ever max out. We're not at peak Sirius XM. We may not even be close to a peak if we approach it (with all due apologies to its star Howard Stern) as the king of all media.

2019-09-03 20:06:00,"Sept 4 (Reuters) - Oil and gas explorer Carnarvon Petroleum Ltd  said on Wednesday that drilling results from the Dorado-3 appraisal well in Western Australia confirmed oil and gas reserves.

The wireline logging well has successfully confirmed a hydrocarbon bearing reservoir within the Caley, Baxter and Crespin intervals, the company said in a statement.

""The Dorado-3 well is important in providing critical flow test and fluid data to underpin field development planning and a final investment decision to progress to development,"" Carnarvon Managing Director Adrian Cook said.

Carnarvon in August last year said the Dorado oil find was estimated to hold 171 million barrels of proven and probable light oil reserves, making it the third biggest oil find off Western Australia. 

Carnarvon owns a 20% stake in the field, with the rest held by Santos Ltd  after it acquired Quadrant Energy in 2018. 

In June, Santos announced drilling results for the Dorado-2 appraisal well, with the company's Managing Director and Chief Executive Kevin Gallagher saying the results indicted that the Dorado discovery was ""larger than anticipated"".

2019-09-03 11:56:54,"The DividendRank  formula at Dividend Channel  ranks a coverage universe of thousands of  dividend stocks  , according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics - strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive. CBS Corp (Symbol: CBS) presently has an above average rank, in the top 50% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most ""interesting"" ideas that merit further research by investors.    But making CBS Corp an even more interesting and timely stock to look at, is the fact that in trading on Tuesday, shares of CBS entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $40.67 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30. In the case of CBS Corp, the RSI reading has hit 28.8 - by comparison, the universe of dividend stocks covered by Dividend Channel  currently has an average RSI of 46.5. A falling stock price - all else being equal - creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield. Indeed, CBS's recent annualized dividend of 0.72/share (currently paid in quarterly installments) works out to an annual yield of 1.71% based upon the recent $42.06 share price.    A bullish investor could look at CBS's 28.8 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. Among the fundamental datapoints dividend investors should investigate to decide if they are bullish on CBS is its dividend history. In general, dividends are not always predictable; but, looking at the history chart below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.  makeArticleAd();        Click here to find out what 9 other oversold   dividend stocks you need to know about »

2019-09-03 09:23:42,"Gold is being underpinned by the news as another set of tariffs for Chinese products took into effect with the new month, and political problems in the United Kingdom are heading to a hard Brexit outcome; however, the USD is containing gains in the gold as it is also joining its safe-haven status.

Hey FX Emperors, as Hurricane Dorian is approaching my desk, the market is trading under pressure by different news that are hurting the sentiment.

Risk aversion is the theme of the day as investors are battling against multiple levels of uncertainty. Besides the mentioned trade war and Brexit topics, the economic uncertainty in the European Union with its German engine losing steam is fueling fears of a possible recession.

In that framework, gold and silver are trading higher, but so does the dollar index, which is trading positive for the fifth straight day. DXY is at fresh highs since May 2017 at 99.40.

Dollar is positive as the British sterling and the euro are trading down on the day. Too many uncertainties around those two currencies due to recession and fears of a no-deal Brexit. Both the Euro and Pound are trading at multi-year lows against the greenback.

Gold is trading positive for the second day on Tuesday as investors are trading on risk aversion mode due to political and economic concerns. The positive side is, however, contained by a strong dollar.

The metal recovered from early losses on the day as the unit found support at 1,520 and it started to regain ground with the opening of the European session. Then, gold rallied to test the 1,535 area, where the price is now.

Gold is currently trading 0.25% positive on the day at 1,535. The unit is consolidating levels above the now critical 1,520 support. Technical conditions in the short term suggest a consolidation phase in the next hours. But the overall picture suggests additional gains.

FX Empire analyst James Hyerczyk highlights the role of US bond yields in gold's forecast. ""Gold is likely to remain underpinned on Tuesday as long as Treasury yields remain under pressure and stocks weaken. However, gains are likely to remain limited by the stronger U.S. Dollar, which tends to reduce foreign demand for dollar-denominated gold.""

If you are a bull, 1,535 is the level you need to watch, above it, 1,545 would be the next selling area. Then, August 29 high at 1,555.

To the downside, the unit is well supported by the 1,520. However, if the level is broken, 1,510 is the next frontier.

Silver is trading positive for the third session in a row as investors are buying the metal as an alternative of gold.

Early in the day, XAG/USD traded in consolidation mode around 18.50, but with the beginning of the American morning, it broke above the 18.60 critical resistance. The unit is now moving above August 29 highs at 18.65, which is the maximum since April 2017.

Currently, silver is trading 1.20% positive on the day around 18.70.

FX Empire analyst Christopher Lewis expects more buys for the metal, ""with that, I think that the market will continue to look at dips as potential buying opportunities, but I would be a bit cautious about buying up here considering that we are so overbought.""

At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CBS options chain for the new October 11th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.

Because the $40.50 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 58%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.86% return on the cash commitment, or 27.51% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost .

Considering the fact that the $41.50 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 53%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.80% boost of extra return to the investor, or 26.90% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost .

2019-09-03 15:29:08,"Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel  , in trading on Tuesday, shares of Hospitality Properties Trust (Symbol: HPT) were yielding above the 9% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $2.16), with the stock changing hands as low as $23.90 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the iShares Russell 3000 ETF ( IWV  ) back on 5/31/2000 - you would have paid $78.27 per share. Fast forward to 5/31/2012 and each share was worth $77.79 on that date, a loss of $0.48 or 0.6% decrease over twelve years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $10.77 per share in dividends over the same period, increasing your return to 13.15%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.0%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 9% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Hospitality Properties Trust (Symbol: HPT) is a member of the Russell 3000, giving it special status as one of the largest 3000 companies on the U.S. stock markets.      In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Hospitality Properties Trust, looking at the history chart for HPT below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 9% annual yield.   makeArticleAd();   Click here to find out which 9 other dividend   stocks just recently went on sale »

At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ADS options chain for the new October 11th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.

Because the $117.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 59%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.33% return on the cash commitment, or 32.02% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost .

Considering the fact that the $120.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 50%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.27% boost of extra return to the investor, or 31.43% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost .

NEW  YORK, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Tuesday, with U.S. crude futures down 2% after manufacturing data raised concerns about a weakening global economy, while the U.S.-China trade dispute continued to drag on investor sentiment.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude  futures fell $1.16, or 2.1%, to settle at $53.94 a barrel. The session low was $52.84 a barrel, the lowest since Aug. 9.

Prices extended losses following data that showed U.S. manufacturing activity in August contracted for the first time in three years.  Earlier, separate data showed euro zone manufacturing activity contracted for a seventh month in August. 

""That deterioration is continuing to undermine the demand growth outlook for oil,"" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital in New York.

Oil prices have fallen around 20% since a 2019 peak reached in April, hit by concerns the trade war would dent oil demand.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that trade talks between the United States and China were going well, though he warned he would be ""tougher"" in negotiations if discussions drag on until his second term.  Trump said the two sides would meet for talks this month.

Chinese Vice Premier Liu He said China firmly opposes a trade war, the state news agency Xinhua reported. 

Washington began imposing 15% tariffs on an array of Chinese imports on Sunday, while China began placing new duties on U.S. crude oil.

The U.S.-China trade dispute ""is the single most important flat price driver of late,"" said Tamas Varga of oil brokerage PVM.

On the supply side, Venezuela's oil exports fell in August to their lowest level in 2019, internal reports and Refinitiv Eikon data showed, following tougher U.S. sanctions. 

Russian oil production  in August rose to 11.294 million barrels per day (bpd), data showed on Monday, hitting its highest since March and topping the rate Moscow pledged under a pact with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). 

""Downside price pressures were accentuated today by weekend indications that OPEC had lifted production in August on a month-to-month basis for the first time this year while Russia is reportedly producing beyond agreed upon quota,"" Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note.

Data due this week on U.S. inventory levels will be delayed by a day to Wednesday and Thursday because of the U.S. Labor Day holiday on Monday.

Oil prices are likely to remain range-bound for the ""foreseeable future"" and there will be little spending growth in North American oil and gas fields in the near to medium term, Lorenzo Simonelli, chief executive of General Electric Co's Baker Hughes  said.

[Editor's Note: This article is updated each week with the latest insider moves.]

I have learned that a simple, yet effective way to find stocks to buy is to look for companies with insider buying. This is especially the case if the stock has recently moved downwards in price.

Insiders are people who have access to confidential information about a company. When they buy or sell their company's stock, the need to make a public filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This is intended to prevent insiders from taking advantage of information that the public does not have access to. For example, if an insider has information that a news story which will drive the stock price higher is about to be released, they could buy it from shareholders that don't know the news.

Because of this we can find out when insiders are buying or selling their stock.

There are many reasons why they may sell. Maybe they need to raise money to buy a house or to pay for their kids' braces.

However, there is only one reason why an insider will buy the stock. They believe that it is currently undervalued. They buy it because they believe that it will eventually trade higher and they will profit.

The following stocks have had significant insider buying following recent price declines.

Post Holdings (NYSE: POST ) is a consumer packaged goods holding company. POST reported earnings earlier this month, and shareholders did not like what they heard. In just a few days, POST stock lost over 10% of its value.

As president of Michael Foods, an operating company of Post Holdings, Mark Westphal is an insider of the company. He must think that the selloff is an overreaction because he just invested almost $200,000 of his personal funds. He paid $98.13 per share for 2,000 shares .

Wall Street also thinks that POST is a good value at current levels. Twelve firms follow the company on a research basis. Ten of them have ""buy"" ratings on it, while the other two have the stock rated as a ""hold."" The average target price is around $123, which is over 20% higher than where it is currently trading.

J.C. Penney (NYSE: JCP ) sells merchandise to its customers though its department store and website. Like many other traditional retailers, this company is facing tough times. Some analysts attribute this to the  Amazon  (NASDAQ: AMZN ) effect, while others think that it is due to a series of strategic blunders.

Wall Street doesn't see this company turning around any time soon. The average rating is ""underweight,"" and the average target price is 86 cents. This is probably the lowest price target that I have ever seen put on a company.

Many insiders must think the stock is a bargain at these levels because the have just made large purchases. CEO Jill Soltau just bought 500,000 shares at 56 cents per share . Chairman Ron Tysoe made an even larger investment of almost $600,000 when he paid 59 cents for 1 million shares. There has been significant buying by other insiders as well.

Town Sports International Holdings (NASDAQ: CLUB ) offers group exercise and fitness programs. Shareholders of this company may be be losing weight if they work out there, but they are also losing money. The value of CLUB stock has fallen by almost 80% over the past year.

Patrick Walsh is the CEO of CLUB. He must believe that the stock is a great value at these levels. On Aug.26, he invested $330,000 of his personal funds when he paid an average price of $1.52 for 216,266 shares. Just two days later, he bought another 68,550 shares at an average price of $1.87 per share. This puts his investment up to just over $450,000.

Only one firm follows Town Sports on a research basis. It has a ""buy"" rating on it with a target price of $3.

Supernus Pharmaceuticals b( NASDAQ: SUPN ) engages in the development and commercialization of products for the treatment of central nervous system diseases.

When the company announced its second-quarter 2019 results, shareholders were disappointed and the stock dropped from around $33 to $26 a share.

The CEO and president of the company, Jack Khattar, believes this selloff has created a great buying opportunity. He just paid $26.39 a share for 7,300 shares .

The Street also believes the stock is a good value at these levels. Eight firms follow it and the average rating is a ""buy."" The average target price is $53, which is almost two times higher than where SUPN stock is is currently trading.

TriState Capital Holdings (NASDAQ: TSC) is a bank holding company that provides commercial banking, private banking and investment services to middle-market companies, institutions and high net worth individuals.

TSC has lost about 20% of its value over the past three months due to fears over an inverted yield curve and a possible recession.

James Getz is the chairman, CEO and president of TriState. He must believe that the stock will eventually rally because he just bought 25,000 shares for $19.41 per share. Nothing says confidence like an almost $500,000 investment .

Wall Street agrees with Getz. Five firms follow it. The average rating is ""overweight"" while the average target price is $25.50, about 25% higher than current levels.

East West Bancorp (NASDAQ: EWBC ) is a bank holding company that provides financial services. After East West reported its Q2 2019 earnings, the stock dropped by almost 30%.

As a result of this selloff, there has been significant insider buying. These insiders must believe that the earnings release wasn't as bad as the sellers thought.

CFO Irene Oh just purchased 6,400 shares at $39.10, a $250,000 investment. Paul Krause is the executive vice president. He made a similar size investment when he paid $39.19 for 6,400 shares. And CEO Dominic Ng just invested $600,000 on Aug. 27 when he bought 15,800 shares at $38.01. On Aug. 28 and Aug. 29, Ng made investments bought another 10,040 shares.

Community Health Systems (NYSE: CYH ) engages in the management and operation of hospitals.

CYH stock has lost over 50% of its value since this past March. This could be because shareholders are disappointed after the company reported a loss of $1.47 a share in its most recent quarter.

Wayne Smith is the CEO and chairman of Community Health. Has must believe that the selloff is almost done because he just invested over $2 million into the stock at an average price of $1.99.

In early August, Community Health's Executive Vice President and General Counsel Ben Fordham made a $57,000 investment when he paid $2.29 for 25,000 shares. Even more recently, on Aug. 27, Fordham purchased another 25,000 shares at $1.85 per share.

Analysts at Jefferies downgraded shares of Boston Beer to   ""underperform"" on Tuesday, lowering their price target from $360   to $332.

This time around, the company is keeping   its regular quarterly dividend unchanged, but it's paying a   special cash dividend of $0.04 per share. That brings the total   dividend distribution up to $0.10 per share, payable on October   15 to shareholders of record on October 4. The iron ore business is cyclical, with prices hinging on   supply and demand.

2019-09-03 10:50:00,"  Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. ( HLT )  continues to expand its footprint in China. To this end, the company has announced the expansion of Conrad Hotels & Resorts with the opening of Conrad Shenyang in Northeast China.  makeArticleAd();  The hotel is situated at the heart of the historic city that was home to the birth of the Qing Dynasty. Notably, this 315-roomed hotel marks the brand's second property in China within a month. Conrad Shenyang is owned by Hang Lung Properties and managed by Hilton.    The company is confident about the success of this hotel as it offers the city's largest guest rooms with stylish and modern design, advanced dining concepts and uninterrupted views. Qian Jin, area president for Greater China and Mongolia, Hilton, stated that ""We are seeing promising momentum in the revitalization and development of Shenyang's business environment as well as its influence on surrounding areas"".    The hotel is in close proximity to the city's administrative bureaus, high-end retail shops and entertainment venues. Conrad Shenyang is less than three kilometers away from Shenyang North Railway Station and six kilometers from Shenyang Railway Station.   Strategic Expansion to Drive Growth    In a bid to maintain its position as the fastest-growing global hospitality company, Hilton is continuing to drive unit growth. To this end, Hilton opened 123 new hotels during the second quarter of 2019. It also achieved net unit growth of 15,700 rooms, marking roughly 7% increase from the prior-year quarter.    As of Jun 30, 2019, Hilton's development pipeline comprised nearly 2,490 hotels, with roughly 373,000 rooms throughout 109 countries and territories including 37 countries and territories.

Backed by solid expansion strategies and a strong brand presence, shares of Hilton have gained 28.6% year to date compared with the  industry  '  s 16.4% rally.

In the second quarter, RevPAR for worldwide comparable system-wide properties increased 1.4%, driven by a 7% improvement in average daily rate (ADR). The company anticipates its system-wide RevPAR to witness a year-over-year improvement of 1-2% on a comparable and currency-neutral basis.

 Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. ( HLT )  continues to expand its footprint in China. To this end, the company has announced the expansion of Conrad Hotels & Resorts with the opening of Conrad Shenyang in Northeast China.  makeArticleAd();  The hotel is situated at the heart of the historic city that was home to the birth of the Qing Dynasty. Notably, this 315-roomed hotel marks the brand's second property in China within a month. Conrad Shenyang is owned by Hang Lung Properties and managed by Hilton.    The company is confident about the success of this hotel as it offers the city's largest guest rooms with stylish and modern design, advanced dining concepts and uninterrupted views. Qian Jin, area president for Greater China and Mongolia, Hilton, stated that ""We are seeing promising momentum in the revitalization and development of Shenyang's business environment as well as its influence on surrounding areas"".    The hotel is in close proximity to the city's administrative bureaus, high-end retail shops and entertainment venues. Conrad Shenyang is less than three kilometers away from Shenyang North Railway Station and six kilometers from Shenyang Railway Station.   Strategic Expansion to Drive Growth    In a bid to maintain its position as the fastest-growing global hospitality company, Hilton is continuing to drive unit growth. To this end, Hilton opened 123 new hotels during the second quarter of 2019. It also achieved net unit growth of 15,700 rooms, marking roughly 7% increase from the prior-year quarter.    As of Jun 30, 2019, Hilton's development pipeline comprised nearly 2,490 hotels, with roughly 373,000 rooms throughout 109 countries and territories including 37 countries and territories. For 2019, the company anticipates net unit growth of 6.5%.    Backed by solid expansion strategies and a strong brand presence, shares of Hilton have gained 28.6% year to date compared with the  industry  '  s 16.4% rally. Notably, the expansion of Conrad Hotels & Resorts is likely to help Hilton boost its overall revenues and witness increased revenue per available room (RevPAR) for its worldwide comparable system-wide properties.

     In the second quarter, RevPAR for worldwide comparable system-wide properties increased 1.4%, driven by a 7% improvement in average daily rate (ADR). The company anticipates its system-wide RevPAR to witness a year-over-year improvement of 1-2% on a comparable and currency-neutral basis.    Currently, Hilton, which shares space with Hyatt Hotels Corporation H  , Marriott International, Inc. MAR  and Choice Hotels International, Inc. CHH  , carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2019-09-03 15:50:00,"By Jonathan Stempel

Sept 3 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Tuesday rejected efforts by major drugmakers, pharmacies and distributors to dismiss claims that they caused the nation's opioid crisis, clearing the way for a scheduled  landmark trial even as he pushes for a nationwide settlement.

U.S. District Judge Dan Polster, who oversees roughly 2,000 opioid lawsuits by states, counties and cities, said the plaintiffs can try to prove that drugmakers' deceptive marketing of the painkillers caused a harmful, massive increase in supply that pharmacies and distributors did not do enough to stop.

The ruling was among seven decisions and orders totaling 80 pages from Polster ahead of a scheduled Oct. 21 trial by two Ohio counties against Purdue Pharma, the OxyContin maker accused of fueling the epidemic, and several other defendants.

Polster also refused to dismiss civil conspiracy claims against drugmakers, pharmacies and distributors, and said federal law did not preempt much of theplaintiffs' case.

Other defendants included the drugmakers Endo International Plc  and Johnson & Johnson ; pharmacy operators CVS Health Corp , Rite Aid Corp , Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc  and Walmart Inc ; and distributors AmerisourceBergen Corp , Cardinal Health Inc  and McKesson Corp .

Polster also refused to dismiss a variety of claims against generic drugmakers Allergan Plc , Mallinckrodt Plc  and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd .

Opioid addiction claimed roughly 400,000 lives in the United States from 1999 to 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Critics of the industry said opioid makers hid the addiction and abuse risks of prolonged use from consumers.

Rite Aid's lawyers declined to comment. Lawyers for other major defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Paul Hanly, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said his clients were pleased that Polster ""almost uniformly"" agreed with their positions on the dismissal requests and whether to admit various testimony.

J&J has said it will appeal an Oklahoma judge's Aug. 26 order that it pay $572.1 million to that state for the company's role in the opioid epidemic. 

Purdue and its owners, the Sackler family, have been in talks on a possible $10 billion to $12 billion nationwide settlement of opioid claims, two people familiar with the matter said last week. 

That accord could include a bankruptcy filing for the Stamford, Connecticut-based company. Purdue and the Sacklers have denied the allegations.

2019-09-03 10:21:00,"  Nordstrom, Inc. JWN  is losing footing in investors' books, owing to strained gross margin trend. Investor sentiment for the stock was further hurt by the dismal second-quarter fiscal 2019 results, which were impacted by the persistence of soft sales trends in full-price and off-price businesses. Also, higher expenses due to increased fixed costs on lower sales remain an added concern. Consequently, management trimmed the upper end of its earnings per share view.  makeArticleAd();  A glimpse at this stock's price performance reveals that it has underperformed the industry so far in the year. Shares of this Seattle, WA-based company have lost approximately 38%, wider than the industry  's 31.1% decline.    Moreover, unimpressive estimate revision trend for the current and next quarter of fiscal 2019 buoys pessimism. Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has moved down by 5 cents and 8 cents to 67 cents and $1.53, respectively.       Let's Introspect.   Reasons for Nordstrom's Distress    Nordstrom has been witnessing soft gross margin for a while now due to higher expenses. In second-quarter fiscal 2019, gross margin contracted 50 basis points (bps) mainly on account of higher occupancy expenses. Although the company expects gross profit to improve in the near term due to higher sales during the anniversary sale, estimated sales decline in fiscal 2019 might dent gross margin in the long run.    The company's growth strategy focused on enhancement of digital experience and increased investments in supply chain bodes well for the long term. However, investments related to occupancy, technology, supply chain and marketing have resulted in increased near-term costs. In second-quarter fiscal 2019, selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, rose 26 bps, primarily owing higher fixed costs on lower sales.    Notably, management had earlier stated that it expects to incur $35 million as pre-opening costs toward opening women's store in New York this October. All these expenses might weigh on the company's margins and profitability.    Moreover, the company now estimates net sales to decline nearly 2% compared with the prior projection of flat to down 2%. It now envisions adjusted earnings per share of $3.25-$3.50 for fiscal 2019 compared with $3.25-$3.65 projected earlier and $3.55 anticipated in the last fiscal.   Can Efforts Aid Revival?    Nordstrom's store-expansion efforts and customer-based strategy appear encouraging. The company remains keen on prioritizing its investments in the top North American markets. The opening of new stores is not only expected to attract customers but also boost its top line via synergies across other channels. Moreover, it has been progressing well with expansion in Canada by opening six Rack stores in fiscal 2018. Overall, the company envisions $1 billion sales opportunity from its expansion in Canada by 2020, including six planned full-line stores and 15 Rack stores. Furthermore, management remains keen on domestic store expansion.    The company's significant progress on its customer-based strategy places it well to reach the revenue target of $20 billion by 2020. This strategy focuses on three strategic factors - leveraging the company's brand strength, providing excellent services and offering compelling products to its customers.    Nordstrom is focused on advancing in the technology space, by boosting e-commerce and digital networks, and improving its supply-chain channels and marketing efforts. In second-quarter fiscal 2019, digital sales improved 4%, representing about 30% of sales growth. Further, the company is on track to achieve savings at the high end of the company-provided guidance of $150-$200 million.    We expect the aforementioned initiatives to act as tailwinds, injecting some momentum in this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company's performance in the coming months.   3 Stocks to Watch    Zumiez Inc.

2019-09-03 11:31:36,"Investors in Immunomedics, Inc. (Symbol: IMMU) saw new options begin trading today, for the October 11th expiration. At Stock Options Channel  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the IMMU options chain for the new October 11th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.    The put contract at the $11.50 strike price has a current bid of 45 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $11.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $11.05 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of IMMU, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $12.53/share today. Because the $11.50 strike represents an approximate 8% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 70%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.91% return on the cash commitment, or 37.59% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost  .  makeArticleAd();  Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Immunomedics, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $11.50 strike is located relative to that history:       Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $13.50 strike price has a current bid of 45 cents. If an investor was to purchase shares of IMMU stock at the current price level of $12.53/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $13.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 11.33% if the stock gets called away at the October 11th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if IMMU shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Immunomedics, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing IMMU's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $13.50 strike highlighted in red:    Considering the fact that the $13.50 strike represents an approximate 8% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 59%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.59% boost of extra return to the investor, or 34.50% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost  .    The implied volatility in the put contract example is 71%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 76%.    Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $12.53) to be 67%.

MEXICO CITY, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Tuesday the public should have the right to choose whether ex-presidents should face trial once a bill has passed Congress making it easier to hold referendums.

Speaking after an official said an investigation had been opened on a 2014 scandal that battered the reputation of his predecessor, Enrique Pena Nieto, Lopez Obrador said he did not want to pursue former presidents in court.

""And once (the constitution) has been reformed and these referendums can be held, if the people ask for it and want ex-presidents to stand trial, that right is guaranteed,"" Lopez Obrador said at his regular morning news conference.

On Monday, Irma Sandoval, head of the Public Administration Ministry, said the government had filed a criminal complaint against a number of former officials over the case of a luxury house acquired by Pena Nieto's then-wife, Angela Rivera.

In November 2014, it emerged that Rivera was purchasing the house from a government contractor, sparking accusations that Pena Nieto was caught in a conflict of interest.

Pena Nieto was later cleared by a government-led investigation that critics derided as a whitewash, and the episode did lasting damage to his authority.

Sandoval did not identify the ex-officials now under scrutiny, but when asked whether the investigation led toward Pena Nieto, she responded: ""We could say that, yes.""

Lopez Obrador, who took office in December, spent years campaigning against corruption in Mexican politics. But he disappointed supporters when he said he did not want to rake through the past after winning election in July 2018.

Still, in recent weeks, expectations have risen that Lopez Obrador is serious about tackling corruption.

Prosecutors have launched investigations of two top officials from the previous administration for alleged misuse of public funds, Emilio Lozoya, former boss of state oil firm Pemex, and ex-Social Development Minister Rosario Robles.

Both have denied any wrongdoing. Still, a lawyer for Lozoya said that Pena Nieto was aware of his client's actions at Pemex. Pena Nieto has rejected any suggestion of wrongdoing.

Lopez Obrador says Pena Nieto is not under investigation. But he likes to stress that political corruption came from the top down in Mexico, and underlined the point again on Tuesday.

""The juiciest deals done under the aegis of public office got the nod of the presidents,"" he told the news conference.",Mexican president says referendums could decide fate of ex-presidents - Nasdaq.com,https://www.nasdaq.com/article/mexican-president-says-referendums-could-decide-fate-of-expresidents-20190903-00953
2019-09-03 08:29:00,"There's no single factor explaining Warren Buffett's long string of profitable stock investments through the years. In fact, the Oracle of Omaha's strategy has shifted over the decades, in some cases stressing deep value plays and at other times paying premiums for high-performing businesses.

The good news is that Buffett has been outspoken about the key factors he considers when shopping for stocks, including high returns on invested capital, brand strength, and customer loyalty. Yet he doesn't necessarily invest in every single stock that meets those criteria. Below we'll look at a few stocks that investors can buy today that boast one or more of these crucial characteristics.

Image source: Getty Images.

A sure way to lose money investing in stocks is to buy companies that destroy shareholder value, or require increasing amounts of cash simply to compete in their industries. The best businesses, on the other hand, generate lots of excess cash and consistently find ways to invest in high-return initiatives.

Home Depot 's (NYSE: HD) stellar return on invested capital, a favorite Buffett metric, fits squarely in the latter category. It trounces peers like Lowe's (NYSE: LOW) . Yet at over 40%, the efficiency figure is also one of the highest on the entire stock market.

HD Return on Invested Capital (TTM) data by YCharts. TTM = trailing 12 months.

That market-thumping result is partly due to the retailer's steady market-share gains and above-average profitability. Other important factors have been smart investments in building its e-commerce infrastructure in recent years, while upgrading the shopping experience for professional contractors and DIY shoppers, and buying back shares. These moves, and the financial wins that they produced, suggest the management team has the desire -- and ability -- to be good stewards of whatever capital the company generates.

Buffett seeks companies with above-average levels of customer loyalty, since that factor supports steadier growth and strong pricing power. TJX Companies (NYSE: TJX) , the retailer behind the T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, and Home Goods brands, easily meets this standard.

The seller of off-price apparel and home goods has notched higher sales at its network of existing locations in each of the last 23 years, which is a record that traditional retailing peers like Walmart and Target just can't match. Following a strong second-quarter report, highlighted by customer traffic gains across its brands, the chain in mid-August affirmed its prediction of modest growth in both the top and bottom lines this year following a banner 2018.

TJX Companies can build on that positive momentum by using its dominant industry position to secure quality merchandise at deep discounts. Its track record over the last two decades suggests a knack for finding these products, and for marketing them to customers through its flexible store layout. These are a few of the biggest reasons CEO Ernie Herrman and his team believe they can expand their base to as many as 6,000 locations over the long term from the current footprint of 4,400.

McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) has stumbled at times in keeping fans happy over the past few decades. Yet it has always found its way back to market leadership through whatever turn that consumers take in their tastes for fast food. That persistent customer loyalty is a major indicator that Buffett looks for in stocks, and it helps make Mickey D's an attractive investment.

The latest results show that its menu changes, like switching to cage-free eggs and never-frozen beef, are resonating with customers. Its massive capital investment plan, meanwhile, is helping CEO Steve Easterbrook lift sales growth in McDonald's home country closer to the market-thumping pace it enjoys in places like Australia and France.

The best news is that there's room to further improve on its growth rate while still generating the type of profitability that rivals can only dream about. Its operating margin is rising toward the mid-40% range, versus 33% for Yum! Brands  and 8% for Chipotle Mexican Grill . That performance gap would likely jump out to Buffett, and it's a sign that investors who buy the stock today won't be disappointed in their long-term returns.

The bone of contention has been a 3% digital tax on technology firms that French lawmakers have decided to impose from January 2020.  makeArticleAd();  Although France's President Emanuel Macron has aimed to defuse the tensions by reportedly reaching a 'compromise' after his U.S. counterpart threatened to levy retaliatory tariffs on wines, the issue is far from being fully resolved. The stop-gap arrangement on the sidelines of the G7 summit is merely keeping at bay a budding conflict from escalating.     Digital Services Tax    The French digital services tax is applicable to businesses with global revenues of more than €750 million ($845 million) and €25 million ($28 million) in France. The 3% tax will be levied on large technology companies that generate significant revenues from digital businesses, such as by collecting vast amounts of user data and selling targeted digital advertising. The tariffs are broadly based on the recommendations by Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (""OECD"") and seek to address the shortcomings of global taxation policy related to digital businesses.    Time and again, France has raised its voice against low tax payments by large multinational players despite having significant operations in the country. The proposed tax will largely apply to about 30 such companies, the lion's share of which is U.S.-based technology firms.

Peter Hiltz, Amazon's director of international tax policy and planning, perfectly observed, ""The tax has the potential to impede the efforts of U.S. SMBs (small- and medium-sized businesses) to grow and sell into France because it increases their cost of doing business.

",Tech Stocks Hit By France's Digital Tax: Trade War Brewing? - Nasdaq.com,https://www.nasdaq.com/article/tech-stocks-hit-by-frances-digital-tax-trade-war-brewing-cm1206634
2019-09-03 08:15:00," Amid uncertain economic-operating backdrop, investors are apprehensive while taking decisions. Despite continued domestic economic growth, sturdy equity markets and increasing corporate earnings owing to tax reforms, the Fed's accommodative-monetary policy, Brexit-related political and economic concerns, tensions arising from the unsolved U.S.-China trade deal negotiations, the U.S. government shutdown and expectation of a global economic slowdown have hampered economic activities since the beginning of the year.  makeArticleAd();  Nonetheless, given the impressive financial performance in the second quarter, along with a healthy consumer-spending environment, the time is apt for investors to make profitable investment decisions.    Around 95% of the S&P 500 companies, reported so far, exhibited decent results for the June-end quarter. While earnings suggested a lackluster show, the revenue performance displayed a favorable momentum marching ahead. Further, the S&P 500 Index returned merely 4.3% in the quarter, leading investors to venture into the domain of growth stocks.    However, amid several domestic and international happenings, it may be a cliché, so sticking to the old-school style of investing in stocks that provide steady income in the form of regular dividends, along with a solid growth potential, would be wiser. While betting on undervalued stocks could be appropriate in this scenario, one may end up falling in a value trap if the low-price multiples are justified with weak fundamentals.    Therefore, we have selected stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank, indicating that these have been witnessing positive estimate revisions, which generally translate into rapid price appreciation. Following this strategy can help investors reap profits despite the prevalent ambiguity of the situation.    Moreover, regular dividend-paying stocks always attract more investors as these act as a steady source of income. Most of the time, cash dividends return more than what can be earned from deposits in savings accounts.    Hence, while selecting stocks, investors should focus on the dividend yield (annual dividend per share/stock's price per share) together with growth potential, which is reflected by the price rally.   5 S&P Stocks to Bet On    With the help of our Zacks Stock Screener  , we have shortlisted five stocks which carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy), have outperformed the S&P 500, year to date and pay dividend that yields more than 1.50%.    Further, these stocks have a VGM Score  of 'A' or 'B'. Using our new style score system, the VGM Score rates each stock on the combined weighted styles, helping identify the ones with the most attractive value, highest growth, and most promising momentum, across the board. The combination of all three styles that goes into the VGM Score makes it one of the most comprehensive and best performing indicators to use with the Zacks Rank.

Amid uncertain economic-operating backdrop, investors are apprehensive while taking decisions. Despite continued domestic economic growth, sturdy equity markets and increasing corporate earnings owing to tax reforms, the Fed's accommodative-monetary policy, Brexit-related political and economic concerns, tensions arising from the unsolved U.S.-China trade deal negotiations, the U.S. government shutdown and expectation of a global economic slowdown have hampered economic activities since the beginning of the year.  makeArticleAd();  Nonetheless, given the impressive financial performance in the second quarter, along with a healthy consumer-spending environment, the time is apt for investors to make profitable investment decisions.    Around 95% of the S&P 500 companies, reported so far, exhibited decent results for the June-end quarter. While earnings suggested a lackluster show, the revenue performance displayed a favorable momentum marching ahead. Further, the S&P 500 Index returned merely 4.3% in the quarter, leading investors to venture into the domain of growth stocks.    However, amid several domestic and international happenings, it may be a cliché, so sticking to the old-school style of investing in stocks that provide steady income in the form of regular dividends, along with a solid growth potential, would be wiser. While betting on undervalued stocks could be appropriate in this scenario, one may end up falling in a value trap if the low-price multiples are justified with weak fundamentals.    Therefore, we have selected stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank, indicating that these have been witnessing positive estimate revisions, which generally translate into rapid price appreciation. Following this strategy can help investors reap profits despite the prevalent ambiguity of the situation.    Moreover, regular dividend-paying stocks always attract more investors as these act as a steady source of income. Most of the time, cash dividends return more than what can be earned from deposits in savings accounts.    Hence, while selecting stocks, investors should focus on the dividend yield (annual dividend per share/stock's price per share) together with growth potential, which is reflected by the price rally.   5 S&P Stocks to Bet On    With the help of our Zacks Stock Screener  , we have shortlisted five stocks which carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy), have outperformed the S&P 500, year to date and pay dividend that yields more than 1.50%.    Further, these stocks have a VGM Score  of 'A' or 'B'. Using our new style score system, the VGM Score rates each stock on the combined weighted styles, helping identify the ones with the most attractive value, highest growth, and most promising momentum, across the board. The combination of all three styles that goes into the VGM Score makes it one of the most comprehensive and best performing indicators to use with the Zacks Rank.

BUENOS AIRES, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Argentina's peso surged on Tuesday, pumped up by Wall Street traders cheering President Mauricio Macri's capital controls that are aimed at protecting the beleaguered currency.

The peso closed 5.39% higher at 55.98 per U.S. dollar, traders said, its strongest level in a week after a near record low close on Friday. Country risk, which soared to its highest level in more than a decade last month, also fell.

The currency rebound gives some relief to Macri, after a shock primary election battering last month sparked a sharp crash in the country's bonds, equities and the peso, which lost around 26% of its value against the greenback in August alone.

Argentina's S&P Merval stock index , however, took a hit in afternoon trading, closing down 11.9% at a two-year low in a slide that local analysts attributed to global trade jitters.

""All the markets are in the red and a weakened country like Argentina, with a complicated political situation, gets hits even more,"" said Hector Scasserra, director of local brokerage firm Arpenta Sociedad de Bolsa.

In Europe, the pounding of Argentina's bonds also eased after they had fallen to record lows on Monday, while there were tentative gains in some foreign-traded bank shares.

Ratings agency Fitch upgraded Argentina's long-term issuer debt rating to ""CC"" or just barely above default from ""restricted default"" saying the new rating reflects their view that ""a further default or debt restructuring of some kind is probable."" 

Frankfurt-listed American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) of Grupo Financiero Galicia  were up 0.6% after having tumbled 7.7.% on Monday while Banco Macro SA's  ADRs fell over 6% in New York, where markets were closed on Monday for a holiday.

MarketAxess data showed Argentina's century bond  traded marginally higher while the January 2028 bond  dipped under 37 cents on the dollar.

The black market peso, available via unofficial traders, also rose on Tuesday, although not as sharply as the official spot rate. Following a fall on Monday, it has now diverged from the official rate by the largest margin since 2015, a sign of tension over pricing of the currency. 

STILL AN EMERGING MARKET

Index provider MSCI said it was closely monitoring developments in Argentina but that the country's ""emerging market"" status for the purpose of MSCI indexes remained valid for now as MSCI Argentina only held foreign-listed shares.

Argentina was included in the emerging markets index in May, potentially boosting inflows to the eight stocks that were added. 

Any reclassification of Argentina in the widely followed indexes would first require a public consultation from MSCI.

On Sunday, the government authorized the central bank to restrict purchases of dollars as it burns through its reserves to prop up the peso. The currency controls were a 180-degree turn for Macri, a free-markets advocate who abolished capital controls after he came to power in 2015. 

It was the government's latest attempt to stabilize the peso, which has lost around 20% of its value since opposition presidential candidate Alberto Fernandez emerged as the clear front-runner in the Aug. 11 primary election.

On Tuesday, the government also said in a decree published in the country's official gazette that it would unilaterally hike the minimum wage by 35% over the next few months. Argentina's 12-month inflation is running at close to 55%.

Fernandez and his running mate, former President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, are considered a riskier prospect by investors, who fear Argentina could return to the interventionist policies of her former government.

On Monday, central bank president Guido Sandleris called Argentina's financial system ""strong"" and said the bank would adhere to its strict monetary policy, despite the currency restrictions. 

Sandleris, speaking at a news conference, said the bank was in talks with the International Monetary Fund to ""redefine"" the monetary goals for September under its $57 billion financing agreement.",Wall Street traders pump up Argentine peso as currency controls kick in - Nasdaq.com,https://www.nasdaq.com/article/wall-street-traders-pump-up-argentine-peso-as-currency-controls-kick-in-20190903-00951
2019-09-03 11:57:10,"The DividendRank  formula at Dividend Channel  ranks a coverage universe of thousands of  dividend stocks  , according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics - strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive. International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. (Symbol: IFF) presently has an above average rank, in the top 50% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most ""interesting"" ideas that merit further research by investors.    But making International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. an even more interesting and timely stock to look at, is the fact that in trading on Tuesday, shares of IFF entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $108.52 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30. In the case of International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., the RSI reading has hit 29.7 - by comparison, the universe of dividend stocks covered by Dividend Channel  currently has an average RSI of 46.5. A falling stock price - all else being equal - creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield. Indeed, IFF's recent annualized dividend of 3/share (currently paid in quarterly installments) works out to an annual yield of 2.73% based upon the recent $109.75 share price.    A bullish investor could look at IFF's 29.7 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. Among the fundamental datapoints dividend investors should investigate to decide if they are bullish on IFF is its dividend history. In general, dividends are not always predictable; but, looking at the history chart below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.  makeArticleAd();        Click here to find out what 9 other oversold   dividend stocks you need to know about »

Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) is nothing if not an enigma. Like its sometime   rival   Amazon    , the company has conquered one sector after another throughout   its lifespan, often working in secrecy for years before   announcing a world-changing technological innovation. With the   release of its new state-of-the-art Apple Card, many investors,   commentators, and fans are looking back on the impact the iPhone   maker has had on one industry in particular: the highly lucrative   payments space. Apple's involvement in the world of payments formally began in   2014, but the company had been preparing for its big debut for   years beforehand. After acquiring a number of start-ups and   filing patents related to payments, Apple took a leap in 2013 by   joining forces with three of the biggest names in the industry:   Visa    (NYSE: V) ,   MasterCard    (NYSE: MA) , and   American Express    (NYSE: AXP) . All three companies had been independently looking   at replacing the traditional information-sharing transaction   system with single-use digital ""tokens."" Apple, with its   enormous brand power    , as well as its unmatched presence in hardware and software,   proved to be the perfect unifying force.makeArticleAd();   Image source: Unsplash.  Even more impressively, the tech giant went on that summer to   approach some of the biggest banks in the U.S. to help bring the   venture to fruition. The negotiations were highly secretive: One   major client,   JPMorgan Chase    (NYSE: JPM) , set up a bunker-like ""war room"" in its headquarters   where 300 people worked tirelessly on the project, of whom only   about a third knew the partner was Apple. The result of all of this, Apple Pay, was unveiled by CEO Tim   Cook in September 2014. At the company's iPhone 6 event, Cook   described the traditional card payment process as outdated and   insecure, relying as it did on a ""vulnerable magnetic interface""   that made loss and theft far too easy. Apple's alternative   allowed customers to pay directly with their devices through   Apple Wallet, a corresponding mobile app. The initiative gained   worldwide attention, and within a few years, the likes of   Starbucks    , KFC, and   J.C. Penney     had all begun accepting Apple Pay. But Cook's ambitions didn't end there. As Apple Pay began   spreading throughout markets across the globe, the company ramped   up its focus on security. The move to ""tokenization"" that had   started with the Visa and Mastercard collaborations has been   developed and perfected over the years to produce an   unprecedentedly secure form of payment. Simply put, a ""token""   refers to the substitution of sensitive information, such as   one's banking details, with nonsensitive data. Apple's brilliant   innovation was creating a single-use credit card number that   could safely verify a transaction while at the same time, owing   to its ephemerality, proving to be all but useless to   criminals. A key motivation for Apple's investment in payments -- as well   as in health, gaming, news, and streaming -- can be found in a   companywide directional shift. Last year's fourth-quarter   earnings report revealed that the company had seen its first   decline in profits and revenue for over a decade. A slowdown in   iPhone sales, as well as a spate of antitrust complaints and   investigations, caused widespread concern that the brand's glory   days were over. In March of this year, however, Apple confirmed   rumors when it officially announced that it   would intensify its push into services    . To phrase it simplistically, the company was saying that from   now on it would focus less on selling gadgets and   more on amassing subscribers    . The release this month of the Apple Card is one of many steps   in this direction. It also adds a new layer of security to   digital transactions, and -- thanks to the product's elegant   platinum design that recalls premium cards issued by banks --   brings the six-year payment venture full-circle, at least in   design terms. The extra security comes from the ease with which   an Apple customer can cancel a card if he or she encounters a   problem. Old-fashioned cardholders will know the pain of losing   their primary source of payment, the frustration of calling their   bank to report the loss, and the worrisome wait to have a   replacement sent to them. The Apple Card eliminates these   concerns. Since an Apple credit card number is essentially   virtual, a user can revoke a corrupted card within seconds   through the app and have a new number issued immediately. It has   been well-received so far, with one commentator calling it   ""insanely great."" Apple is well-positioned to gain a serious market share in the   space. The company revealed recently that there are 1.4 billion   active Apple devices in circulation. in terms of user base, this   places Apple between the twin payment giants, Visa (with 3.3   billion cards in circulation) and Mastercard (875 million). While the card represents a major step forward for Apple Pay,   the company is still encouraging customers to use their devices   as their primary form of payment. For one thing, the card is   expensive to manufacture, and for another, it can be quite easily   damaged. The company was teased on social media for warning   physical cardholders that they'll need to take special care with   the product, including keeping it from ""hard surfaces or   materials"" and ""potentially abrasive objects."" In order to ensure   that the card is used minimally (and that Apple devices are used   more commonly), Apple is offering customers a superior cashback   incentive for paying with a device. Tim Cook turned heads back in January when he announced that   Apple's ""greatest contribution to mankind"" would take place not   in mobile technology   but in the realm of healthcare    .

2019-09-03 08:21:00,"LONDON/BUENOS AIRES, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Investors are bracing to see how Argentine assets fare on Tuesday as U.S. markets reopen after a holiday weekend and Latin America's third largest economy marks its second day under new currency controls.

The pounding of Argentina's bonds eased in Europe after they fell to record lows on Monday and there were tentative gains in some foreign-traded bank shares, as investors waited for Wall Street's first reaction to Buenos Aires' imposition of capital controls over the weekend.

Frankfurt-listed American Depositary Receipts (ADR) of Grupo Financiero Galicia  were up almost 1%, having tumbled 9.15% on Monday, but Banco Macro SA's ADRs slipped again. Brokers were quoting marginally higher prices for Argentina's badly mauled sovereign debt in Europe.

The peso closed 0.88% stronger in official markets on Monday, but ended 0.79% weaker in the black market at 63.5 per dollar, a divergence underscoring mistrust of the official price.

On Sunday, the government authorized the central bank to restrict purchases of dollars as it burns through its reserves to prop up the peso. The currency controls were a 180-degree turn for President Mauricio Macri, a free-markets advocate who abolished capital controls after he came to power in 2015.

KRYNICA ZDROJ, Poland, Sept 3 (Reuters) - BP  may be interested if any of Polish oil refiner PKN Orlen's  assets come up for sale as a result of PKN's planned takeover of rival Lotos , BP's Europe chief said.

European Union antitrust regulators said last month that PKN's bid for Lotos may reduce competition in Poland and neighbouring countries and push up prices. 

""If the EC (European Commission) decides that the market structure needs opening up a bit after the merger, then of course we and other companies would be happy to enter into any discussion about assets that potentially could be for sale,"" BP head of Europe Peter Mather told Reuters on Tuesday.

""That could be anything across the whole value chain,"" he said in an interview on the sidelines of an economic conference in southern Poland.

State-run PKN, which has a market capitalisation of 39.01 billion zlotys ($9.9 billion) said last year that it planned to buy at least a 53% stake in Lotos, which is valued at 16.14 billion zlotys, from the government.

It has formally requested approval from EU regulators for the deal to go ahead. Sources familiar with the situation in Brussels and Warsaw have said that due to competition concerns PKN will likely face long and difficult talks with the European Commission.

BP has already raised its concerns that the merger might harm competition in Poland.

""The concentration issue is now in the hands of the European Commision, we hope that they will take into account our opinion,"" Mather said.

2019-09-03 11:40:44,"Investors in Groupon Inc (Symbol: GRPN) saw new options begin trading today, for the October 11th expiration. At Stock Options Channel  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the GRPN options chain for the new October 11th contracts and identified the following call contract of particular interest.    The call contract at the $2.50 strike price has a current bid of 9 cents. If an investor was to purchase shares of GRPN stock at the current price level of $2.41/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $2.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 7.47% if the stock gets called away at the October 11th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if GRPN shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Groupon Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing GRPN's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $2.50 strike highlighted in red:    Considering the fact that the $2.50 strike represents an approximate 4% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 57%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.73% boost of extra return to the investor, or 35.87% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost  .makeArticleAd();    The implied volatility in the call contract example above is 70%.    Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $2.41) to be 43%.

Sept 3 (Reuters) - Dubai's stock market reversed course to end lower on Tuesday, hurt by its property shares, while blue-chip lenders helped Qatar outperform major markets in the region.

In Dubai, the index  fell 0.5%, with all its real estate stocks tumbling. Emaar Properties , the emirate's largest listed developer, lost 2.3%, while its units Emaar Malls  and Emaar Development  were both 2.1% and 2.2% respectively.

On Monday, Dubai set up a real estate planning commission to regulate projects and avoid competition between semi-government and private firms, in a move designed to address the property market slump. 

However, Emirates NBD  gained a further 2.7%, extending gains for a second day in a row. On Monday, the lender soared 14.9%, reaching its highest level since October 2007, after the bank said that it had raised its foreign ownership limit to 20% from 5% with immediate effect.

The Qatari index  added 0.3%, stretching gains for the fourth straight session, with Qatar International Islamic Bank  surging 5.3% and Qatar National Bank , the Gulf's largest lender by assets, closing 1.1% higher.

The Saudi index  slipped 0.6%, driven down by a 1% fall in Al Rajhi Bank , and a 2.4% drop in Riyad Bank .

The index took a breather on Monday as it has been sliding since Wednesday mainly pressured by its lenders.

Investment bank EFG Hermes had said on Wednesday that the investment case for Saudi banks is no longer ""compelling"" against a backdrop of receding passive fund flows and the emergence of credit quality concerns among others.

Egypt's blue-chip index  declined 0.7%, snapping a four-day winning streak, with most of its blue-chip shares tumbling. Commercial International Bank  was down 0.9% and Eastern Company  traded 3.5% lower.

Non-Arab foreigners were net buyers of stocks during the session and Egyptians and Arabs were net sellers, according to the stock exchange.

DUBAI/WASHINGTON, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Iran on Wednesday said it would take another step away from a 2015 nuclear deal by starting to develop centrifuges to speed up its uranium enrichment but it also gave European powers two more months to try to save the multilateral pact.

Separately, the United States refused to ease its economic sanctions on Iran, imposed fresh ones designed to choke off the smuggling of Iranian oil and rebuffed, but did not rule out, a French plan to give Tehran a $15 billion credit line.

The friction has intensified since U.S. President Donald Trump last year withdrew from the 2015 international accord under which Iran had agreed to rein in its atomic program in exchange for relief from economic sanctions.

Washington has since renewed and intensified its sanctions, slashing Iran's crude oil sales by more than 80%.

Trump again said he was open to the possibility of meeting Iranian President Hassan Rouhani but made clear he had no intention of easing sanctions. 

""That's not happening,"" he said. ""That won't be happening.""

In a televised address, Rouhani said Iran from Friday will begin developing centrifuges to speed up the enrichment of uranium, which can produce fuel for power plants or for atomic bombs, as the next step in reducing its nuclear commitments. 

Under the accord, Iran was allowed to keep restricted quantities of first-generation centrifuges at two nuclear plants. The successful development of more advanced centrifuges would enable it to produce material for a potential nuclear bomb several times faster.

""From Friday, we will witness research and development on different kinds of centrifuges and new centrifuges and also whatever is needed for enriching uranium in an accelerated way,"" Rouhani said. ""All limitations on our Research and Development will be lifted on Friday.""

Iran says it is only enriching uranium to fuel nuclear power plants, but the United States has long suspected the program ultimately aims to produce weapons.

Since Washington's withdrawal from the pact Tehran has made two other moves in violation of the deal, although Iran says it still aims to save the agreement.

Rouhani had threatened to take further measures by Sept. 5 unless France and the other European signatories of the pact did more to protect Iran from the impact of the U.S. penalties, which have drastically reduced Iran's foreign oil sales.

""It is unlikely that we will reach a result with Europe by today or tomorrow ... Europe will have another two months to fulfil its commitments,"" Rouhani said, according to state TV.

But Rouhani also said Iran's new measures will be ""peaceful, under surveillance of the U.N. nuclear watchdog and reversible"" if European powers keep their promises.

Iranian officials, meanwhile, appeared to give a guarded welcome to a French proposal to save the pact by offering Iran about $15 billion in credit lines until the end of the year if Tehran returned to full compliance. 

The United States was cool to the idea but did not categorically reject it.

""We did sanctions today. There will be more sanctions coming. We can't make it any more clear that we are committed to this campaign of maximum pressure and we are not looking to grant any exceptions or waivers,"" Brian Hook, the U.S. special representative for Iran, told reporters.

Washington on Wednesday blacklisted what it called an ""oil for terror"" network of firms, ships and people it suspects are  directed by Iran'sIslamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) with supplying Syria with oil worth hundreds of millions of dollars. 

The United States also issued a new international shipping advisory about IRGC's use of ""deceptive practices"" to violate U.S. sanctions and warned those who do business with blacklisted entities that they may suffer U.S. sanctions.

Washington also offered a reward of up to $15 million for information that disrupts the IRGC's financial operations and its elite paramilitary and espionage arm, the Quds Force.

The steps intensified the U.S. campaign to eliminate Iran's oil exports as a way to pressure it to restrict its nuclear and missile programs as well as its support for regional proxies.

In a possible olive branch to the West, Sweden said Iran had released seven of the 23 crew members of the British-flagged tanker Stena Impero that was seized earlier this summer.

The IRGC detained the Swedish-owned Stena Impero on July 19 in the Strait of Hormuz waterway for alleged marine violations, two weeks after Britain detained an Iranian tanker off the territory of Gibraltar. That vessel was released in August.",Iran to develop centrifuges for faster uranium enrichment - Nasdaq.com,https://www.nasdaq.com/article/iran-to-develop-centrifuges-for-faster-uranium-enrichment-20190904-01133

Contemporary Amperex Technology Co , one of China's leading electric-vehicle battery makers, bought the stake through a A$55 million placement while an additional A$36.5 million was raised through an institutional placement.

The fund-raising comes a few days after the miner took a stake in its flagship Pilgangoora lithium project in Western Australia off the market for lack of an appealing offer. 

Pilbara said a Share Purchase Plan will also be offered to raise up to an additional A$20 million.

Last week, the Western Australian miner cut its sales forecast and curbed spending plans amid a downturn in the market for the battery raw material.

Xinhua did not provide further details about the package, including itswould-be recipients. The agency said the items, which it described as ""controlled knives"", had been temporarily detained.

""The shipment in question was handled correctly via standard security protocol,"" FedEx said in a statement.

The Xinhua report was the latest in a series of allegations against the U.S. package delivery company by Chinese media and law enforcement, and comes amid tense relations between Washington and Beijing.

Xinhua reported in July that Chinese authorities investigating FedEx suspect the company illegally held back more than 100 Huawei Technologies Co Ltd  packages.

The United States in May placed the Chinese telecoms group on a blacklist that effectively blocks U.S. companies from doing business with it.

Police in southeast China'sFujian province launched an investigation last month after a FedEx parcel sent from the United States was found to contain a handgun.

The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS ) has lost a little magic this past month after its earnings report for the third-quarter fiscal year 2019 was a major flop. On August 6, the company announced earnings per share of $1.35 that fell far below the expected $1.75 - a 22.9% earnings miss. It was also a 27.8% year-over-year decline from the $1.87 per share earned a year ago.

In addition, sales of $20.25 billion missed expectations for $21.47 billion in sales. Although this was a 32.9% year-over-year increase from $15.22 billion, the company still reported a 5.7% sales miss.

Looking forward, sales are forecasted to rise 35.5%, while the company's earnings are forecasted to decline 33.8%. In addition, analysts have lowered their estimates 26.9% in the past month. So, it does not look good for DIS.

Company management placed the blame squarely on the acquisition of Fox Entertainment, which it bought for a whopping $71 billion back in March. This buyout was to help DIS launch its Disney+ service and put the company in better position to take on  Netflix ' s (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) streaming services. (More on that in a moment.)

The stock fell 5% post-earnings, and while it has bounced back by about 2%, it's failed to regain any significant momentum. Shares continue to trade well below their 52-week high of $147.15.

Not surprisingly, the weak earnings and sales earn Disney a D-rating for its Fundamental Grade in the  Portfolio Grader . You can see its report card below.

Interestingly, the stock still earns an A for its Quantitative Grade, as buying pressure remains strong. This is also why its Total Grade is a B. In my experience, buying pressure is the single most important variable when determining a stock's health (even more so than the fundamentals).

However, I expect that buying pressure to start drying up soon and lower its Total Grade. Here's why …

For one, the company has a big ESPN and Fox problem. NFL ratings remain low, and that hurts ESPN, which hurts Disney. And we're already seeing the impact the Fox Entertainment acquisition is having, given that company management blamed it for the weak results!

While ""Avengers: Endgame"" made almost $3 billion in global sales in 13 weeks, ""Dark Phoenix"" only made $65 million in sales domestically and $186 million in sales internationally, which isn't much considering the film's $200 million budget.

Disney CFO Christine McCarthy stated that the ""film studio had an operating loss in the third quarter of about $170 million, which was driven by the underperformance of theatrical titles including 'Dark Phoenix,' marketing for future releases and development expenses.""

Now, if DIS has a great holiday movie season, it could soar; but I doubt it. Rather than creating new plot lines, they've been making remake after remake. Why watch a ""new"" remake when you can go to Netflix or Amazon for an original one instead?

Disney's mixed report card is a perfect example of why it's so important to find companies with a strong Quantitative Grade  and  Fundamental Grade. This way, the stock will also have the fundamental support it needs to meander higher over the long term.

While DIS doesn't fit the bill, my  Growth Investor  stocks sure do. All are highly rated, with strong sales and earnings momentum to drive them higher over time. These  Growth Investor  stocks are characterized by 16.7% annual sales growth and 65.6% annual earnings growth, as they did exceptionally well this earnings season.

Out of the 61  Growth Investor  companies that reported so far, 54 stocks reported positive earnings surprises, four were in-line with estimates and only three missed earnings expectations.  DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ: DXCM ) reported a stunning 700% earnings surprise and has since hit several new 52-week highs, including a new 52-week high of $178.45 yesterday. That's after hitting a 52-week high on Tuesday and  one last Friday while the rest of the stock market was selling off!

Clearly, we're investing in the crème de la crème of stocks, which are poised to do well over the long term. In fact, more than  half  of my  Growth Investor stocks are profitable, which include five sitting pretty on triple-digit returns and 34 on double-digit returns. Given how volatile the market has been this August, that's pretty impressive, if you ask me!

This is why I call them  my Bulletproof stocks . They might not get as much hype as DIS is enjoying with its Disney+ launch. But they  are  poised to zig when the market zags and make good money for investors, no matter the current stock market environment.

If you missed out on my previous Bulletproof stock recommendations , that's okay. On August 30, I  added three Bulletproof stocks in my  Growth Investor  August Monthly Issue . You can sign up here to see them.  I'm also going to share  my latest Top 5 Stocks  and what I see ahead in September.

During volatile market conditions, the best defense is a good offense. So if you have new money to put to work,  I encourage you to check out my recommendations here .

2019-09-03 11:32:30,"Investors in   TD Ameritrade  Holding Corporation (Symbol: AMTD) saw new options become available today, for the October 11th expiration. At Stock Options Channel  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AMTD options chain for the new October 11th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.    The put contract at the $43.50 strike price has a current bid of $1.30. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $43.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $42.20 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AMTD, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $43.75/share today. Because the $43.50 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 54%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.99% return on the cash commitment, or 28.71% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost  .  makeArticleAd();  Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $43.50 strike is located relative to that history:       Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $44.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.45. If an investor was to purchase shares of AMTD stock at the current price level of $43.75/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $44.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 3.89% if the stock gets called away at the October 11th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if AMTD shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing AMTD's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $44.00 strike highlighted in red:    Considering the fact that the $44.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 51%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.31% boost of extra return to the investor, or 31.83% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost  .    The implied volatility in the put contract example, as well as the call contract example, are both approximately 29%.    Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $43.75) to be 26%.

Kangping Chen -- Chief Executive Officer and Director

[Foreign Speech] Thank you, Ripple. Good morning, and good evening to everyone, and thank you for joining us today. [Foreign Speech] We continued our strong start to the year with a robust quarter growth. Module shipments during the second quarter were 3,386 megawatt, an increase of 12% sequentially and 21% year-over-year. As with last quarter, overseas shipments accounted for over 90% of total shipments. Total revenues came in $1 billion, an increase of 19% sequentially and 14% year-over-year. While gross margins roughly flat sequentially at 16.5% and up substantially from 12% during the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP net income surged to $29.6 million, a significant increase from $5 million last quarter and $16.1 million during the same period last year. With our mono wafer production capacity growing and optimization of cost structure, we are confident in the overall profitability of the second half of the year.

[Foreign Speech] Demand for overseas markets were strong during the first half of 2019 where total export volumes and the value of modules from China jumped significantly year-over-year. China is expected to drive global demand following the July announcement of the National Development and Reform Commission and the National Energy Administration of a list of approved solar projects that secured government subsidies for 2019. This was a follow-up to their May announcement of the first batch of wind power and the PV grid parity project. China is expected to install 40 gigawatt this year. Bids for UHV supported PV projects have already begun as the domestic market regains growth momentum.

We are rapidly approaching grid parity with the better results for projects such as Dalat [Phonetic] Top Runner project in Neihuang province, coming in on power with local traditional energy. Based on this, we expected China's demand will continue to grow steadily in 2020.

[Foreign Speech] 2019 is a milestone for the global solar industry as grid parity rapidly approaches. A number of emerging overseas markets are quickly reaching gigawatt levels as the market increasingly diversifies away from traditional mature markets. The costs of PV power continues to decline, resulting in lower bidding prices, which are increasingly becoming more competitive with thermal power generation, driven by technological innovation. We expected a proportion of PV grid parity project to increase over the next few years. We are optimistic that global demand will remain strong and is sustainable over the long term.

[Foreign Speech] I will let Gener give you more color on the market later. [Foreign Speech] We significantly increased our investment in expanding our high efficiency mono production capacity during this quarter. This is mainly being driven by our production facility in Leshan, which begun phase 1 production at the end of June and is expected to reach full capacity in the fourth quarter and will expand our total mono wafer capacity to 11.5 gigawatt. Preparations for the 5 gigawatt phase 2 capacity expansion in Leshan were currently under way. The rapid growing of mono wafer production capacity can significantly increase the proportion of overall in-house integrated capacity and improve gross margin.

[Foreign Speech] Our in-house high efficiency annual silicon wafer solar cell and solar module production capacity has reached 10.5 gigawatt, 7.4 gigawatt, and 12.6 gigawatt, respectively by the end of the second quarter of 2019, which include 6.5 gigawatt of mono wafer capacity and 5.8 gigawatt of PERC cell capacity. By the end of 2019, we expect our in-house annual silicon wafer, solar cell and solar module production capacity to reach 15 gigawatt, 10.5 gigawatt, and 16 gigawatt respectively, which includes 11.5 gigawatt of mono capacity, 9.7 gigawatt of PERC cell capacity and 500 megawatt of N-type cell capacity.

[Foreign Speech] We believe that the only way forward is to continue investing in the technical development and optimization -- optimizing the cost structure. Our expanded capacity provides us with a significant competitive advantage when it comes to the performance of our equipment, automation, levels and extendable thermal fields which perform well in product qualified rate and oxygen content index in the industry, while the latest sale improvements has been on the highly efficient N-type cells with 800 megawatt capacity and Hydride Oxide Thin Film technology. For modules, our latest innovative product in the Swan bifacial module with a DuPont Tedlar-based backsheet. The new lightweight bifacial technology has huge potential to go mainstream, because it was not -- not only alleviate installation problems and lowest cost per kilowatt of electricity generated. But also improve the efficiency of the modules and overall power generation, especially for PV power plants.

[Foreign Speech] To conclude, I'm very pleased with the significant progress we have made during the quarter in strengthening our competitive advantages, improving the efficiency of our products and driving costs lower through innovation, especially at a time when the industry is racing toward great parity as one of the largest and the most innovative solar module manufacturers in the world. We are committed to serving our clients with the highest quality products on the market. We will continue to listen to the needs of our clients and grow our market share in the domestic and overseas markets. With our global distribution network and the support teams working closely together, we will continue to drive growth in the area of grid parity.

[Foreign Speech] Before turning the call over to Gener, I will quickly go over our guidance. Based on current estimates, for the third quarter of 2019, the Company estimates total solar module shipments to be in the range of 3.2 gigawatt to 3.5 gigawatt. Total revenue for the third quarter is expected to be in the range of $980 million to $1,070 million. Gross margin for the third quarter is expected to be between 19% to 20%. For the full year of 2019, the Company estimates total solar module shipments to be in the range of 14 gigawatt to 15 gigawatt.

[Foreign Speech] Thank you, Ripple. With that, I would turn it over to Gener.

Gener Miao -- Chief Marketing Officer

Thank you, Mr. Chen. Total shipments in the second quarter were 3,386 megawatt, an increase of 21.2% from the same period last year and exceeding our previous guidance. The increase was driven non-China demand, which remained strong during the quarter. In particular, mono PERC products as a percentage of total shipments continue to grow steadily, and I expect it to reach 70% for the full year of 2019.

In terms of geographic mix, overseas shipments accounted for over 90% of our order book this quarter. With China's latest subsidy policy announcement in July, the Chinese market is expected to regain considerable installation demand starting in late third quarter. The Chinese government's July release -- July release of a list of approved solar projects that secured government subsidy for 2019 has helped to kick-start bids for a number of projects that are expected to simultaneously drive domestic demand and grow in our shipments in China, starting in September.

China is expected to install around 40 gigawatts this year. We also expect that the Chinese market to retain its robust performance well into 2022 due as a number of cross-year projects and the competitiveness of photovoltaic power generation price. The US market remains very strong. Prices have risen in the past quarter, which has resulted in our modules almost selling out.

In addition, our order book for 2020 is rapidly filling up. We have already received the massive inquiries for 2020 and 2021 deliveries from US market. Furthermore, Section 201 tariff exemptions on bifacial solar modules has created a lot of discussions in the market. Based on the current policy, we expect that demand in the US market will start to shift toward bifacial modules steadily where utility sector will be penetrated first.

Turning to Asia Pacific market. In reaction to the cost of the curve [Phonetic], large installations across Japan's largest -- large scale power plants are expected to continue until late 2020. In Vietnam, although some projects in Ninh Thuan province have been postponed, we expect the Ministry of Industry and Trade of Vietnam to release a new distributed subsidy policy version. After such announcements, industrial and commercial distribution will rapidly increase in the Vietnamese market.

In Australia, residential subsidies of Victoria state are being kept in place, which helped to revive the market, driving further growth in the next two years for all residential, commercial and industrial projects. Over in India, the recent PV targets came in larger than expected. The government has indicated that it will provide assistance for larger scale PV grid connected projects, while utility companies are also issuing tenders for all global developers and its investors.

With the cancellation of MIP across European markets PV power generation costs will continue to decline. With the percentage of a grid parity projects continuing to grow, European PV capacity is increasing and expected to drive demand in the market such as France, Germany, Spain and Greece during the second half of this year.

Portugal's [Phonetic] recent PV bids have seen the lowest pricing in Europe, and in order to achieve its renewable energy targets and keep pace with EU energy conservation and the emission targets, PV bidding will continue for the rest of this year. With more and more traditional power stations being decommissioned each year, the importance of solar energy is expected to rise in Europe with the benefits of long-term cost advantages. We are very optimistic about the future growth potential of European markets.

For key emerging markets. The private PPA and the commercial projects are driving the growth, especially in Mexico and Chile. Brazil is expected to continue promoting solar tenders, always medium and the long term. Argentina recently released a new subsidy policy, which is expected to drive medium term installation demand in Latin America. In Middle East, PV biddings have been in full swing this year, with all of our hard demand growing strongly. Saudi Arabian market will soon be upgraded to gigawatt level, while Oman has released the next four large scale PV biddings planned for 2020.

We are the market leader in terms of market share in number of these countries. And we'll continue to invest the resources to explore more long-term growth and the cooperation opportunities. In general, as grid parity becomes a reality. Demand will increasingly become sustainable globally and will be less susceptible to fluctuations caused by policy changes. Therefore, we expect the total global installation demand to continue growing in the future.

ASPs overall increased slightly compared to the last quarter. We also expect average annual prices to remain healthy. We will continue to drive technology innovation to meet market demand with reliable high quality products. Our products were sold over 100 countries globally and we remain the largest solar module supplier in the world. Over the years, we continue to be rejuvenated for our leading technology and reliable high quality products by respected third-party [Phonetic] institutions and industry groups.

After an extensive analysis on the global solar PV market, we were awarded the Frost & Sullivan 2019 Global Solar PV Technology Leadership Award. Our dedicated efforts to improve our high quality products were also recognized by PV tech and the solar media who selected include JinkoSolar as a leading supplier to achieve a AA bankability rating. JinkoSolar is the only PV module supplier to have AA ratings for the past five consecutive quarters. This year JinkoSolar continue to move up the rankings as we hit new milestones, ranking 150th among the top 500 Chinese private enterprises in 2019 up from 279 last year.

As a key opinion leader in the industry, we were much wondered to be the only privately owned corporate thought leader from the renewable energy sector invited to participate in the 2019 Summer Davos Forum on energy panel titled China's Energy Outlook. During the second quarter we attended 12 trade shows and participated in 40 street conferences worldwide. We also hosted 16 customer events and 54 co-marketing activities with key partners across the globe. Our marketing efforts continue to enhance JinkoSolar's brand awareness and reputation in the global PV industry.

With that, I will pass over to Charlie.

Charlie Cao -- Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Gener. Q2 overall results meet our expectations. We have achieved better-than-expected shipments on gross margin. Our improved profitability resulted from lower production costs, slightly higher ASPs and the net foreign exchange gain. Total solar module shipments hit 3.4 gigawatts, up 12% sequentially, and total revenue was $1 billion, up 19% sequentially. The solar market continued its strong momentum and we are on the track to achieve our full year shipment guidance.

Total gross margin was stable at 16.5%, compared to 16.6% in Q1. Our investment on the mono based high-efficient capacity is expected to generate higher gross margins in the second half year. Starting from this quarter, we began to provide additional guidance including quarterly revenue and the gross margin range. With our view on future performance, we believe this will provide a more transparent and comprehensive picture of our operations and future growth expectations.

For the third quarter, we estimate total revenue to be in the range of $980 million to $1.07 billion, and gross margin in the range of 18% to 20%. Total operating expenses accounted for 12.8% of total revenue compared to 12.5% in Q1. The percentage is relatively higher given our high shipping costs -- relatively higher shipping costs from oversea markets. We benefited from RMB depreciating against the US dollar in the second quarter. Net foreign exchange gain was $7 million compared to our net foreign exchange loss of $9 million in Q1. EBITDA was $66 million compared to $49 million in Q1. Non-GAAP net income was $29.6 million. This translates into non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS of $0.72 -- $0.71.

Moving to the balance sheet. At the end of Q2, we increased our balance of cash, cash equivalents to $543 million compared to $486 million at the end of Q1. The restricted cash balance was $158 million at the end of Q2, compared to $164 million at the end of Q1. We continue to improve our operating efficiency, accounts receivable was $809 million, down from $872 million at the end of Q1.

AR turnover days improved to 76 days in Q2, compared to 94 days in Q1. Inventory balance was flat at $966 million quarter-over-quarter. Inventory turnover days reduced to 104 days in the second quarter compared to 120 days in Q1. Total debt was $1.9 billion to $1.8 billion at the end of Q1, in which $310 million was related to international solar project. Net debt was $1.2 billion compared to $1.1 billion at the end of Q1. The increase was due to the issuance of convertible senior notes in the second quarter.

This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator, we would like to take questions.

Operator

Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Philip Shen from Roth Capital Partners. Please go ahead.

Irwin Teg -- Roth Capital Partners -- Analyst

Hi, this is Irwin Teg [Phonetic]. I'm on for Philip today. Hope you guys are doing well. My first question is from Q1, you thought that 60% of your Q1 shipments were for non-subsidized project and as much as 50% of 2019 shipments could be for non-subsidized demand. How much of your Q2 shipments do you believe serve on subsidized markets? And what's your latest view for second half 2019 and possibly 2020?

Charlie Cao -- Chief Financial Officer

I think you are talking about, you know, the market without subsidy, right, grid parity. And the...

Irwin Teg -- Roth Capital Partners -- Analyst

Quite exactly.

Charlie Cao -- Chief Financial Officer

I think the trend is there, you know, the story is becoming more and more competitive and the most other regions are reaching to the grid parity markets. And back to your specific question. If you take China and Japan as subsidy supported market this year and we think our shipment quarter-by-quarter, the shipments ratings without subsidy increased step by step. And the second quarter, roughly 70% to 80%. And then looking to next year, China will be the biggest region to reaching grid parities. And this year we estimate China roughly 10% is projects without subsidy. And next year and with the government policy supported and the lower system costs. And we believe it's -- will be a huge lift next year in China for the projects without subsidy.

Irwin Teg -- Roth Capital Partners -- Analyst

Okay. Thank you. My next question is, what is your latest view of China demand in Q1 and Q2 for 2020? Have you heard when the government may release its next subsidy regime? And what do you think it looks like?

Charlie Cao -- Chief Financial Officer

Yes. For China market, as we said just now, China market will continue to be strong, not only in the second half 2019, but also in the 2020. So one part is there will be a lot of projects naturally and they'll continue to construct and try to get a grid connection in the first half of 2020. Meanwhile, there will -- there are a lot of -- let's say, projects in the plan, which is grid parity projects, and should be expected to be constructed by the year 2020. Regarding the rumors of the new schemes, we have heard of several versions of it, but I think we should wait for the official announcement.

Irwin Teg -- Roth Capital Partners -- Analyst

Okay, fair enough. And then my last question, and I'll pass it on. Last quarter you mentioned capex throughout the year was going to be about $450 million. We calculate about $212 million for the back half of 2019. Can you give me some more color on the capex for Q3 and Q4? Thank you.

Charlie Cao -- Chief Financial Officer

I think the total capex this year. You're right, roughly $450 million. And we have spended, I think roughly 50% of the total capex. And no, the remaining part, 50% will be spread over third quarter and fourth quarter. And our capacity actually, for both mono wafer capacity and PERC capacity are in the ramping up stage, and during the third quarter and expect to generate for -- reach to full operational output in fourth quarter.

Irwin Teg -- Roth Capital Partners -- Analyst

Okay, great. Thank you.

Charlie Cao -- Chief Financial Officer

Thank you.

Operator

Thank you. Your next question is from Brian Lee from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

Brian Lee -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe, maybe just another capex one on the back of that last one. So, the $450 million of capex for '19, it seems like that's in fact, can you give us some sense of -- in the prepared remarks you mentioned the 5 gigawatt Leshan facility going up to 16.5. What's the incremental capex for that? What's the expected timeline? Is that a first half 2020 capital expenditure plan? And then how much of the capital funding is being subsidized versus is coming off of your balance sheet?

Charlie Cao -- Chief Financial Officer

So, Brian, you are talking about the second phase 5 gigawatts, our new capacity, right? And we are doing that kickoff, the progression stage. It's another 5 gigwatts, and mono wafer capacity and they're making us to reach 16.5 gigawatts mono wafer capacities in the first half year of next year. And which will help us to support our growth next year. And back to the capex for this part, I think it's roughly $150 million. And the funding is from the China-based renewable equity fund, and we are working on?

Brian Lee -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Okay. But what percent, is that fully being funded by that fund that you mentioned or that $150 million portion? I guess maybe just to clarify, the $150 million is the gross capex and it's being fully covered by this third-party or maybe you could give us a split?

Charlie Cao -- Chief Financial Officer

Okay. It's roughly 70%, 80% covered by the equity part and the remaining part 20%, 30%, from the -- from third-party alone.

Brian Lee -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Okay, fair enough. I'll take the rest offline. Maybe shifting years, couple of housekeeping questions for you, Charlie. Was there any radio AD or CVD or other benefits in the second quarter reported gross margin or the 18% to 20% guided gross margin for 3Q?

Charlie Cao -- Chief Financial Officer

Okay. That's actually currently under -- compared to our peers, in solar, in second quarter, they recorded some AD, CVD, there was also subsidy. And we didn't have it in the second quarter and we estimated, we are going to have some number in the third quarter for the AD, CVD. But when we give the guidance, the 18%, 20% we've given consider this part.

Brian Lee -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Okay, so that's ex any benefit. Okay. And then any -- were there any project sales in the second quarter reported results or any embedded in the third quarter guidance, revenue guidance?

Charlie Cao -- Chief Financial Officer

So far, no. And for international projects, you're right, we are working very hard and we will -- we are in the process to monetize the international project. As we disclosed in my remarks, the total debt included roughly $310 million, the total debt for the four part projects which have -- we have connected. And we plan to sell two of the four projects in the fourth quarter. And after the completion of the sale of the two projects in the fourth quarter, roughly $170 million debt will be, get out on the balance sheet, for the remaining two projects we plan to sell down next year.

Brian Lee -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

What's the two projects for this year? What's the capacity, and expect, if you can -- expecting to close [Phonetic]?

Charlie Cao -- Chief Financial Officer

The two projects, roughly the capacity is 150 megawatts. The two projects been, you know, Mexico.

Brian Lee -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Okay. Right. And then maybe just last one for me and I'll pass it on. Just the -- yeah, I was surprised, the operating income increased you know, like 8% versus Q1 sequentially despite the much higher shipments in revenue. So, I know you had a big increase in EPS this quarter, but it seems a lot had to do with the forex gain and the income tax benefit and other below the line items. Is that fair? And then what should the income tax be going forward?

Charlie Cao -- Chief Financial Officer

You mean the tax benefit, right?

Brian Lee -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Yeah, the tax benefit. I know you can, forex gain and the tax?

Charlie Cao -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. And you know, for second quarter I think this it's, you know, good and beating our estimates. And if you look at some, you know, one-off items, we also get hit from the international projects, interest rate swap. It's kind of accounting -- accounting matters, because we didn't use the hedge accounting. So, you know, for the interest rate swap, and for the tax benefit, it's one-off item, it's in -- related to the last year 2018, the R&D additional income tax deductions for our Company as a whole. And so we didn't expect, you know the continued tax benefit in the second half year.

Brian Lee -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Okay, fair enough. Last one, and I promise to pass it on. The pricing in China I know you've been saying all year long like a lot of your peers have, that China is going to be back half weighted and it clearly looks like it's going way out that way. You know, we noticed that your pricing in China was something in the low $0.20 per watt for mono PERC volume. In one of the recent China auctions, I think it was SBIC. So it seems pretty low, you're not representing the pricing stability or strength into year end in China, which I think was your original view, you had talked about maybe even having the ability to raise prices. A module is moving through the back half. Can you talk to why you bid so aggressively and what that might mean for future years in 3Q and 4Q pricing wise in China?

Charlie Cao -- Chief Financial Officer

Okay. Firstly China is -- the developers were lucky, and because after the third quarter, because of the some kind of -- more capacity for the PERC sale, the PERC sale price has done a lot quarter-over-quarter. But, you know, in the first half year, the price is too high. The PERC producers that -- it generates huge gross profitability. And this build a foundation for a little bit lower the module price in the China market. And second one is, if you talk about the specific one project, the price and if you look out of the SOE, they're doing the bidding prices, some prices [Phonetic] they're planning for the next year. So this price is not purely, you know, the --

Gener Miao -- Chief Marketing Officer

Let me take that one. This is Gener, Brian. So for the pricing in China in general, we believe that Q4 will become stronger than Q3. Q3, I think will be the low point for the whole year in the second half for the market price, that's above the market price. And of course SBIC or other, you know, spot market place. I have to say, you know, every player has its unique understanding and a tactic about different customer approach and they have different understanding about the project pipeline, construction timelines, together with other project size and details. I think that -- I think that kind of commercial confidential, so we cannot disclose too much. But for us, we do not see such prices only for 2019. And that it will continue as a very big fundamental pipeline for 2020 as well.

Brian Lee -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst

Okay. I appreciate the additional color. Thanks, guys.

Gener Miao -- Chief Marketing Officer

Thank you.

Operator

Thank you. [Operator Instruction] Your next question is from Maheep from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.

Maheep Mandloi -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst

Hey, thanks for taking the questions. Just on the polysilicon cost structure, could you just talk over like what was the polysilicon cost in the quarter and about expectations for Q3 and Q4? And then just trying to triangulate, like seeing latest news in China that the polysilicon cost might go up. So trying to see like, what are you seeing at your end for that cost structure?

Charlie Cao -- Chief Financial Officer

I think the polysilicon spot price reached to the lowest level in second quarter and covered a little bit. And now we believe, it is roughly for the mono based polysilicon, the price is $9.5 per kilogram. And we expect, the price will be stable throughout the year. And the thing is, a lot of producers, they have new capacities coming out in the second quarter, but they need to -- they need more time to produce high quality mono based polysilicon. And so far we think that their production process is on the track. And so in general, we don't believe a big risk, for the polysilicon, the price going down dramatically.

Maheep Mandloi -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst

Got it. And just on guidance. It's definitely a Q4-weighted shipment guidance. Then a lot of it is probably because of China demand. But, are you seeing any higher demand from any other regions apart from China in Q4, like demand pull in US due to the tax credits are in Europe or other markets?

Charlie Cao -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. So, I think Maheep, definitely the Q4 demand will be stronger than Q3. Not only China demand is kicking in, but also, like you mentioned the US demand definitely is there. But is a problem, short of supply. And also, as you know, other markets such as Japan, India, the markets demand is still there.

Maheep Mandloi -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst

Got it. And, just, how do you see the demand shaping up in through the first half of 2020 or '20, the full year of next year. Just trying to understand your visibility for demand into the next year, especially given your wafer capacity expansion plans.

Gener Miao -- Chief Marketing Officer

For the market demand side, we believe that the year of 2020 will continue to grow compared with 2019 and is still a healthy global demand. If we look into the -- let's say the key market such as China, US, Europe, even India and Japan. The market demand is, all of the market demand in 2020 will be higher than 2019. So I think that's a fundamental growth for the whole industry and a very important reason why we are so confident about our expansion plan. Meanwhile, the customer end side, we continue to be sold out for several months to now. So we believe, we have a very good market demand for the future.

Maheep Mandloi -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst

Got it. And then just on the -- all the new technologies, which I had spoke about on the call on -- the thin films, one bifacial, larger amount of wafer sizes. So apart from the wafer capacity expansion, can you talk about which of these technologies would you be replicating across your capacity, across the supply. And just trying to understand like, how should we think about the capex for, say, going to bifacial or other technologies in 2020?

Gener Miao -- Chief Marketing Officer

So I think from the market demand point of view, we are -- like, marketing strategy point, we will continue to promote and launch our next generation of the products, which should be very attractive and very competitive in the market. We will -- I think we are planning to launch this soon. Meanwhile, overall -- all the products from Jinko side, even for the whole industry, we believe, the efficiency will continue to increase. The cost structure side will decrease, even diluted by the higher efficiency of the products. I think that's a roadmap followed by the whole industry. We will continue to contribute to the grid parity with more and more competitive also in cost all over the world.

Maheep Mandloi -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst

All right. Those are the most questions from me. Thanks for taking the questions.

WASHINGTON, Sept 4 (Reuters) - A federal judge reviewing a Justice Department decision to allow U.S. pharmacy chain and benefits manager CVS Health Corp  to merge with health insurer Aetna said on Wednesday that the agreement was in fact legal under antitrust law.

Judge Richard Leon of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia had been examining a government plan announced in October to allow the merger on condition that Aetna sell its Medicare prescription drug plan business to WellCare Health Plans Inc . Both deals have already closed.

""If the Tunney Act is to mean anything,"" Leon wrote, ""it surely must mean that no court should rubberstamp a consent decree approving the merger of 'one of the largest companies in the United States' and 'the nation's third largest health-insurance company,' ... simply because the Government requests it!""

In December, Leon said he was ""less convinced"" than the government that the asset sale to WellCare would resolve antitrust concerns. Since then, Centene Corp  agreed to acquire WellCare for $15.27 billion.

CVS said the judge's decision reinforced that CVS and Aetna have already merged.

""CVS Health and Aetna have been one company since November 2018, and today's action by the District Court makes that 100 percent clear. We remain focused on transforming the consumer health care experience in America,"" CVS spokesman T.J. Crawford said in an emailed statement.

The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Critics of the CVS-Aetna deal included the American Medical Association and the AIDS Healthcare Foundation.

Pending Leon's approval, CVS agreed to temporarily allow Aetna to independently make critical product, pricing and personnel decisions. 

CVS has been in the process of converting itself into a health-care company, and said in June that it would offer expanded health services such as nutrition counseling and blood pressure screenings in 1,500 stores by the end of 2021. 

Most consent agreements that the antitrust agencies strike with companies to resolve competitive concerns are approved by federal courts with little fuss under the 1974 Tunney Act, which requires courts to ensure the agreements are in the public interest.

2019-09-03 12:45:09," For their vacation to Italy last year, Angela Feher and a   friend from London had to figure out a workable way to share   costs. ""We looked into PayPal, and it would've cost us a fee. And   Venmo didn't work,"" says Feher, communications manager at TripIt,   a travel-planning app based in San Francisco. Despite the rise of peer-to-peer apps to send money online   free and easily, many options aren't available or have usage   restrictions outside the U.S., including Venmo, Zelle and   Square's Cash App. You'll need different cost-effective   strategies, an app or otherwise, to split meals and other   expenses on international trips with one or more friends.makeArticleAd(); First, have the right cards and cash Before leaving, consider payment options that won't charge you   for international use, and see if your traveling companions have   these, too:   Credit cards with no foreign transaction fees.      Most credit cards charge a fee, usually around 3% of the     purchase amount, for transactions made in other countries and     placed online from foreign merchants. See if you have or can     get a card that keeps foreign purchases fee-free.  Debit cards with no foreign ATM fees.      Since most U.S. banks don't have ATMs abroad, it's common to be     charged a fee to get cash overseas. But some online banks have     debit cards that don't charge foreign transaction or ATM fees,     and even reimburse you if an ATM operator does levy a     charge.  Foreign currency.      Your bank or credit union is     likely the cheapest place      to get hard currency for your travels, so visit a branch if     that's an option. Airport kiosks and foreign hotels typically     don't offer favorable exchange rates.  On her Italian getaway, Feher mostly paid for meals and   activities with a travel credit card that didn't charge foreign   transaction fees; her friend typically used euros she picked up   before leaving London. Then, choose how to split costs 1. Rotate who pays  Trading off might be easiest.    This worked best for Feher. She paid for the duo's train tickets   from Venice to Florence, for example, while her friend paid for a   pasta-making class. This strategy can work for large groups, too. Zarak Khan   celebrated his 30th birthday with 13 friends in Barcelona for a   week and they rotated who paid for meals, museum tickets and   other things. One friend tracked all expenses and found that by   week's end, only one had to pay another $14 to make everything   come out even. With this strategy, ""you give up a little bit in accuracy, but   you gain a lot in overall happiness,"" says Khan, behavioral   innovation director at Maritz, a company near St. Louis that   designs and manages incentive, loyalty and travel programs   grounded in behavioral science.

Instead of keeping receipts or using spreadsheets, free and   highly rated apps such as Splitwise and Splid keep IOUs organized   by group and person. You can split expenses equally or customize   the split, such as a situation where in a group of six one person   pays 75% and another pays 25% for the group's city tour. If you   want to feel in control of your travel budget, an app that   documents who owes what can be reassuring.  Reimburse back in the U.S.    When you return, you can use Venmo, cash or another form of   payment to square everyone up. This lets you avoid currency   conversion fees. 3. Send money with an international transfer app  You may want a different app to settle with friends who   live abroad.    Some apps such as TransferWise and OFX   send money online between currencies    without the steep costs banks charge for international wire   transfers. 4.

Airbnb and Uber both offer this split feature, which can remove   the question of who pays for certain accommodations or rides.   While it won't be an option for all expenses, it's handy and   worth keeping an eye out for. Whatever way you and your friends cover costs, having a plan   can make traveling with a partner or group a lot less   stressful.

KHARTOUM, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Sudan's prime minister has approved 14 civilian members of his cabinet, the first to be appointed since the overthrow of long-time leader Omar al-Bashir in April, a source said on Tuesday.

The nominations include Sudan's first female foreign minister, and a former World Bank economist as finance minister who will face an economic crisis that triggered months of protests against Bashir and has deepened in recent months.

Asmaa Abdallah had been chosen as foreign minister, according to the member of the Forces for Freedom and Change (FFC) grouping, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Ibrahim Elbadawi, a former World Bank economist who had been managing director of the Cairo-based think tank Economic Research Forum since 2017, would serve as finance minister and Adel Ibrahim was tapped to lead the Energy and Mining Ministry, the source added. 

General Jamal Aldin Omar, who was a member of the Transitional Military Council that took over from Bashir, will become defence minister, he said.

The government will lead a three-year transition to elections under a power-sharing deal between the military and civilian opposition.

Hamdok, speaking at a press conference in Khartoum alongside Germany's foreign minister, did not mention the appointments but said it would be ""logical"" for women to receive appropriate representation since ""the women of my country were on the frontline of this revolution"".      

""Sudan's economic challenge is a big challenge, but we can tackle it,"" Hamdok said. ""In the near-term, we need to address the shortage of commodity items - sugar, flour and petroleum."" 

""On the currency front, we need to stop inflation, deal with the exchange rate of the national currency, and restore confidence to the banking system,"" Hamdok said, adding he hoped to do so in six months to one year.     

Elbadawi, who has a PhD in economics from North Carolina State University, told Reuters in April that he hoped Sudan could get help from countries such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which pledged aid to the military council after Bashir's fall.

""Sudan essentially needs a mini-Marshall plan, given the destruction which happened in the country, and the corruption,"" he said at the time.

""I would think, from my experience at the World Bank, in three months you can actually have an agreement with the IMF for balance of payments support. As well as, of course - the World Bank can provide budget support.""

The FFC presented lists of candidates for all portfolios except for defence and interior, for which the military chose nominees. 

Consultations between Hamdok and the FFC were taking place for four ministries. Hamdok was expected to announce the full cabinet in the next two days, state news agency SUNA said.",Sudan's PM selects members of first cabinet since Bashir's ouster - Nasdaq.com,https://www.nasdaq.com/article/sudans-pm-selects-members-of-first-cabinet-since-bashirs-ouster-20190903-00895

2019-09-03 10:10:49,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Over the long run, network technology specialist Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ) makes investment sense. With a surge of innovations, especially the 5G network rollout, Cisco stock is incredibly relevant. Plus, with tech increasingly representing a geopolitical flashpoint, CSCO should enjoy strong government support.

However, these positive fundamentals currently clash with technical pressures. Despite a strong and relevant business, CSCO stock has been unable to avoid the fear resulting from potholes such as worrying economic metrics and the ongoing (and escalating) U.S.-China trade war.

Cisco stock is starting off September in a cloud of pessimism. In the prior month, shares lost more than 15% of their market value. As a generally stable and dividend-bearing equity, such a loss is certainly an eyesore.

To be fair, the company is doing all it can to avoid the red ink. For example, in its fiscal fourth quarter of 2019, CSCO produced a beat on both the top and bottom line. Against a per-share profitability target of 82 cents, the company delivered 83 cents. For the consensus revenue estimate of $13.38 billion, actual revenue came in at $13.43 billion.

Unfortunately, management disclosed that China revenue was down 25% on an annualized basis for Q4. Adding to the already acute trade war fears, CEO Chuck Robbins admitted, ""What we've seen is in the state on enterprises … we're just being - we're being uninvited to bid.""

With management's downgrade for both earnings and revenue in fiscal Q1 2020, Cisco stock had nowhere to go but down.

At the same time, the underlying narrative hasn't changed for CSCO stock. How then should investors respond to the market carnage?

Invariably, anybody looking at the fallout in the CSCO stock price without the full context will hesitate. With the broader indices also flashing warning signs, it doesn't seem like an ideal time to jump in.

However, such logic, although understandable, ignores the longer-term bull case for Cisco stock. And as you might expect, this positive narrative focuses on the 5G network.

At this point, everybody and their grandparents have heard of 5G. What makes Cisco stock stand out is the firm's underlying cohesive approach to the technology. As even their own website declares, if you can't monetize the innovation , 5G is merely a different cog in radio frequencies.

To that end, I appreciate management's directed acquisition strategies, including their plan to buyout Acacia Communications (NASDAQ: ACIA ) for $2.6 billion. In its native form, Acacia specializes in ""disruptive"" high-speed communications technologies. Particularly, Acacia is known within the networking industry for optical interconnect solutions.

Under the current technological landscape, high latency (or the time to transfer data from sender to receiver) and power consumptions represent major challenges. This is especially the case for data transmissions over long distances.

With areas such as cloud computing, data centers and video conferencing demanding lower latencies, an Acacia acquisition makes sense for Cisco and CSCO stock. Certainly, it gives the tech firm a competent, practical advantage in the 5G rollout.

And whether it wants to or not, Cisco plays a pivotal role in U.S. national interests . Increasingly, our geopolitical rivalries with China and Russia are evolving from kinetic concerns to digital ones. As such, you can expect the federal government to ease up on its aggressive stance against big tech.

However, Cisco stock isn't an easy bull argument to make because of the trade war. With national pride and political credibility at stake, neither side has demonstrated a willingness to concede.

Plus, we've already seen the devastating impact that the economic conflict had on CSCO. A 25% reduction in regional revenue is nothing to scoff at. The volatility is very concerning from a technical sentiment perspective. The initial wave of selling pressure that began in late July dropped CSCO stock below the 50-day moving average. Later, the earnings disappointment plunged shares below their 200-day moving average.

Right now, CSCO is in a no man's land. Given the overriding pessimism in the broader markets, I believe shares risk falling first before picking back up.

But if Cisco stock does drop to levels near what we saw early this year, I think it's an opportunity. As I mentioned above, Cisco is simply too important to the rollout of next-gen technologies. That should help mitigate volatility as we close out this year and head into the next.

As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The yoga and athleisure retailer looks impressive as it expands its business to further challenge everyone from Nike NKE  to Adidas ADDYY  . Overall, the second quarter earnings season has been a mixed bag for retailers. Department stores such as Nordstrom JWN  and Macy's M  have failed to inspire much investor confidence. Meanwhile, Walmart WMT  and Target TGT  continued to show they can thrive in the Amazon AMZN  age. Moving on, Lululemon's rise helped push the rest of the industry from Nike to Gap GPS  and L Brands' LB  Victoria's Secret to all roll out more yoga-focused and athleisure offerings. On top of that, the Vancouver, Canada-based company has expanded its menswear unit, introduced self-care products, and rolled out more outwear to better compete with the likes of Canada Goose GOOS  and The North Face VFC  . Going forward, Lululemon plans to extend its international push as it tries to expand beyond North America and Australia/New Zealand deeper into Asia and Europe. LULU is also currently testing a membership program and opened a massive new ""experiential"" store in Chicago. Furthermore, Lululemon has bolstered its e-commerce and digital business. Looking ahead, our current Zacks Consensus Estimates call for the firm's Q2 revenue and earnings to climb 16.7% and 25.4%, respectively.

2019-09-03 11:02:55,"Investors in Juniper Networks Inc (Symbol: JNPR) saw new options become available today, for the October 11th expiration. At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the JNPR options chain for the new October 11th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.

Because the $22.50 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 54%.

2019-09-03 11:40:47,"Investors in AGNC Investment Corp (Symbol: AGNC) saw new options become available today, for the October 11th expiration. At Stock Options Channel  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AGNC options chain for the new October 11th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.    The put contract at the $14.00 strike price has a current bid of 16 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $14.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $13.84 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AGNC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $14.59/share today. Because the $14.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 78%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.14% return on the cash commitment, or 10.98% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost  .  makeArticleAd();  Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for AGNC Investment Corp, and highlighting in green where the $14.00 strike is located relative to that history:       Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $15.50 strike price has a current bid of 4 cents. If an investor was to purchase shares of AGNC stock at the current price level of $14.59/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $15.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.51% if the stock gets called away at the October 11th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if AGNC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for AGNC Investment Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing AGNC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $15.50 strike highlighted in red:    Considering the fact that the $15.50 strike represents an approximate 6% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 96%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.27% boost of extra return to the investor, or 2.63% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost  .    The implied volatility in the put contract example is 28%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 22%.    Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $14.59) to be 13%.

The internet of things has been a hot topic for years now, but with a 5G revolution right around the corner, connected devices are garnering more and more attention. Trade tension with China has made the market shaky, especially in the tech space. However, when it comes to picking stocks to buy in the technology sector, the internet of things is a great place to start.

Here's a look at five stocks that offer exposure to the fast-growing internet of things market.

If you're looking for internet of things stocks to buy, the first place to look is network providers. None of the connectivity needed would be possible without telecoms building and maintaining infrastructure to support it. If everything goes according to plan and T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS ) and Sprint (NYSE: S ) merge, there are only three names to choose from on that list - T-Mobile, AT&T (NYSE: T ) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ ). A lot of people point to Verizon as the winner of the three, but the only telecom I'd be willing to bet on right now is T. 

T stock is cheap because the firm is weighed down by a massive debt pile that it acquired beefing up its content library in preparation for a new streaming service. Not everyone believes in AT&T's path forward, which explains the firm's ultra-low valuation. However, I think T stock's future looks bright in the streaming space and its position in 5G means the company has a definite future growth catalyst. With a near 6% dividend yield and a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 9.7, T stock is a cheap way to buy into the revolution.

Another internet of things stock that can't be overlooked is Honeywell (NYSE: HON ), an American company responsible for a wide range of connected household devices. Honeywell not only makes everything from connected fire alarms to thermostats for consumers, but the firm also delivers a wide range of connected solutions at the enterprise level as well. 

There's a lot to like about HON stock from its modest P/E of 18.4 to its respectable 2% dividend yield to the fact that it's been able to grow its earnings per share by 14% annually for the past three years. However, what I find most compelling about Honeywell is the fact that the firm is making big moves into the internet of things space in an unprecedented way. HON is pushing forward with connectivity as a service , a strategy that combines connected wearables with cloud-based applications in order to assist customers in creating more efficient organizations. 

It would be irresponsible to talk about internet of things stocks to buy without mentioning at least one healthcare play. The healthcare space holds a lot of potential for growth when it comes to connected devices because data collection is such an important part of the industry. DexCom  (NASDAQ: DXCM ) makes glucose monitors for people living with diabetes. DXCM stock is up 43% so far this year, though it's been a bumpy ride for investors. In just two years, DXCM is up 128% as its devices gained notoriety and investors started to take notice. 

Of course there is some risk buying into a stock that's been on a run up, but DexCom looks likely to keep climbing in the years ahead as it rolls out new devices at more affordable price points. DexCom is planning to roll out a new glucose monitor in late 2020 or early 2021 that will be smaller than the firm's G6 model. Its lower manufacturing costs mean it will be less expensive for consumers. Management is hoping that the new G7 model will help the firm break into other markets beyond glucose monitoring which would create an entirely new growth runway.

Another industry that can't be overlooked when it comes to the internet of things is the semiconductor space. The chips that power connected devices and the networks themselves are an integral part of the overall future of the internet of things. However, choosing which semiconductor stocks to buy right now is a tricky business as the industry has been up against some pretty strong headwinds in recent months. 

My pick here is Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ: SWKS ), a Massachusetts-based semiconductor firm whose share price has been on a roller coaster ride for the past year. The government's ban on sales to Huawei has hurt SWKS stock significantly -  in the third quarter the firm saw its revenue fall 14% and EPS were down a whopping 47%. 

However, the firm appears to be faring well in areas unaffected by the trade tension. The company is becoming a major player in the 5G space, and its connected chips can now be found in a variety of electronics including soundbars and smartwatches. The firm's tech is also included in Oculus headsets, Facebook's (NASDAQ: FB ) virtual reality arm.

So, although you're taking on a lot of risk considering that the trade war with China looks unlikely to let up anytime soon, SWKS could offer a great deal of reward as well. Not only will its connected chips drive growth in the future, but the firm's comparisons in 2020 will be much easier after the dismal year it's had. That means investors who can stomach the risk could see a payoff in just a few months time.

Payment processors will be another big beneficiary of a more connected world. As more and more devices make their way online, online payments will continue to rise. Part of the reason connected devices are gaining traction is that they reduce friction in people's lives. Cash has become friction for many people, leading developers to look for easier ways to allow people to pay for things without ever taking out their wallets. 

The two largest credit card networks, Visa  (NYSE: V ) and Master Card (NYSE: MA ) will be able to continue building their networks as people continue to opt for cashless payments. Don't get me wrong, V stock is expensive - it trades at almost 29 times its future earnings, but that extra cost is worth it. Visa makes money every time someone uses their credit or debit cards, and with trillions of dollars changing hands in Visa's name each year, that translates into some pretty impressive revenue figures. 

Guggenheim Securities analyst Jeff Cantwell said he also sees a lot of potential growth in Visa's business to business payments arm. Cantwell pointed out that V stock will benefit significantly as contactless payments spread and Visa pushes its way further into cross-border transactions, a $100 trillion market.

2019-09-03 07:34:00,"Despite what President Donald Trump has repeatedly said, tariffs are paid by the company importing goods, not the country where they were made. That generally raises the costs of the items being imported, an increase which normally gets passed on to consumers.

In some cases, however, the added cost can be partially, or even fully, absorbed by the vendor or retailer importing the goods. And Target (NYSE: TGT) has made it clear in a letter to vendors that it expects them to absorb the cost of the tariffs.

""As we look forward, Target will continue to keep guests at the heart of our strategy and continue to rely on your help and cooperation as tariff changes continue and uncertainty remains,"" wrote Target Chief Merchandising Officer Mark Tritton. ""Target will not accept any new cost increases related to tariffs on goods imported from China. Our expectation is that you will develop the appropriate contingency plans so that we don't have to pass price increases along to our guests.""

Target wants its vendors to absorb any tariffs. Image source: Target.

Tritton's letter acknowledged that many of its vendors sell items that will be impacted by the increased tariffs, some of which went into effect on Sept. 1 (others will take effect on Dec. 15). The first round will impact footwear, apparel, certain technology items, and other goods, while the second round will affect laptops and cellphones.

Target expects its vendors to either find alternative sources for the goods they sell the company, or simply eat the cost of the tariffs on goods imported from China . That's a big ask from the chain, which essentially makes it clear that it's not going to raise its prices or lower its own margins.

This puts vendors in a very challenging position. Some may be able to find alternative sourcing for goods, but others will have to choose between telling Target no -- and possibly losing the retailer as a customer -- or continuing to sell to the chain at a lower margin, or perhaps even a loss.

Target and its vendors have likely taken some steps to source goods from countries other than China. The problem is that factories can't be built quickly, and it's impossible to fully pivot away from the country without paying more to buy the items elsewhere (which causes the same problems tariffs do).

The National Retail Federation (NRF) has been very clear in its opposition to the tariffs, calling them a tax on Americans. NRF Senior Vice President for Government Relations released a statement that alludes to the dilemma Target's vendors face.

""It's impossible for businesses to plan for the future in this type of environment. The administration's approach clearly isn't working, and the answer isn't more taxes on American businesses and consumers. Where does this end?"" he said.

Target has significant leverage over many of its vendors. Some will likely balk at eating the added cost, but others will have no choice but to comply. It's really a question of whether they want to choke to death quickly by walking away from a huge customer, or starve to death by making less money.

At some point, the American consumer will pay these tariffs. Target may be able to force many vendors' hands for a while, but eventually businesses need to make money to survive, and many won't be able to take on the increased cost.

2019-09-03 15:14:00,"Sept 3 (Reuters) - More than 30 U.S. state attorneys general are readying an investigation into Alphabet Inc'sGoogle  for potential antitrust violations, a source knowledgeable about the probe said on Tuesday.

Texas leads the group of 30-plus attorneys general, which plans to announce the probe on Sept. 9, the source said.

Google said that it was cooperating with the state officials.

The probe is focused on the intersection of privacy and antitrust, according to the source, who did not elaborate.

Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general, filed comments along with 42 other state officials in June that urged the Federal Trade Commission to focus on privacy and data collection in investigating potential violations of antitrust law.

In the comment, the state officials argued that the big tech firms have so much user data that it is hard for newcomers to compete.

Another Texas official, Assistant Attorney General Jeff Mateer, alleged in an FTC hearing in June that Google and other big tech companies were misleading in representing themselves as neutral, citing Google's balking at carrying an ad about ""what it means to be an American, the Texas attorney general's office said in a statement in June. Google eventually relented on the ad, the statement said.

The tech giants, among the richest and most powerful companies in the world, are facing increasing antitrust scrutiny from Congress, federal agencies and now state attorneys general.

The Justice Department said in July that it was opening a broad investigation of major digital technology firms, focusing on whether they engage in anticompetitive practices. The investigation is believed to be aimed at Google, Amazon.com Inc  and Facebook Inc , and potentially Apple Inc . 

Separately, the Federal Trade Commission, which also enforces antitrust law, is also probing Amazon and Facebook to determine if they abused their massive market power in retail and social media, respectively.

2019-09-03 15:20:26,"Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel  , in trading on Tuesday, shares of Equitrans Midstream Corp (Symbol: ETRN) were yielding above the 14% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.8), with the stock changing hands as low as $12.61 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the iShares Russell 3000 ETF ( IWV  ) back on 5/31/2000 - you would have paid $78.27 per share. Fast forward to 5/31/2012 and each share was worth $77.79 on that date, a loss of $0.48 or 0.6% decrease over twelve years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $10.77 per share in dividends over the same period, increasing your return to 13.15%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.0%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 14% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Equitrans Midstream Corp (Symbol: ETRN) is a member of the Russell 3000, giving it special status as one of the largest 3000 companies on the U.S. stock markets.      In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Equitrans Midstream Corp, looking at the history chart for ETRN below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 14% annual yield.   makeArticleAd();   Click here to find out which 9 other dividend   stocks just recently went on sale »

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.

2019-09-03 10:18:00,"  TreeHouse Foods, Inc. THS  has been navigating through rough waters for a while now, owing to sluggish performance of Baked and Meal Solutions units. This also impacted results in second-quarter 2019, which hurt investor sentiment. Markedly, shares of this Illinois-based company have decreased approximately 15% in the past six months compared with the industry's growth of 9.4%.  makeArticleAd();  Nevertheless, the company's focus on its strategy for 2020 bodes well. Additionally, it is on track with its Structure to Win program, which is aimed at cutting costs. This apart, we commend TreeHouse Foods' focus on refining portfolio through buyouts and innovation.      Hurdles in TreeHouse Foods' Path    TreeHouse Foods is witnessing weakness in Baked and Meal Solutions units. Sales at Baked segment fell 6.9% year over year in the second quarter due to SKU rationalization, adverse volume/mix and currency. Net sales at Meals solutions unit declined almost 9.3% in the second quarter owing to SKU rationalization efforts, impacts from the divestiture of McCann's business, adverse volume/mix and currency rates.    Further, overall net sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and decreased year over year.  The downside was caused by SKU rationalization of low-margin businesses and the divestiture of McCann. This, along with management's unimpressive outlook for the third quarter, raises concerns.    Management expects third-quarter 2019 adjusted earnings in the range of 52-62 cents and net sales in the band of $1.04-$1.14 billion. The company delivered adjusted earnings per share of 62 cents in the third quarter of 2018, wherein net sales came in at roughly $1.4 billion.   Can Efforts Aid a Turnaround?    TreeHouse Foods is progressing well with the Structure to Win program, which focuses on aligning SG&A expenses with division structures. Markedly, the company generated Structure to Win savings worth $75 million in 2018, which exceeded original full-year target of $30 million and run-rate target of $55 million. It expects to maintain solid cost control in 2019, wherein it anticipates Structure to Win plan to continue yielding. This will enable TreeHouse Foods to cut SG&A expenses, which were earlier expected to decline by nearly $20 million (on a net basis) in 2019.    Additionally, the company is on track with TreeHouse 2020 strategic plan that was announced in second-quarter 2017. Alongside cost savings, the initiative is expected to manage the company's portfolio and optimize production and supply chain. The plan aims to improve operating margin by 300 basis points (bps) by the end of 2020, through complete business integration and expense management.    Apart from this, the company is trying to bolster footing in the organic foods space. Furthermore, it focuses on expanding product offerings through acquisitions. Some of the noteworthy buyouts include Private Brands, Flagstone Foods, and Naturally Fresh, Inc.    Notably, the company remains committed toward exiting underperforming businesses and shifting focus toward areas with high growth potential. To this end, management is on track with the sale of ready-to-eat cereal business to Post Holdings POST  , which was announced earlier. The ready-to-eat cereal unit is part of the company's baked goods segment. Also, with respect to its Snacks division, management announced that it has completed the divestiture of snack nuts and trail mix business to Atlas Holdings for $90 million in the second quarter. As a result, these businesses will form part of TreeHouse Foods' discontinued operations from the beginning of the third quarter.    These divestitures are expected to be accretive by nearly 19 cents to the bottom line in 2019. We believe, the aforementioned tailwinds have the potential to bring this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock back on growth trajectory.

2019-09-03 11:31:45,"Investors in OPKO Health Inc (Symbol: OPK) saw new options become available today, for the October 11th expiration. At Stock Options Channel  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the OPK options chain for the new October 11th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.    The put contract at the $1.50 strike price has a current bid of 5 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $1.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $1.45 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of OPK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $1.83/share today. Because the $1.50 strike represents an approximate 18% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 83%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.33% return on the cash commitment, or 32.02% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost  .  makeArticleAd();  Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for OPKO Health Inc, and highlighting in green where the $1.50 strike is located relative to that history:       Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $2.00 strike price has a current bid of 10 cents. If an investor was to purchase shares of OPK stock at the current price level of $1.83/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $2.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 14.75% if the stock gets called away at the October 11th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if OPK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for OPKO Health Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing OPK's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $2.00 strike highlighted in red:    Considering the fact that the $2.00 strike represents an approximate 9% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 58%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.46% boost of extra return to the investor, or 52.49% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost  .    The implied volatility in the put contract example is 136%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 111%.

2019-09-03 11:26:54,"While the demand for rare and precious metals used in electric vehicle battery production remains strong, investors are facing a unique situation where prices have fallen to record lows. One key metal, lithium, has seen its prices fall by more than 40% in the past year, a decline that has eaten into the profit margins of top producers and wiped out the majority of their share price gains over the past couple of years.

Among the companies hit the hardest by falling lithium prices is Albemarle (NYSE: ALB) , the world's largest lithium miner. With a market cap of $6.54 billion, shares of the lithium mining giant have fallen by 33.1% over the past few six months and 55% from its 2017 high. This drop isn't due to investors having a problem with Albemarle as a company but rather was caused by falling lithium prices. As such, many are now saying the stock is undervalued and could be a good investment today.

Despite the fact that lithium demand is expected to explode over the coming years with demand for electric vehicles projected to skyrocket, the metal's prices in 2019 have been falling due to an oversupply problem caused by an avalanche of new lithium supplies. Australia, which is the world's leading producer of the battery metal with an output of 51,000 tons per year, has seen six new major lithium mines begin operations since 2017. Chile is the second-largest producer with 16,000 tons of annual output and it has opened its door to foreign companies looking to explore for lithium in the resource-rich Atacama salt flat. Over the past two decades, output from Chile has quadrupled with other countries seeing a similar increase in production over the same period.

LITHIUM PRODUCERS ARE STRUGGLING AS PRICES PLUMMET. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.

Financing for junior and senior lithium and cobalt miners have also declined significantly as investors flee to more profitable mining sectors. The amount of investment capital available is seen as a proxy for investor confidence, and it has plummeted to all-time lows. In Q2 2019, the amount of cash raised on stock exchanges by lithium and cobalt miners fell to $34 million, a 96.2% decline from Q2 2018's $801 million raised. This decline in funding is also reflected in new drilling activity, with the number of newly completed drill holes having plummeted by more than 50% from its peak in Q3 2018.

Since hitting its peak in 2017, Albemarle has seen its stock slide by more than 50% due almost entirely to the lithium oversupply problem. In response to the supply glut, the company decided to mothball its plans to add an extra 125,000 tons of processing capacity across all its facilities. Albemarle currently operates two major lithium sites, one in Silver Peak, Nevada and the other in Salar de Atacama, Chile, and it has postponed future expansions into Australia. Instead, Albemarle plans to reduce capital expenditure by $1.5 billion over the next few years and become cash-flow positive 2021.

While it's easy to see why on a short-term basis the outlook for lithium producers isn't good, the silver lining behind this lithium glut is that it will force companies like Albemarle to cut down on the operational fat and become more efficient. In the next 24 months, demand for lithium will likely see an exponential increase, catching up to the current supply level as electrical vehicle production continues taking off.

This seems to paint an excellent picture for the company, which is now trading at a 50% discount from the previous year due primarily to market factors outside its control. Besides being attractive from a value perspective, with the stock trading at 12 times earnings whereas historically it has traded closer to 15 times earnings, Albemarle has a strong dividend track record. The company has consistently raised its dividend every year for 25 years and currently offers a 2.38% dividend yield.

If the company's management team follows through on its commitment to cut capital expenditures and become cash-flow positive again, Albemarle might become one of the top value stocks in the mining industry. Addressing these two areas is especially important, as these issues have deterred investors from buying this company's stock in the past. Fixing its cash-flows and curbing capital expenditures would easily make Albemarle a strong value play for investors looking for exposure to the electric vehicle market.

The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock's current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.    On this front, Kraton has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 6.61, as you can see in the chart below:      This level actually compares favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 18.02. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Kraton's current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 13.14 over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months. However, the current level stands below the highs for the stock, suggesting that it can be a solid entry point.      Moreover, the stock's PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Basic Materials Market sector's trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 13.98. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.      We should also point out that Kraton has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year's earnings) of 6.43, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Kraton's stock in the near term too.   P/S Ratio    Another key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock's price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.    Right now, Kraton has a P/S ratio of about 0.46. This is much lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.17 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.    Broad Value Outlook    In aggregate, Kraton currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Kraton a solid choice for value investors.    For example, P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 3.5, which is marginally better than the industry average of 9.46. Clearly, KRA is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.   What About the Stock Overall?    Though Kraton might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and Momentum Score of C. This gives KRA a Zacks VGM score - or its overarching fundamental grade - of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>  )    Meanwhile, the company's recen t earnings  estimates have been mixed at the best. The current quarter estimate witnessed no upward revision in the past sixty days compared to two downward revisions, while the current year estimate witnessed two upward revisions compared to no downward revision in the same time period.    As a result, the current quarter consensus estimate declined 4.1% in the past two months, whereas the current year estimate increased 8.4%.

2019-09-03 16:00:00,"SYDNEY, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Meal delivery service DoorDash Inc said it will begin taking orders in the Australian city of Melbourne on Wednesday, its first foray outside North America, adding to the competition in the country's home-delivery service market.

The biggest U.S. food delivery company will take on Uber Technologies Inc'sUber Eats, Just Eats Plc's  Menulog and Britain's Deliveroo just as the Australian food delivery market shows signs of slowing after years of rapid growth, according to official figures.

Doordash said in a statement it would sell deliveries from thousands of restaurants in the central business district and inner suburbs of Australia's second-largest city with plans to expand to the rest of the world's No. 14 economy by the end of 2020.

With cheaper real estate than Sydney, Uber has routinely launched new offerings in the city, while several Chinese and Singapore-owned dockless bicycle rental companies have picked Melbourne to start in Australia.

""We dove deep into the Australian market and quickly realised two things; restaurants want more from their delivery partners, and not all Melburnians have access to the selection that they should expect,"" said DoorDash General Manager, Australia, Thomas Stephens, in a statement.

San Francisco-based DoorDash, whose investors include Japanese holding conglomerate SoftBank (9984.T), Sequoia Capital and Charles River Ventures, was founded in 2013 by Stanford students Andy Fang, Stanley Tang, Tony Xu and Evan Moore.

Last month, the company raised $250 million in a new round of funding co-led by Coatue Management and DST Global, valuing the company at $4 billion.

The food delivery market makes money by pairing restaurants with private delivery drivers on a smartphone app, for a fee.

The market in Australia has become crowded fast, with Just Eat taking a hefty writedown on its Menulog brand in 2017, two years after buying it, while German-owned Foodora closed its Australian operation in 2018 after three years.",DoorDash spreads beyond North America with Australia launch - Nasdaq.com,https://www.nasdaq.com/article/doordash-spreads-beyond-north-america-with-australia-launch-20190903-01151
2019-09-03 10:42:13,"In the stock market, once a story takes hold and an idea becomes conventional wisdom, it can be a very powerful thing. If, for example you got ten dollars for every time somebody said that retail was doomed, you might not get rich, but you would receive a steady income. That view seems at times to be ubiquitous, and most retail stocks have been under pressure for some time as a result.

The problem is that it is a massive generalization.

For sure, traditional retail operations, when taken on average, are suffering as shopping habits change, but that average obscures a wide range of results and prospects. That creates opportunity in stocks dragged down by the general pessimism, but where the company is defying the odds and doing well.

That brings us to the Texas-based home furnishings chain Conn’s (CONN), who released earnings this morning.

They beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines, which has caused the stock to jump well over ten percent in this morning’s premarket, but the nature of those beats suggests that that is just the beginning of what should be a long-term recovery.

Prior to this morning’s release, CONN’s chart looked like a typical retail stock this year, losing around half its value over the last 52 weeks. However, the low was reached back in June when the stock bottomed out after beating expectations in that month’s earnings report. This, then, is the second consecutive beat.

In retail, that is often not as impressive as its sounds. Analysts are fully aware of, and influenced by, the prevailing mood of doom and gloom around the sector, and forecasts have been being adjusted downwards for some time, making beats easier to come by. What is impressive about Conn’s last quarter is that it didn’t come from cutting back faster than anticipated, it was based on real growth.

Total retail sales increased by 3.3%, with same-store sales rising 0.4% in CONN’s last quarter. EPS rose 17% to $0.62 on a gross margin of over 40%. That is solid, if not spectacular, but it reflects the fact that rather than assume that retail pessimism applies to them, Conn’s continues to grow.

They announced that they are expanding into Florida for example, where they see room for around forty stores, but they remain regional, with operations in sixteen states if you include that expansion. That leaves lots of room for further growth.

None of this is to say that things are perfect, of course. Conn’s does carry a fairly heavy debt load, something which will have contributed to the big 52-week losses in such a pessimistic environment. As it stands however, the expansion is paying for itself and they have positive free cash flow, even as they continue to reinvest.

If I had my choice, I would rather see excess profits used to pay down that debt to ensure long-term stability rather than for the stock repurchase program that is ongoing, although that does provide some short-term support for the stock.

The real appeal of CONN is that it is cheap. The forward P/E of 7.25 is at odds with the reality of a company that is growing both sales and profits, as reflected in the PEG ratio of 0.32. It seems that investors are looking at CONN as just another retail stock, beset by all the problems that implies. That is obscuring the fact that they are a company that is growing at a reasonable pace, with plenty of room to continue to do so.

As to when to buy, it may well be that there will be a drop back from this morning’s initial pop given the fact that all the major stock market indices are indicating a significantly lower opening this morning. So, for potential buyers, holding off for a day or so may be advantageous in the short term ... don’t wait too long.

As I have frequently said in the past, perception and mood can drive markets for a surprisingly long time, but eventually reality wins. The reality here is that Conn’s is the exception to the rule that retail is dying, and the perception that there is no such thing as an exception just means that investors can pick up the stock at a big discount.

2019-09-03 12:07:00,"By Jonnelle Marte and Trevor Hunnicutt

NEW YORK, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve's balance sheet could end up between $3.8 trillion and $4.7 trillion by 2025, according to projections collected by the New York Fed.

The regional arm of the central bank, which manages the Fed's massive bond holdings, released the projections in a report on Tuesday drawn from surveys of Wall Street traders.

After the crisis, the Fed bulked up its holdings by buying Treasuries using bank reserves it created. Eventually, it started letting bonds and reserves decline to bring policy back to normal.

In July, Fed officials decided to end that bond roll-off by August. They made the decision at the same time as they cut rates for the first time in more than a decade, citing inflation that has fallen below their target, the U.S.-China trade war and other economic concerns. 

To keep control of rates, officials will eventually have to start buying bonds again and building up bank reserves.

The latest estimates are based on multiple scenarios of how quickly parts of the Fed's liabilities will grow, especially the reserves it holds for banks, currently around $1.5 trillion.

Major investors and traders polled by the New York Fed saw those reserves falling to between $1.1 trillion and $1.25 trillion before rising to between $1.2 trillion and $1.5 trillion in 2025, according to the report.

2019-09-03 09:38:32,"Stocks are trading lower in Europe as we approach the U.S. cash market opening. The European markets are primarily being pressured by Brexit concerns. According to reports, British opposition lawmakers are making a bid to seize control of the House of Commons and force a stop to the move that would allow the U.K. to leave the European Union with a deal on October, the so-called ""hard Brexit"".

At 13:12 GMT, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 is trading 7258.08, down 23.86 or 0.33%. Germany's Dax is at 11916.36, down 37.42 or -0.31% and France's CAC is at 5465.26, down 27.78 or -0.51%.

Although there are some concerns over an escalation of the trade dispute between the United States and China due to the imposition of fresh tariffs by both parties over the weekend, the primary focus for European stock traders is Brexit.

Earlier in the session, rebel lawmakers applied for an emergency debate in parliament in the hope of thwarting a no-deal Brexit.

According to British law, if the request for the debate is granted by the House Speaker John Bercow, opposition lawmakers could have a vote on Tuesday evening to wrestle control of parliamentary business away from the government. This move would be viewed as a ""de facto confidence vote on Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Brexit strategy,"" according to CNBC. This could push the Brexit deadline from October 31 to January 31, 2020.

The focus would then shift to Johnson, who would call for a snap general election on October 14 if a cross-party group of MPs (Members of Parliament), including some rebels from within Johnson's own ruling Conservative Party, succeed with a legislative bill to block a no-deal departure.

Shares in the Asia Pacific region finished mixed on Tuesday with Japan and China the lone winners.

Formal U.S.-China trade negotiations are set to resume this week after the two economic powerhouses implemented more tariffs on September 1. One analyst says he doesn't expect much progress to be made with this round of talks.

Tapas Strickland, director of economics and markets at the National Australia Bank, wrote in a morning note, ""US-China still remain no closer to easing tensions with a date for negotiators to meet in September yet to be determined.""

""With the 70 th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1, we do not expect much progress on trade in the near-term as China's focus increasingly turns towards the anniversary celebrations and then the Party's Fourth Plenum scheduled also for October,"" Strickland.

Early Tuesday, the Reserve Bank of Australia ( RBA ) kept its cash rate at 1% as expected. The RBA previously cut interest rates in June and July. Since then it has adopted a ""wait and see"" stance.

""It is reasonable to expect that an extended period of low interest rates will be required in Australia to make progress in reducing unemployment and achieve more assured progress toward the inflation target,"" Governor Philip Lowe said in a statement.

[Editor's note: This story was previously published in June 2019. It has since been updated and republished.]

The best Fidelity funds for 2019 include a diversified set of mutual funds that can prepare your portfolio for volatility, rising interest rates and downside pressure on stocks. Fidelity offers dozens of actively-managed funds with above-average performance and below-average expense ratios.

Fidelity also offers some of the lowest-cost index funds available in the mutual fund universe. This combination of choices makes Fidelity funds one of the best one-stop shops for mutual funds.

Another distinction of Fidelity Investments is that some of its best funds concentrate on sectors, which may prove to be valuable for portfolio construction in 2019.

So, if you're looking for the best mutual funds to own in 2019, you could build an entire portfolio for the year with these Fidelity funds.

Expenses:  0.015%, or $1.50 for every $10,000 invested

Formerly Fidelity Spartan 500 Index Investor Shares, the Fidelity 500 Index Fund (MUTF: FXAIX ) is a smart and extremely cheap way to get diversified access to large U.S. companies.

FXAIX tracks the S&P 500 index, which includes stocks of over 500 of the largest U.S. companies like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ).

While 2019 still may see more of the volatility and downside pressure on stocks like investors saw in the fourth quarter of 2018, FXAIX and similar S&P 500 index funds can be smart, core holdings for long-term investors.

Expenses:  0.45%

For your fixed income core holding in 2019, you'll need a low-cost, diversified total bond market fund like Fidelity Total Bond Fund (MUTF: FTBFX ).

Although bond prices could see downside pressure from rising rates in 2019, a slowing economy can cause the Fed to continue to pause its rate-hike campaign.

Two to three rate hikes are already priced in. If the Fed pauses after one or two rate hikes in 2019, long-term bonds will jump in price faster than short-term bonds.

This uncertainty makes a diversified fund like FXAIX a wise fund to hold in 2019. The fund's portfolio covers the entire U.S. bond market.

Expenses:  0.45%

To help defend against interest rate risk in 2019, a smart complement to your core bond holding is Fidelity Short-Term Bond Fund (MUTF: FSHBX ).

When interest rates are rising, bond funds that hold bonds with short average maturity tend to perform better than those with long average maturity. This is because demand for yesterday's lower-rate bonds decreases while demand for today's higher-rate bonds increases.

Therefore, the longer the maturity, the greater the fall in price.

FSHBX can either complement a core bond fund or it can potentially provide greater yields than money market funds.

Expenses:  0.72%

The health sector was a top performer in 2018 and its defensive qualities look to carry momentum through 2019.

The best Fidelity fund to gain exposure to the health sector is  Fidelity Select Health Care Portfolio  (MUTF: FSPHX ). Since health sector funds make good defensive plays, FSPHX can provide downside protection should the market continue its downward trend during the year.

The FSPHX portfolio has a healthy dose of biotech stocks, at about one-third allocation, and the remaining two-thirds is in other health sub-sectors like healthcare equipment, pharmaceuticals and managed care. Top holdings in FSPHX include UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH ), Becton, Dickenson & Co (NYSE: BDX ), and Boston Scientific Corp (NYSE: BSX ).

Expenses:  0.05%

An inflationary environment in 2019 may prove to be good for Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, and funds that invest in them, such as  Fidelity Inflation-Protected Bond Index Fund  (MUTF: FIPDX ).

Inflation remains relatively low but is expected to rise in 2019 and this environment is ripe for holding TIPS.

An additional purpose for holding a TIPS funds is to diversify the fixed income portion of your portfolio.

Therefore, TIPS funds may be smart holdings for both short-term and long-term investors.

Expenses:  0.78%

Stagflation in 2019 is increasingly looking like a real possible outcome making Fidelity Select Utilities Portfolio (MUTF: FSUTX ) a smart holding.

A slowing economy and inflation combine to make stagflation, which can be a challenging environment for stocks. Sectors that can perform well relative to others in this environment include health, energy and utilities.

The FSUTX portfolio consists of high-quality U.S. large-cap utilities like NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE ), PG&E Corp (NYSE: PCG ) and Dominion Energy (NYSE: D ).

Expenses:  0.77%

Fidelity Select Consumer Staples Portfolio (MUTF: FDFAX ) a smart holding for the year, especially as volatility looms.

Consumer staples, like the healthcare and utility sectors, can serve the dual purpose of protecting against stagflation in the economy and volatility in the stock market. 2019 could bring both scenarios, which could make consumer staples sector funds like FDFAX market leaders this year.

In a stagnant economy and weakening market, consumer stocks such as the top holdings in FDFAX Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO ), Proctor & Gamble (NYSE: PG ), Philip Morris (NYSE: PM ) can outperform the broad market indices.

As of this writing, Kent Thune did not personally hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities, although he holds FXAIX in some client accounts. His No. 1 holding is his privately held investment advisory firm in Hilton Head Island, S.C. Under no circumstances does this information represent a recommendation to buy or sell securities.

2019-09-03 11:31:55,"In trading on Tuesday, shares of EQM Midstream Partners LP (Symbol: EQM) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $29.61 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.    In the case of EQM Midstream Partners LP, the RSI reading has hit 29.2 - by comparison, the universe of energy stocks covered by Energy Stock Channel  currently has an average RSI of 45.3, the RSI of WTI Crude Oil  is at 42.0, the RSI of Henry Hub Natural Gas  is presently 62.9, and the 3-2-1 Crack Spread  RSI is 22.8. A bullish investor could look at EQM's 29.2 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.    Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), EQM's low point in its 52 week range is $29.11 per share, with $58 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $29.77.

2019-09-03 06:40:00," Value style is considered one of the best practices when it comes to picking stocks. There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock's inherent strength but a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company's financial position. For this, we would suggest Price to Cash Flow  (or P/CF) ratio as one of the key metrics. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis - the lower the number, the better. One of the important factors that make P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing the financial health of a company. Analysts caution that a company's earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. It is net cash flow that unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same. Positive cash flow indicates an increase in a company's liquid assets. It gives the company the means to settle debt, shell out for its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company's liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.

Value style is considered one of the best practices when it comes to picking stocks. There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock's inherent strength but a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company's financial position. For this, we would suggest Price to Cash Flow  (or P/CF) ratio as one of the key metrics.

This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis - the lower the number, the better. One of the important factors that make P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing the financial health of a company.

Analysts caution that a company's earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. It is net cash flow that unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same.

Positive cash flow indicates an increase in a company's liquid assets. It gives the company the means to settle debt, shell out for its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company's liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.

However, an investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and also consider price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  Value Score   of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.

2019-09-03 13:47:14,"Legendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.    In trading on Tuesday, shares of GCP Applied Technologies Inc (Symbol: GCP) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 29.8, after changing hands as low as $17.04 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF ( SPY  ) is 48.1. A bullish investor could look at GCP's 29.8 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.

Also, strong prospects across the business and a strong brand presence are adding to the bliss. Shares of AECOM have outperformed its industry  in the year-to-date period. The stock has gained 33.9% compared with the industry's rally of 12.9% in the same period.  makeArticleAd();  However, demand for AECOM's services is highly dependent on general economic conditions. This is the company's biggest concern. Also, volatility in commodity prices and extreme dependency on government projects add to the woes.    Let's delve deeper into factors that substantiate its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here   .         Major Growth Drivers    AECOM's business has been witnessing strong prospects across segments. The company, which shares space with KBR, Inc. KBR  , Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. JEC  and Altair Engineering Inc. ALTR  in the industry, reported strong backlog at the end of fiscal third-quarter 2019. The backlog was up 10% year over year. New order wins were $21.2 billion, with a total book-to-burn ratio of 1.3. Its solid backlog and contract wins, which are key indicators of future revenue growth, indicate significant opportunities in the forthcoming quarters.    Of the three reportable segments, AECOM's Design and Consulting Services or DCS (which contributed 41.3% to total third-quarter fiscal 2019 revenues) and Management Services or MS (20.6%) segments are major growth drivers. In both the segments, the company is pursuing a multi-billion-dollar pipeline of opportunities. It expects the growth trend of both the segments to continue in fiscal 2019 as well. Particularly in the MS business, backlog increased nearly 127% since the start of fiscal 2017. AECOM expects the impressive level of backlog of large commercial, stadia and power projects to drive another year of revenue growth and margins.    It remains on track with the five-year financial plan through fiscal 2022 to deliver more than 5% revenue CAGR, at least 9% adjusted EBITDA CAGR, 12-15% adjusted EPS CAGR and not less than $3.5 billion of cumulative free cash flow.    AECOM remains on track with its $225-million General and Administrative (G&A) reduction plan in order to improve profitability and de-risk the business profile. This move is anticipated to benefit its DCS segment. Notably, the company lifted its fiscal 2022 adjusted operating margin target in the DCS segment to nearly 8%, indicating growth of 100 basis points (bps) from fiscal 2019 expectation and 210 bps from the fiscal 2018 level.    Markedly, favorable infrastructure spending in the United States, United Kingdom and Australia is helping AECOM's business. The majority of the U.S. government's $1.5-trillion infrastructural plan is focused on transit and water markets, wherein AECOM enjoys a dominant share.   Causes of Concerns    Demand for AECOM's services is cyclical, and hence largely vulnerable to reduction in government and private industrial spending.    Notably, its Construction Services or CS segment, which added 38.1% to total revenues, declined 10% in the fiscal third quarter and 4.7% in first nine months of the fiscal year, owing to lower contribution from Building Construction and Power businesses.    Dependence on political and economic conditions is a major concern. Moreover, considerable international exposure makes the company highly vulnerable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Also, AECOM's widespread geographical presence makes it vulnerable to trade policies, tariffs and taxes.

2019-09-03 11:52:00,"Renewable energy stocks have teased investors with their promise for years. On the one hand, it's easy to dream on the sector's growth potential given the need to transition the global economy away from its current fossil fuel-based approach to a more sustainable one. According to one estimate, the world's developed economies need to invest a staggering $10 trillion in the coming years to make the switch. However, despite all the investments in the sector, most clean energy stocks have significantly underperformed the market over the years.

Two factors have driven this underperformance: intense competition and weak financial profiles. With so many companies focused on doing the same thing, the industry has fought against itself for growth opportunities, which has hurt investment returns. Meanwhile, most clean energy companies focused on growing as fast as they could despite the lackluster returns. As a result, many stretched themselves too thin, putting pressure on their balance sheets and stock prices and burning investors in the process.

A small group of renewable energy companies, however, have thrived despite the sector's issues. That's allowed them to consistently create value for their investors over the years.

One of the defining characteristics of these outperformers is that they aim to grow the value of their company, not just its size. Thus, those who want to invest in renewable energy stocks should seek out companies focused on this pursuit.

While many companies want to profit from the renewable energy sector's growth potential, far fewer have a visible plan aimed first at increasing shareholder value. That makes them stand out as the top investment options in the space.

Given the outsize growth potential of the renewable energy sector, most companies focused on the industry should be able to increase their revenue in the coming years. Far fewer will be able to expand their profitability, especially on a per-share basis due to competition and financial concerns.

The following four companies, however, have a plan to grow their earnings per share, which increases the probability that they'll produce market-beating returns for their investors:

Data source: Company investor presentations.

Here's a closer look at what makes them the top renewable stocks to buy for the long term.

Brookfield Renewable Partners is one of the largest renewable energy companies in the world. It boasts a globally diversified, multitechnology renewable power platform that includes:

As of August 2019, hydro made up 75% of the company's portfolio followed by wind at 21% and solar at 4%.

Brookfield makes money by selling the bulk of the renewable energy it generates to customers like utilities under long-term, fixed-rate power purchase agreements (PPAs). These contracts provide the company with predictable cash flow while insulating it from volatile power prices. The company typically distributes the bulk of its cash flow (80% on average) back to investors via a high-yield dividend . It reinvests the rest into building or buying additional renewable energy-generating assets.

The company has a high hurdle rate for new investments, targeting opportunities that will generate 12% to 15% total returns over the long-term. It's able to achieve this goal by investing on a value basis, leveraging its operational expertise, and remaining disciplined. Brookfield typically targets opportunities where it can buy underperforming assets and turn them around by improving their operations and cost structure.

Brookfield's focus on improving is evident in its long-term outlook. The company aims to grow its cash flow per share at a 6% to 11% annual rate through at least 2022, which should allow it to increase its dividend at a 5% to 9% yearly pace. One factor powering that plan is the company's ability to improve the profitability of its existing assets. That factor alone should supply it with half of its cash flow growth over that time frame. The other half will come from building new renewable projects that meet the high bar it's set for investment return.

The company's value-focused approach has paid big dividends over the years. In the two decades since its inception through mid-2019, Brookfield has generated a 16% annualized total return. For comparison's sake, the S&P 500 only delivered a 7% total annualized return over that time frame.

If there's one concern with Brookfield Renewable, it's that some of its operations reside in economically sensitive countries like Brazil. The company takes steps to reduce its risks in those regions by using hedging contracts to lock in currency rates and power prices. However, a prolonged economic slump could negatively impact its earnings and weigh on its market value.

While Brookfield Renewable Partners has battled its share of ups and downs over the years, it has proven that slow and steady can win the race. The company has consistently grown its cash flow by investing in opportunities that meet its strict criteria. That's enabled it to routinely increase its distribution to investors, allowing them to collect a growing income stream. That trend isn't showing any signs of stopping, which is why Brookfield Renewable is a great clean energy stock to buy for the long term.

First Solar is a solar panel manufacturer. However, it differentiates itself from most competitors in two ways.

First, the company develops and manufactures thin-film modules that use cadmium telluride as a semiconductor instead of the conventional crystalline silicon technology. While these panels aren't as efficient in converting the sun's rays into electricity, they have a lower cost per watt.

First Solar offsets some of the efficiency loss by making larger panels compared to those produced by its competitors. On the one hand, this makes them less suitable for residential rooftops. However, they're ideal for utility-scale projects that connect to the grid since it doesn't have to install as many panels per project to produce the same amount of power. Consequently, First Solar has developed and operates many of the world's largest grid-connected solar power plants.

Secondly, First Solar's history of innovation sets it apart from the competition. While many rivals focus on manufacturing low-cost silicon-based panels, First Solar invests industry-leading amounts of capital into developing more efficient thin-film solar panels. Its more-innovative products carry higher margins, which enables it to make more money. In 2018, it launched its latest innovative product, the Series 6 module, which is even more efficient than the Series 4 panel it's replacing. The company decided to completely skip the launch of the Series 5 module and accelerate the migration to the larger Series 6 because it was more cost-competitive with rival panels.

The company invested more than $1 billion into Series 6, which included research and development (R&D) costs, as well as building out manufacturing capacity in the U.S. and Asia. That investment should start paying off in 2019. Its earnings are on track to surge more than 80% year over year at the midpoint of its forecast. That accelerated earnings-per-share growth should continue in the years that follow as it cashes in on its investment in the Series 6 module.

Despite its massive investments in R&D, First Solar has managed to maintain one of the best balance sheets in the solar sector. The company expects to end 2019 with between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion of net cash. That cash-rich balance sheet gives it an unmatched competitive advantage versus its financially weaker peers, most of which are weighed down by a mountain of expansion-fueled debt. First Solar, on the other hand, has the unparalleled financial flexibility to continue investing to increase its capacity as well as on its next innovation.

While First Solar is a top-tier solar panel manufacturer, it operates in a highly competitive industry. Because of that, the company needs to continue pouring money into R&D so that it doesn't lose its competitive edge. If it fails to innovate, it might start falling behind. It also needs to battle against rising costs and falling panel prices by keeping its expenses at bay to protect its profit margins.

In spite of those risks, First Solar appears well positioned to prosper thanks to its strong balance sheet, healthy earnings growth prospects, and a history of innovation. That combination should give it the power to generate market-beating returns in the coming years.

NextEra Energy is a clean energy -focused company. It operates two distinct businesses:

NextEra Energy's affiliates combine to generate more electricity from the wind and sun than any other company in the world. In addition, it's a leader in battery storage.

The company's regulated utilities produce energy from a variety of sources (including natural gas, nuclear, coal, and solar) and distribute it as well as natural gas to customers. These businesses generate relatively predictable income since regulatory bodies set rates and demand tends to increase at a steady pace as Florida's population and economy expand.

NextEra's energy resources segment owns an extensive portfolio of power-generating facilities including wind, solar, nuclear, natural gas, and oil. In addition to that, the company operates a meaningful natural gas pipeline business. The company sells the power it produces under long-term PPAs and leases capacity on its gas pipelines via long-term contracts. Those agreements enable NextEra to churn out predictable cash flow.

NextEra has a long history of creating value for investors by consistently growing its earnings and dividend. From 2003 through 2018, the company increased its adjusted earnings per share at a 7.8% compounded annual rate while boosting the shareholder payout at a 9.1% yearly pace. That consistent growth has enabled the utility to generate market-crushing returns. In the decade from 2008 through 2018, it produced a 380% total return, which outpaced not only its utility peers (170% total return over that time frame) but also the S&P 500 (243%).

The utility firmly believes it can continue to grow earnings at a healthy clip in the coming years. Powering NextEra's forecast is a massive backlog of expansion projects. The company expects to invest from $23 billion to $25 billion in Florida Power & Light from 2019 to 2022 and another $2.9 billion to $3.3 billion in Gulf Power on a variety of projects, including new solar capacity. It has lined up $25 billion to $28 billion of investments at energy resources, mainly on renewables. The company currently expects to build 11.7 GW of renewable projects over that time frame. That would boost its industry-leading portfolio, which consisted of 18 GW of wind and solar capacity in August 2019.

While NextEra Energy has a strong balance sheet, it will be investing a significant amount of money in expanding its operations over the next several years. At the same time, it plans to continue increasing its above-average dividend. That will be a tough balancing act. The company will likely need to secure substantial amounts of outside funding to bridge the gap, including selling assets to its MLPNextEra Energy Partners . If it runs into trouble obtaining financing, then it might not grow its earnings at as fast as it expects.

The company, however, does have a long history of being able to finance its growth while increasing the dividend. That's why it firmly believes it can deliver on its growth plan. That outlook would see earnings per share expand at a 6% to 8% compound annual rate through at least 2022 from 2018's base. The company also expects to receive an additional earnings boost in 2020 and 2021 from the integration of its acquisition of Gulf Power as its cost-saving initiatives start paying off. That would enable NextEra to continue to increase its dividend at a healthy rate during that period, which should give it the power to keep producing market-beating total returns.

TerraForm Power focuses on owning and operating wind and solar power assets in North America and Western Europe. As of the middle of 2019, 64% of the company's portfolio consisted of wind assets, while the rest was solar.

Like Brookfield Renewable, TerraForm Power makes money by selling the electricity it generates to end-users under long-term PPAs. Those contracts provide it with predictable cash flow, most of which (its payout ratio typically ranges between 80% to 85%) it returns to investors via a high-yield dividend. The company reinvests the remaining cash flow on high-return projects that expand its renewable power generating capacity. For example, it has three projects under way to upgrade some of its existing wind farms by installing newer, larger turbines that it hopes to complete by 2021. These investments would boost the power output at those locations by 25% to 30% at a 40% discount to the cost of building new wind farms. That enables TerraForm to boost its per-share earnings without making a substantial investment.

Aside from a similar business model, another reason TerraForm Power has so much in common with Brookfield Renewable is that they have the same parent in Brookfield Asset Management (NYSE: BAM) . Brookfield Asset and Brookfield Renewable joined forces in 2017 to take control of TerraForm Power after its former parent went bankrupt. They've since helped TerraForm get its financials back on solid ground while improving its operational focus and reducing costs. These factors have helped boost the profitability of TerraForm's legacy assets while giving it the financial flexibility to acquire new ones.

TerraForm made two major acquisitions in the first two years since Brookfield took control. Those transactions will provide the company with enough power to increase its dividend at a 5% to 8% annual rate through 2022. One of the main drivers of this growth is TerraForm's ability to improve the profitability of the assets it acquired by reducing costs.

Like many renewable energy companies, TerraForm Power has struggled to create value for investors in the past. Before Brookfield took over, the company's total return was a negative 50%. Those value-destroying ways, however, have changed since it began implementing Brookfield's game plan. In the first 22 months after Brookfield took control, TerraForm generated a nearly 44% total return, which obliterated the S&P 500's 17% total return over that timeframe.

While the Brookfield-led turnaround has been highly successful, TerraForm Power is still dealing with some of the lingering effects of its former parent. The biggest concern is its balance sheet, which remains loaded with debt. Because of that, the company's credit rating is below investment grade , which makes it harder and more expensive to borrow money. The company is working to address that issue by selling noncore assets and boosting its profitability.

As TerraForm's financial profile improves, it will enhance the company's ability to grow cash flow per share. That will increase the probability of achieving its dividend growth plan. Its new focus on creating shareholder value should give it the power to continue to outperform.

Regardless of its promise, the renewable energy sector has burned investors in the past due to intense competition and aggressive growth. Many companies have struggled to make money, with some having to declare bankruptcy.

The sector, however, is beginning to learn from those growing pains as well as from the companies that succeeded where others failed. Because of that, the renewable energy industry appears to have brighter days ahead, especially as climate change concerns heat up. While many companies could prosper in the coming years, these four have a long-term growth strategy aimed at increasing their earnings per share. That improves the probability that they can create value for shareholders, which makes them the best stocks in the sector to buy in the renewable energy sector.

At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the DPZ options chain for the new October 11th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.

Because the $225.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 55%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.31% return on the cash commitment, or 41.41% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost .

Considering the fact that the $230.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

On our website under the contract detail page for this contract , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

2019-09-03 07:44:00,"  Diageo plc DEO  stock has been resilient in a tough industry, courtesy of strong fundamentals, continuous innovation and focus on expansion. The company remains focused on expanding the fastest-growing premium spirits brands by resource optimization, which should drive growth and boost shareholder value.  makeArticleAd();  These actions largely fueled its results in recent years. The company reported strong results in fiscal 2019, wherein sales and earnings improved year over year. Earnings gained from strong organic operating profit growth, lower finance charges, positive impact of share buybacks and favorable currency. Meanwhile, the top-line improvement was backed by solid organic growth, benefiting from broad-based sales gains across all regions and categories.    Backed by favorable trends and ongoing plans, shares of the London-based company have advanced 22.8% in the past year compared with the industry  's growth of 5.7%.        Let's delve deeper and find out reasons behind the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock's outperformance.   Factors Aiding Stock Growth    Diageo continuously explores opportunities to expand geographically through acquisitions to further strengthen its exposure in the fast-growing categories. In sync with this strategy, the company increased its shareholding in Shui Jing Fang from 40% to just over 63% in fiscal 2019. This enhanced its presence in the premium Baijiu segment. Further, the company acquired the fastest-growing premium tequila brand in the United States, Casamigos, in August 2017, which boosted its market share in the tequila category.    Further, the company enhanced its portfolio with the acquisition of 26% stake in India's leading brewer, United Spirits Limited (in July 2014) and the premium brand, De Leon Comb Wine & Spirits (in fiscal 2014). Additionally, Diageo's distribution deal with Minnesota-based broker, United Brokerage, Inc., in 2013 solidifies its position in traditional markets.    Meanwhile, the company has been divesting assets to enhance its portfolio - including the recent divestiture of 19 brands to Sazerac. This divestiture will enable Diageo to focus on the premium and above-premium brands, with stronger growth and profit opportunities.    Concurrently, the company, like most other multinationals, is turning its attention to the emerging markets. It is the leading international spirits company in the emerging markets of Africa, Latin America and Asia. Moreover, Diageo caters to the local tastes of the regions. Its products like Johnnie Walker Blue Label bottle, which was designed through a series of exclusive private tasting in China, India, Thailand, Vietnam, Brazil and Mexico with local cultural relevance, testify this strategy.    Moreover, the acquisition of United Spirits extended its reach to one of the most populous countries, with growing middle-class population and beer consumption trends. With the opening of the first Johnnie Walker House in Seoul in October 2013, Diageo was able to boost sales in Korea.    We believe the company's expansion and innovation efforts along with robust organic growth trend instill confidence in reaching its medium-term targets. Notably, its organic operating margin expanded 83 basis points (bps) in fiscal 2019, marking a 198-bps organic operating margin expansion over the last three years. This expansion was above the company's long-term organic operating margin guidance of 175-bps improvement from fiscal 2017 through 2019.    Backed by the better-than-expected performance over the last three years, Diageo reiterated its medium-term guidance for the period between fiscal 2020 and 2022, which was announced in May 2019. The company continues to expect organic net sales growth in a mid-single digit between fiscal 2020 and 2022. Further, it expects to sustainably grow organic operating profit by 5-7%, suggesting growth of about 1% ahead of net sales.   Wrapping Up    Though the aforementioned factors keep us optimistic about the stock's potential, there remain some hurdles in its growth path. The most prominent among these is the persistent pressure from cost inflation and higher marketing expenses.    Marketing spends increased 8% in fiscal 2019, reflecting a 22-bps rise as a percentage of sales. This resulted from increased marketing investment in all regions, with the largest investments in US Spirits. Notably, the company's overall rate of marketing investments over the past two years has risen nearly 50 bps, owing to increased investments in marketing and new technology to build a sustainable growth platform.    Moreover, it expects an increase in marketing investment rate in fiscal 2020, focused on sustaining gains witnessed in the US Spirits segment through investments in new brands.    Additionally, while Diageo reiterated its medium-term view, it expects a slowdown in sales growth in fiscal 2020, owing to the lapping of several successful innovation launches in fiscal 2019. For fiscal 2020, the company anticipates net sales growth at the mid-point of 4-6%, whereas it recorded 5.8% gain in fiscal 2019.    Nonetheless, we believe that there is momentum left in the stock of this leading alcohol company as it has a long-term impressive earnings growth rate of 8.1% and a Growth Score  of A.   3 Better-Ranked Beverage Stocks    Carlsberg AS CABGY  has a long-term earnings growth rate of 5%.

","Diageo Gains on Innovation, Expansion Efforts: Can It Sustain? - Nasdaq.com",https://www.nasdaq.com/article/diageo-gains-on-innovation-expansion-efforts-can-it-sustain-cm1206544
2019-09-03 12:00:00,"Many high-growth e-commerce stocks recently tumbled on fears about the trade war and the inversion of the yield curve signaling a possible recession. But a handful of e-commerce stocks still have plenty of room to run in this difficult market. Today, three of our Motley Fool contributors will highlight JD.com (NASDAQ: JD) , Wayfair (NYSE: W) , and Splunk (NASDAQ: SPLK) -- companies that deserve to go higher despite the near-term macro challenges.

Leo Sun(JD.com): JD is the largest direct retailer and second largest e-commerce player in China after Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) . Unlike Alibaba, JD takes on inventories and runs its own fulfillment and logistics services. That business model is more capital-intensive than Alibaba's, but it's better shielded from counterfeit products.

Image source: Getty Images.

JD seemed to be in deep trouble last year, as its growth accelerated, its costs rose, and it struggled to remain profitable. A rape allegation against CEO Richard Liu and the escalating trade war exacerbated the pain.

The criminal charges against Liu were eventually dropped, and JD's latest quarter indicates that the e-tailer has finally turned a corner . JD's second-quarter revenue rose 23% annually, marking its strongest growth in three quarters. It expects that momentum to continue with 20% to 24% growth in the third quarter.

Much of that growth was fueled by higher demand for higher-ticket items like electronics and home appliances -- indicating that consumer spending in China remains robust in the shadow of the trade war. JD's adjusted net profit also surged more than sevenfold as JD Logistics' gross margin hit the break-even point for the first time ever. JD is also providing logistics to other companies as a third-party service, which will diversify its revenue streams beyond its core commerce business.

It also expects to remain consistently profitable for the year with a net profit margin of 1.4% to 1.7%. That's a big improvement from previous years, and indicates that economies of scale are kicking in -- which will make it tough for smaller rivals to compete while staying profitable. Despite all that good news, JD still trades at less than one time this year's sales -- so it could rebound quickly if investors develop an appetite for Chinese stocks again.

Demitri Kalogeropoulos(Wayfair) : Home furnishings specialist Wayfair has seen its stock return to roughly market-return levels after having nearly doubled at one point in 2019. Not much about the business story has changed in that time, though, which means investors are simply getting a better deal today.

Sure, Wayfair is no closer to achieving profitability. Instead, net losses ballooned over the first half of the year and are expected to jump again in the hiring buildup before the key holiday season. But look closer and you'll see gathering evidence o f earnings strength. Advertising spending is falling as a percentage of sales, repeat-customer orders are hitting new highs, and Wayfair's active customer base is barreling toward 20 million shoppers.

CEO Niraj Shah and his team issued a conservative outlook  for the third quarter. That caution, plus spiking volatility in the broader market, helped push shares down in recent weeks despite the company reporting its fifth straight quarter of surprisingly strong growth in August. As a result, investors who believe management's target of robust profitability is achievable over the long term might want to buy shares of Wayfair as it lines up another year of market share gains.

Steve Symington(Splunk): I'll admit that Splunk isn't exactly a pure play in e-commerce. But it boasts more than 18,000 enterprise customers -- including 92 members of the Fortune 100 -- that use its industry leading operational-intelligence platform to create actionable insights from their unstructured machined data. So it should come as no surprise that Splunk helps many of them massively improve their e-commerce and customer-experience efforts.

Consider Domino's Pizza (NYSE: DPZ) , which Splunk says has long used its software ""to support its entire e-commerce environment."" That includes everything from digging into previously difficult-to-process log files and troubleshooting issues, to providing invaluable feedback to support the pizza chain's web developers and marketing teams.

Image source: Getty Images.

Lucky for investors today, Splunk shares recently pulled back hard even though the company absolutely smashed analysts' estimates for revenue and earnings in its most recent quarter, then raised its full-year revenue guidance. The culprit for its drop? Splunk also significantly lowered its full-year cash flow targets , citing its faster-than-expected shift away from perceptual licenses and toward a cloud-based, renewable-term license model.

But make no mistake: While the timing of Splunk's cash collections is being affected in the near term, investors should be applauding the momentum that its underlying business is showing. As Splunk's renewable cloud offerings continue to gain steam, it should mean higher gross margins and more predictable revenue streams over the long term.

For patient investors willing to buy now and watch that shift continue to play out, I think Splunk stock is currently one of the most compelling values the market has to offer.

2019-09-03 08:44:00,"  Univar Inc. UNVR  recently announced that it has been selected as BASF's exclusive authorized distributor for Lupragen amine catalysts in the United States.  makeArticleAd();  Univar is a pioneer in chemicals and raw materials for coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers (CASE) applications, which positions the company to represent these specialty products in the polyurethane markets.    Per Univar, the broad line of catalysts fits well with its complimentary product mix in the polyurethane space. The company's strong distribution network and technical capabilities will enable it to leverage these products to deliver the right solutions to their mutual customers.    Notably, BASF has more than 15 polyurethane amine catalysts in its product portfolio. It markets high-performance reaction accelerators under the brand, Lupragen. This includes extremely low-emission polyurethane catalysts. They are used to facilitate the reaction of the main components' polyol and isocyanate.    Univar's shares have tumbled 30.4% in the past year compared with the 42.4% decline recorded by the industry  .      In August, the company revised its adjusted EBITDA forecast considering lower-than-expected demand for chemicals and ingredients, higher-than-expected net cost synergies from Nexeo as well as outlook from many supplier partners. It now expects adjusted EBITDA between $725 million and $740 million compared with the previous view of $740 million and $760 million.    Univar is progressing well with the integration of Nexeo's chemical distribution customers, suppliers and support functions. The company now sees higher cost-saving synergies from Nexeo than what it had originally anticipated. It has raised guidance for annual net synergy from $100 million to $120 million (before tax). Univar expects to achieve $20 million in net synergies this year, higher than the initial expectations of $10 million.   Zacks Rank & Key Picks    Univar currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).    Some better-ranked stocks in the basic materials space are Kinross Gold Corporation KGC  , Alamos Gold Inc.

 Univar Inc. UNVR  recently announced that it has been selected as BASF's exclusive authorized distributor for Lupragen amine catalysts in the United States.  makeArticleAd();  Univar is a pioneer in chemicals and raw materials for coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers (CASE) applications, which positions the company to represent these specialty products in the polyurethane markets.    Per Univar, the broad line of catalysts fits well with its complimentary product mix in the polyurethane space. The company's strong distribution network and technical capabilities will enable it to leverage these products to deliver the right solutions to their mutual customers.    Notably, BASF has more than 15 polyurethane amine catalysts in its product portfolio. It markets high-performance reaction accelerators under the brand, Lupragen. This includes extremely low-emission polyurethane catalysts. They are used to facilitate the reaction of the main components' polyol and isocyanate.    Univar's shares have tumbled 30.4% in the past year compared with the 42.4% decline recorded by the industry  .

     In August, the company revised its adjusted EBITDA forecast considering lower-than-expected demand for chemicals and ingredients, higher-than-expected net cost synergies from Nexeo as well as outlook from many supplier partners. It now expects adjusted EBITDA between $725 million and $740 million compared with the previous view of $740 million and $760 million.    Univar is progressing well with the integration of Nexeo's chemical distribution customers, suppliers and support functions. The company now sees higher cost-saving synergies from Nexeo than what it had originally anticipated. It has raised guidance for annual net synergy from $100 million to $120 million (before tax). Univar expects to achieve $20 million in net synergies this year, higher than the initial expectations of $10 million.   Zacks Rank & Key Picks    Univar currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).    Some better-ranked stocks in the basic materials space are Kinross Gold Corporation KGC  , Alamos Gold Inc.

",Univar (UNVR) to Distribute BASF's Lupragen in the U.S. - Nasdaq.com,https://www.nasdaq.com/article/univar-unvr-to-distribute-basfs-lupragen-in-the-us-cm1206628
2019-09-03 12:55:00,"Shares of Emergent BioSolutions (NYSE: EBS) are up 14% at 11:55 a.m. EDT after the bioterrorism expert was awarded a contract by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to deliver approximately $2 billion worth of smallpox vaccine ACAM2000 to the U.S. strategic national stockpile over the next 10 years.

The contract will start with $170 million in the first year, with the government having nine additional option years.

Having contracts with the government is a substantial advantage Emergent BioSolutions has compared to other biotech companies when it comes to predicting sales. But between contracts, there's increased risk that the sides might not come to terms for a new contract, so some of today's move just comes from relief that there's a contract in place.

But investors are equally excited about the size of the contract. The previous 10-year contract, which was negotiated by Acambis (a vaccine maker acquired by partner Sanofi (NASDAQ: SNY) ) was only for $425 million, with about a third of that attributable to license maintenance activities.

Emergent BioSolutions bought ACAM2000 plus a manufacturing plant and a lease on a facility that fills vials with drugs from Sanofi for $125 million in 2017. It seems likely the new contract will more than pay for the acquisition.

The number of doses to be delivered wasn't disclosed, but presumably the government is getting a bulk discount over the previous contract. Fortunately, gross margins are likely high enough on the product to offer a discount and still make a substantially higher profit.

Emergent BioSolutions has been manufacturing ACAM2000 during the break between contracts, so it has a warehouse full of the drug ready to be delivered to the strategic national stockpile. The company said it plans to deliver a majority of the doses under the first year of the contract by the end of 2019, which will allow Emergent to reach its 2019 guidance .

2019-09-03 08:55:29,"August was a particularly volatile month for investors. With ongoing US-China trade tensions and recession signals from the bond market, it’s not surprising that the S&P 500 posted 11 moves of over 1%. What’s more worrying is that it is unlikely the volatility will abate anytime soon. The Cboe Volatility Index remains at elevated levels- and in any case, September is a notoriously difficult month for the markets.

So where does this leave investors? Well one option is to tune in to the Street and see which stocks analysts are recommending right now. Here we take a closer look at seven stocks, all with recent bullish calls from Goldman Sachs. Furthermore, as you will see, each of these stocks shows over 20% upside potential from current levels- meaning now could be a compelling time to buy in. Let’s take a closer look at which stocks are on Goldman’s buy list now:

Uber Technologies Inc (UBER)

Five-star Goldman Sachs analyst Heath Terry has a buy rating and $56 price target on ride-hailing giant Uber. From current levels that indicates impressive upside potential of 72%.

He clearly sees a buying opportunity from Uber’s current weakness. Indeed, the stock is currently trading at just $33- a far cry from its IPO price of $45 back in May. That’s with shares plunging 23% in August after Uber reported a huge net loss of $5.24 billion for Q219. Even without the ‘one-off’ hit of stock-based compensation, the loss still amounted to $1.3 billion- up around 30% from the first quarter.

“While there are considerable risks in ownership across the space given the intense competition, regulatory issues, and operating pressures, we continue to believe the risk/reward in owning the leader in this space is favorable and we remain Buy-rated” Terry told investors. Plus Terry did note that Uber’s core ride-hailing business generated $12.19 billion in Q2 gross bookings, beating the estimated $12.11 billion.

In total, UBER still earns a ‘Strong Buy’ Street consensus. In the last three months the stock has scored 20 buy ratings and 6 hold ratings. At $55 the average analyst price target falls marginally below Terry’s own estimate, and suggests upside potential of 68%.

Micron Technology Inc (MU)

Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney recently carried out a slew of tech stock upgrades. And one of the key stocks on his upgrade list was chip maker Micron.

“We are now more positive on global memory stocks. … We believe that Micron’s stock will trade more on memory pricing trends and intermediate term EPS expectations than FY20 earnings,” the three-star analyst said in a note to clients last month. He has a $56 price target on MU, suggesting 24% upside potential lies ahead. Bear in mind that’s with shares already soaring 43% year-to-date.

“We now believe that inventory at the memory companies … is being depleted faster than we previously expected. In addition, we continue to expect the underlying rate of production to fall below longer-term demand growth in 2020,” added Delaney.

Overall, MU shows a relatively optimistic take from the Street. That’s with a Moderate Buy consensus based on 13 buy ratings, 6 hold ratings and 2 sell ratings. However the average price target of $48 only suggests 6% upside potential from current levels.

CommScope Holding Co Inc (COMM)

CommScope Holding helps design, build, and manage wired and wireless networks around the world. It’s another stock that Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney has recently boosted to buy.

“While we were incrementally positive on the stock after the company reported a 1.17 BTB for 1Q16 with strength in both fiber and mobile, CommScope announced a small cell win on May 2nd that gives us increased confidence on its ability to be successful in this key market for 5G,” the analyst explained. He now has a buy rating on COMM with a $19 price target. Given that the stock trades at just $11, this indicates upside potential of 77%.

Delaney also pointed out that the “small cell win implies CommScope is better positioned than we had thought in the $2–$2.5 billion small cell market.”

Encouragingly, CommScope also earns a ‘Strong Buy’ consensus from the Street. In the last three months, 8 analysts have published buy ratings on the stock with two analysts staying sidelined. The average analyst price target works out at $20.25.

Amazon.com Inc (AMZN)

Amazon is another top stock on Heath Terry’s buy list. Year-to-date, the stock has climbed 18%, and Terry sees a further 35% upside for the months ahead.

“We continue to believe AMZN represents the best risk/reward in Internet given the relatively early-stage shift of workloads to the cloud, the transition of traditional retail online, and share gains in its advertising business, the long-term benefits of each we believe the market continues to underestimate for Amazon…” the analyst tells investors.

Even though the company released mixed Q2 earnings, Terry remains optimistic. He points out that Q2 revenue spiked 20% year-over-year, with North America retail growth driving the revenue outperformance. And despite the surprising deceleration in Amazon’s cloud service AWS, the shift to the cloud remains relatively early-stage and overall revenue growth is still accelerating, says the analyst.

Indeed, the Street is now unanimously positive on AMZN stock. In the last three months, Amazon has received 29 consecutive buy ratings. Plus the average analyst price target of $2,286 indicates 29% upside potential.

Twitter Inc (TWTR)

President Trump’s favorite social media platform, Twitter has just posted strong Q2 results. Alongside stable revenue growth, TWTR is now looking at sequential quarters of impressive engagement growth trends. In particular, analyst Heath Terry noted that Twitter’s monetizable DAU growth accelerated to 14% in Q2 thanks to an ongoing slate of product improvements.

“Twitter continues to build on ‘Information Quality’ efforts… by moderating unwanted behavior, spam accounts, and low quality tweets through product innovation, acquisition, or more active removal of violating accounts and developer applications,” Terry wrote. “Our ad partner checks suggest that these efforts have generally been well received by advertisers and … are contributing to incremental ad dollars flowing onto the platform.”

“Twitter continues to focus on the relevance of its product for its core user base, particularly on Video where the company highlighted in the first quarter improved click through rates,” he added. As a result, the analyst reiterated his TWTR buy rating with a $52 price target (22% upside potential).

The Street is notably more restrained on its Twitter outlook. With only 4 buy ratings, 17 hold ratings and even 3 sell ratings, the consensus is a clear Hold. What’s more, with shares already up 48% year-to-date, the average analyst price target of $41 now falls 3% below the current share price.

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA)

Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba scores 100% buy ratings from the Street. No less than 15 analysts have published back-to-back buy ratings on Alibaba. Meanwhile the average analyst price target indicates 28% upside potential from current levels.

One of the analysts singing the stock’s praises is Goldman Sachs’ Piyush Mubayi. This four-star analyst has a $236 price target on BABA, for upside potential of 35%. And following the company’s FQ1 earnings beat, Mubayi reiterated his Conviction Buy rating on shares. “We remain impressed with Alibaba’s overall leverage to China consumption growth given its strategy, positioning, ability to build new businesses (such as new retail) and its execution,” Mubayi said in a note to clients. “We expect Alibaba to continue to invest for future growth on multiple fronts.”

“In our view, the continuous investment in cloud technology demonstrates Alibaba’s determination to solidify its leading position in the industry and take up more market share in the future,” he continued. “We believe Ant Financial will continue to be the ‘enabler’ of Alibaba’s New Retail strategy and help the company navigate the globalization road map.” For the fiscal first quarter, revenue growth decelerated 10pts, but still reflected a robust 40%+ Y/Y growth, while EBITDA accelerated 5pts to 34% Y/Y.

Stitch Fix Inc (SFIX)

Online personal styling service Stitch Fix has a radical data-driven way of selling clothes. It sends clients direct shipments of apparel that have been specially selected through the combination of data science and personal stylists. So far this strategy appears to be paying off. The company has just reported nine straight quarter of mid- to high- 20s% year-over-year revenue growth. And that’s on a $1.6 billion revenue run rate.

“We upgrade SFIX to Buy from Neutral as we see more compelling risk/reward in the company’s ability to lean into its existing core customer base while also efficiently expanding to new categories and geographies (UK)” commented Terry on July 22. He sees significant opportunities “for further outperformance,” boosted by the increase in retail store closures (particularly in apparel).

Along with his new buy rating comes a $38 price target- suggesting shares can explode by 99%. Shares have dropped recently on concerns about Amazon’s rival Prime service, but analysts are remaining on-side. “We believe the company’s data science capabilities and brand access are key competitive advantages versus Amazon and other emerging players” said Stifel Nicolaus’ Scott Devitt. This Top 100 analyst has also just upgraded SFIX to buy with a $35 price target.

Overall the Street has a cautiously optimistic take on SFIX. Its Moderate Buy consensus is based on 4 recent buy ratings vs 3 hold ratings. That’s with an average analyst price target of $37.

COLOMBO, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Sri Lanka could overshoot its budget deficit target by much as 100 basis points this year, pushing its fiscal deficit to its highest in three years, as spending cuts have failed to offset shortfalls in revenues, three finance ministry officials said.

Tight monetary and fiscal policies coupled with the impact of Easter Sunday bomb attacks have dented investor confidence in the island nation and led to sluggish growth, which is this year expected to be the lowest in nearly two decades.

The finance ministry official, along with two other sources, said the revenue miss could push the fiscal deficit up to 5.4% in 2019, from the 4.4% target set by the government, in line with conditions tied to an International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan.

The three government sources asked not to be identified as they are not authorized to discuss the matter with media.

The jump in the fiscal deficit could strain Sri Lanka's deal with the IMF, which early this year extended a $1.5 billion loan facility for an extra year.

As part of the loan deal, Sri Lanka had agreed to bring its deficit target to 3.5% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2020. 

""We may have to discuss the latest situation with the IMF,"" said one of the officials. ""There is a clear reason for missing the (budget deficit) target.""

The tourism sector, the third-largest source of foreign currency for Sri Lanka, has been badly hit by the April 21 attacks by Islamist militants that killed more than 250 people. 

The senior finance ministry official said the ability to cut spending any further has been constrained by the fact that the country is set to hold a presidential election later this year.

""We really want to cut spending more than 20%. But there has been a lot of opposition from the government for further spending cuts, given it's an election year,"" the official said.

2019-09-03 14:57:00,"  This article was     first published by MyWallSt.   Which 2 pot stocks will beat the market? Find out in our       free guide!   In 2018, we saw 190 companies become listed on U.S. exchanges,   and 2019 is proving to be no different. This year has been a   hectic one for IPOs, with companies such as   Uber    (NYSE: UBER) ,   Pinterest    (NYSE: PINS) ,   Beyond Meat    (NASDAQ: BYND) , and   Slack    (NYSE: WORK) going public so far. The year is far from over   though, with many companies potentially going public in the next   four months.   Image source: Unsplash.makeArticleAd();  These three companies plan on going public soon and should   definitely be watched by investors.  1. Airbnb  Airbnb has taken the hotel and hospitality industry by storm.   Launched over 10 years ago, it now hosts over 2 million people a   night, for a total of 400 million people since the company was   founded in 2008. Airbnb is available in 191 countries, 100,000   cities, and offers roughly 6 million different places to stay.   Thanks to its cheap and easy-to-use service, Airbnb has become a   household name. In 2018, Airbnb saw a 62.5% increase in guest arrivals, with   Mexico City and Beijing up 79% and 91%, respectively. Even though   Airbnb is a privately traded company, reports have shown that in   2018's third quarter, Airbnb turned over $1 billion in revenue,   with some analysts expecting revenue to hit $8.5 billion by 2021.   A portion of this growth comes from Airbnb's more recent venture,   Airbnb Experiences. Launched over three years ago, this service   offers over 5,000 experiences in 60 cities across the globe,   growing 2,500% in 2018. Unlike many companies that have gone   public recently, Airbnb has also reported a positive earnings   before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA)   for the past two years. This has been aided by the experiences   segment, with some experiences earning more than $200,000   each. The growth of Airbnb has not gone unnoticed by traditional   competitors such as   Booking.com    (NASDAQ: BKNG) and   TripAdvisor    (NASDAQ: TRIP) , which now face a significant threat. A recent   survey from Morgan Stanley indicated that 42% of Airbnb users had   replaced a traditional hotel service with Airbnb's digital   service. This is no surprise, with hotels costing 6% to 17% more   than an Airbnb. While Airbnb has not yet announced when it intends to go   public, an IPO is certainly on the table for the end of 2019. In   a statement, co-founder Nathan Blecharczyk said: ""We have already   said that we are taking the steps to be ready to go public in   2019. That doesn't mean we will go public in 2019.""  2. Instacart  Apoorva Mehta, CEO of the popular grocery delivery company   Instacart, said at the start of this year that ""   an IPO is definitely on the horizon    ."" Founded by a former Amazon employee, Instacart reached an $8   billion valuation in 2018 after raising $271 million in funding   last November. While online grocery shopping makes up only 10% of consumer   spending, the industry has seen significant growth in recent   times. From 2016 to 2018, the online grocery market doubled, and   it is expected that between 2018 and 2023, the market will   quadruple, with 1 in 5 Americans predicted to buy groceries   online. Although Instacart's revenue and profitability are not   publicly disclosed, the company appears to be growing. Founded in   2012, Instacart now serves over 15,000 grocery stores in 4,000   cities and has formed partnerships with companies such as   Kroger    , ALDI, Sam's Club, and   Walmart    Canada. As of 2018, Instacart had over 30,000 customers and has   been investing heavily in research and development, announcing   the opening of a second R&D headquarters in Toronto,   Canada. In an industry as explosive as online grocery shopping,   Instacart faces great competition from companies such as Walmart,   Amazon    , and   Target    . These popular companies have already carved out a name in the   space, and it is apparent that customers will use their delivery   service first. According to a study by Second Measure, Walmart --   one of Instacart's largest competitors -- has 62% more online   shoppers. Amazon, through Prime Now and Amazon Fresh, currently   makes up 30% of all online grocery shopping, and Target's Shipt   saw 92% more orders in January 2019 compared to January 2018.   Despite such intense competition, Instacart may have a   significant role to play, providing smaller, regional retailers   with logistical expertise and e-commerce options.  3. SmileDirectClub  SmileDirectClub is another company that will definitely go   public in 2019 after filing a form S-1 in August. SmileDirectClub   provides clear teeth aligners, a replacement for traditional   train-track-style braces. Unlike their main competitor,   Align Technology    's (NASDAQ: ALGN) Invisalign, however, SmileDirectClub's aligners   can be fitted either at home or in ""SmileShop"" stores, and thus   cost roughly 60% less than Invisalign. This affordability and ease of use has made them a significant   threat to Align, which actually owns 19% of SmileDirectClub.   Despite being part owners, their relationship has not always been   healthy, with Align forced to close its physical stores due to a   non-compete violation with SmileDirectClub. A deal struck last   year between SmileDirectClub and   CVS    will see the products offered in hundreds of CVS stores across   the U.S. This partnership will increase customer awareness for   SmileDirectClub and should prove to be a big success against   competitors. SmileDirectClub recently received a valuation of $3.2 billion   and has had over 300,000 customers since its founding in 2014.   With the global orthodontics market set to reach $2.6 billion in   2023, it is no surprise that SmileDirectClub has a lot of room to   grow, especially at a time when consumers demand things cheaply   and efficiently. In 2018, SmileDirectClub's revenue grew 184% to   $398 million. Although SmileDirectClub has a unique position in the market   and is seeing huge revenue growth, investors should be wary as   dentists have taken issue with its product. Dentists have filed   complaints in 36 states as they believe the process of teeth   straightening is an important medical procedure and requires   numerous checkups. Government intervention in the dental industry   could prove to be dangerous for SmileDirectClub's business model.   Nevertheless, this soon-to-be-public company is seeing impressive   growth, and investors should definitely keep a close eye.

This year has been a   hectic one for IPOs, with companies such as   Uber    (NYSE: UBER) ,   Pinterest    (NYSE: PINS) ,   Beyond Meat    (NASDAQ: BYND) , and   Slack    (NYSE: WORK) going public so far. The year is far from over   though, with many companies potentially going public in the next   four months.

These three companies plan on going public soon and should   definitely be watched by investors.

Airbnb has taken the hotel and hospitality industry by storm.   Launched over 10 years ago, it now hosts over 2 million people a   night, for a total of 400 million people since the company was   founded in 2008. Airbnb is available in 191 countries, 100,000   cities, and offers roughly 6 million different places to stay.   Thanks to its cheap and easy-to-use service, Airbnb has become a   household name.

In 2018, Airbnb saw a 62.5% increase in guest arrivals, with   Mexico City and Beijing up 79% and 91%, respectively. Even though   Airbnb is a privately traded company, reports have shown that in   2018's third quarter, Airbnb turned over $1 billion in revenue,   with some analysts expecting revenue to hit $8.5 billion by 2021.   A portion of this growth comes from Airbnb's more recent venture,   Airbnb Experiences. Launched over three years ago, this service   offers over 5,000 experiences in 60 cities across the globe,   growing 2,500% in 2018. Unlike many companies that have gone   public recently, Airbnb has also reported a positive earnings   before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA)   for the past two years. This has been aided by the experiences   segment, with some experiences earning more than $200,000   each.

The growth of Airbnb has not gone unnoticed by traditional   competitors such as   Booking.com    (NASDAQ: BKNG) and   TripAdvisor    (NASDAQ: TRIP) , which now face a significant threat. A recent   survey from Morgan Stanley indicated that 42% of Airbnb users had   replaced a traditional hotel service with Airbnb's digital   service. This is no surprise, with hotels costing 6% to 17% more   than an Airbnb.

While Airbnb has not yet announced when it intends to go   public, an IPO is certainly on the table for the end of 2019. In   a statement, co-founder Nathan Blecharczyk said: ""We have already   said that we are taking the steps to be ready to go public in   2019. That doesn't mean we will go public in 2019.""

Apoorva Mehta, CEO of the popular grocery delivery company   Instacart, said at the start of this year that ""   an IPO is definitely on the horizon    ."" Founded by a former Amazon employee, Instacart reached an $8   billion valuation in 2018 after raising $271 million in funding   last November.

While online grocery shopping makes up only 10% of consumer   spending, the industry has seen significant growth in recent   times. From 2016 to 2018, the online grocery market doubled, and   it is expected that between 2018 and 2023, the market will   quadruple, with 1 in 5 Americans predicted to buy groceries   online.

Although Instacart's revenue and profitability are not   publicly disclosed, the company appears to be growing. Founded in   2012, Instacart now serves over 15,000 grocery stores in 4,000   cities and has formed partnerships with companies such as   Kroger    , ALDI, Sam's Club, and   Walmart    Canada. As of 2018, Instacart had over 30,000 customers and has   been investing heavily in research and development, announcing   the opening of a second R&D headquarters in Toronto,   Canada.

In an industry as explosive as online grocery shopping,   Instacart faces great competition from companies such as Walmart,   Amazon    , and   Target    . These popular companies have already carved out a name in the   space, and it is apparent that customers will use their delivery   service first. According to a study by Second Measure, Walmart --   one of Instacart's largest competitors -- has 62% more online   shoppers. Amazon, through Prime Now and Amazon Fresh, currently   makes up 30% of all online grocery shopping, and Target's Shipt   saw 92% more orders in January 2019 compared to January 2018.   Despite such intense competition, Instacart may have a   significant role to play, providing smaller, regional retailers   with logistical expertise and e-commerce options.

SmileDirectClub is another company that will definitely go   public in 2019 after filing a form S-1 in August. SmileDirectClub   provides clear teeth aligners, a replacement for traditional   train-track-style braces. Unlike their main competitor,   Align Technology    's (NASDAQ: ALGN) Invisalign, however, SmileDirectClub's aligners   can be fitted either at home or in ""SmileShop"" stores, and thus   cost roughly 60% less than Invisalign.

This affordability and ease of use has made them a significant   threat to Align, which actually owns 19% of SmileDirectClub.   Despite being part owners, their relationship has not always been   healthy, with Align forced to close its physical stores due to a   non-compete violation with SmileDirectClub. A deal struck last   year between SmileDirectClub and   CVS    will see the products offered in hundreds of CVS stores across   the U.S. This partnership will increase customer awareness for   SmileDirectClub and should prove to be a big success against   competitors.

SmileDirectClub recently received a valuation of $3.2 billion   and has had over 300,000 customers since its founding in 2014.   With the global orthodontics market set to reach $2.6 billion in   2023, it is no surprise that SmileDirectClub has a lot of room to   grow, especially at a time when consumers demand things cheaply   and efficiently. In 2018, SmileDirectClub's revenue grew 184% to   $398 million.

Although SmileDirectClub has a unique position in the market   and is seeing huge revenue growth, investors should be wary as   dentists have taken issue with its product. Dentists have filed   complaints in 36 states as they believe the process of teeth   straightening is an important medical procedure and requires   numerous checkups. Government intervention in the dental industry   could prove to be dangerous for SmileDirectClub's business model.   Nevertheless, this soon-to-be-public company is seeing impressive   growth, and investors should definitely keep a close eye.

2019-09-03 11:00:00," Shares of Acorda Therapeutics, Inc. ACOR  have declined sharply in the past three months. The stock has plunged 65.1%, significantly wider than the industry's  decrease of 3.5%.    Acorda's lead multiple sclerosis (MS) drug Ampyra is facing generic competition in the United States. Notably, during the first half of 2019, sales of Ampyra tanked significantly year over year due to generic launches. Last September, Ampyra lost its exclusivity as generics entered the market including Mylan's MYL  authorized generic version. However, Ampyra's sales were higher than the company's internal projections in the second quarter because sales erosion due to generic launches was less severe. Meanwhile, the company still believes that Ampyra sales will see a sharp fall moving ahead. Acorda is heavily dependent on Ampyra to draw major part of its revenues and losing out on the same in the upcoming quarters will thus be a major blow to the company's top line. Meanwhile, Acorda's Parkinson disease (PD) drug Inbrija, launched in February this year, generated sales of $3 million in the second quarter, reflecting a significant sequential increase. The company believes that Inbrija sales will pick up in the future quarters, having received an encouraging feedback from doctors as well as patients since its launch. Notably, last December, the FDA approved Inbrija. Following this nod, the product became the first and the only approved inhaled levodopa for treating OFF periods in patients suffering Parkinson's and receiving a carbidopa / levodopa regimen. In July 2019, the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) rendered a positive opinion recommending the approval of Inbrija in Europe. A final decision is expected by this year end. We would like to remind investors that the successful commercialization of Inbrija is imperative to Acorda's long-term growth, especially as generic competition looms large on Ampyra. Although Inbrija is off to a promising start, it still remains to be seen if the product can deliver the desired results and be a worthy replacement for Ampyra in the long run. Notably, more than 3,50,000 people in the United States are suffering OFF periods related to Parkinson's disease. Acorda estimates Inbrija's market opportunity to be more than $800 million in the United States. Although Inbrija is pretty new to the market, the drug's successful commercialization along with its sales uptick should help the stock recover in the days ahead.  Acorda Therapeutics, Inc.

NEW YORK, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The dollar was little changedon Tuesday against a basket of currencies, underpinned bysafe-haven demand on worries about U.S.-China trade tensions anda chaotic British exit from the European Union.

Initial strength that propelled the dollar to a more thantwo-year peak faded following a private report that showed theU.S. manufacturing sector in August recorded its first monthlycontraction since 2016. urn:newsml:reuters.com:*:nL2N25R073

""That's a reflection on what has been going on on the tradefront,"" said Don Ellenberger, head of multi-sector strategies atFederated Investors in Pittsburgh.

The steeper-than-expected decline in the factory activityindex of the Institute for Supply Management touched off a rallyin the U.S. bond market, sending benchmark 10-year yields US10YT=RR to their lowest levels since July 2016. urn:newsml:reuters.com:*:nL2N25U0O6

In late U.S. trading, the dollar index .DXY , which tracksthe greenback against versus six major currencies, was up 0.05%at 98.964. Earlier, it hit 99.37, its highest level since May2017.

The euro stabilized after tumbling to a 28-month low againstthe dollar earlier Tuesday as investors priced in deepernegative interest rates for longer in the euro zone.

The euro EUR=EBS was little changed at  $1.0966, afterhitting $1.0926 earlier, its lowest level since mid-May 2017. Abreak below the key $1.1000 level last week had sparked heaviersell-offs.

The dollar weakened against the yen JPY=EBS and the Swissfranc CHF=EBS in the aftermath of the disappointing ISMmanufacturing data. The greenback fell 0.2% to 106.045 yen anddecreased 0.3% to 0.98745 franc.

It's been a tough summer for Hexo (NYSE: HEXO ) shareholders. But for investors seeking exposure to the cannabis market, the price is nearly right for a less speculative investment.

I've said it before and it bears repeating, Hexo, along with competitors Aurora Cannabis (NYSE: ACB ), Canopy Growth (NYSE: CGC ) or a New Age Beverages (NASDAQ: NBEV ) face very real challenges despite the potential opportunity within the cannabis industry. Universally, the group is mired in losses as companies spend aggressively to gain market share. All the while, the opening up of new markets due to regulatory red tape remains much easier said than done.

It's a tough combination that's resulted in supply dwarfing demand and a business environment which will undoubtedly see casualties. In large part these difficult realities are why cannabis stocks have cratered and why Hexo stock has lost more than 50% over the past four months. But turning your back on HEXO could be a big mistake.

The fact remains that Hexo is well-positioned for success within the niche edibles and cannabis-infused beverages market. With a partner in beverage giant Molson Coors (NYSE: TAP ), Hexo maintains resources ranging from financial support to Molson's marketing, distribution and operational expertise.

Hexo stock's partnership isn't a guarantee of survival. For the reasons already stressed, it's simply too early to know if Hexo will ever be a viable business. But it would be unfair to not appreciate Molson Coors as a significant advantage as Hexo looks to build its brand in this up-and-coming, but still speculative market.

Hexo's technical wherewithal relative to its peers also makes it a standout in the cannabis space. Obviously, the deep corrective move over the past few months hasn't been pleasant. However, HEXO stock is technically unique. Shares remain in an uptrend supported by it's late April higher high pattern and today's higher low relative to its December bottom.

With a small double bottom having formed on the weekly chart, HEXO is nearly ready for investors to buy. With this second pivot low finishing in a weekly hammer as of Friday's close, shares are in position to buy on confirmation of this reversal candlestick.

My recommendation for buying Hexo stock would be to buy shares above $4.18. That's 8 cents through the high of the weekly hammer. This approach gives up a few pennies of profit in return for trying to purchase HEXO on sustainable momentum to avoid the possibility of a weaker buy signal in Hexo stock price that's doomed to fail.

Similarly, and to contain risk, I'd place an initial stop at $3.63 and 8 cents beneath the pattern low. This exit looks to evade being an easy target for a bear raid hitting picture perfect stops at $3.70.

In exchange for the position risk of 65 cents, I'd take partial profits in between $5.00-$5.15. The targeted area is slightly above the double bottom's July high and may draw in fresh buying interest. But with no guarantees and profits approaching 1.5x the risk, this spot reasonably makes sense off and on the price chart.

2019-09-03 11:01:00,"By Kate Duguid

NEW YORK, Sept 3 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields fell on Tuesday morning, with the benchmark 10-year yield at its lowest since July 2016, after manufacturing data showed the U.S. factory sector contracted for the first time since 2016 amid worries about a weakening global economy and trade tensions between China and the United States.

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity decreased in August to 49.1, the lowest since January 2016. This compared with a figure of 51.2 in July. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 51.1 for August. 

Across maturities, yields fell. The 10-year yield  fell as low as 1.4370% and was last down 6.2 basis points to 1.4439%. The two-year yield  was 0.58 basis points lower to 1.4500%. The fall was greater in shorter-dated maturities, steepening the yield curve slightly, though it remained inverted.

""Employment was softer at 47.4 vs. 51.7 July - if there was any question whether or not the trade war was hurting manufacturing sentiment, today's release cleared that up with the insightful observation that ""Comments from the panel reflect a notable decrease in business confidence,"""" said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York.

Looking at the spread between ISM ""New orders"" minus ""Inventories,"" Lyngen said, ""While not definitive, there is a clear correlation between a negative spread and an economic recession. The logic holds that if inventories are building faster than new orders are coming in, there is a problem on the horizon.""

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that trade talks between the United States and China were going well, but warned he would be ""tougher"" in negotiations if the discussions drag on until his second term. 

Other data on Tuesday showed construction spending barely rising in July. Data on consumer spending had suggested that while the economy was slowing, it was not losing momentum as rapidly as financial markets were flagging.

The two-year yield was at its lowest since September 2017.",Ten-year yield at lowest since 2016 after U.S. manufacturing shrinks - Nasdaq.com,https://www.nasdaq.com/article/tenyear-yield-at-lowest-since-2016-after-us-manufacturing-shrinks-20190903-00892
2019-09-03 10:04:00," Silver is on a roll this year, with prices trending above $18 an ounce - levels last seen in 2017. The metal has gained 11.26% over the past month, outshining gold's 5.08%. The rally can be attributed to a dovish fed, safe haven demand triggered by latest tit-for-tat tariffs by the United States and China, and concerns over the global economic outlook.  makeArticleAd();  On Aug 23, China hiked tariff on U.S. goods worth $75 billion and announced it will raise import duties on U.S.-made autos and auto parts. In retaliation, President Trump raised the tariffs to 30% from 25% on Chinese goods worth $250 billion and 15% from 10% on other products worth $300 billion.    Stock markets took a dive on apprehensions that elevated tariffs will add to global economic weakness. The 10-year Treasury note yield declined below 2%.    Sales of new U.S homes witnessed a drop of 12.8% to 635,000 new homes in July from June's revised rate of 728,000 and projected figure of 647,000 units.  So far this year, new home sales have risen just 4.1%, reflecting ongoing weakness in the housing market despite the reduction in mortgage rates.    Another factor that has been working in favor of silver lately is subdued demand for gold in India owing to  gold prices  at 6-year high. Most consumers sold their physical gold holdings to capitalize on the higher gold prices and opted for silver. All these developments led to silver gaining 17.8% so far this year.   What Next For Silver?    Silver's unrivaled characteristics make it indispensable for many industrial products. In fact, industrial applications account for roughly 60% of the global silver consumption. Growing industrial activity will sustain silver demand. India is expected to be one of the largest silver consumers in 2019. Notably, silver imports rose 35% year over year to around 225 million ounces in 2018 in the country. Demand in jewelry fabrication, which accounts for approximately one-fifth of total silver demand, is also expected to witness solid growth in 2019.    However, silver mine production fell 2% in 2018 - the third consecutive year-on-year drop and is anticipated to decline 2% in 2019.  This can be attributed to the absence of development of new projects, declining ore grades and depleting reserves. Consequently, a potential silver deficit is imminent, which in turn sets the stage for higher  silver prices  in the long haul.   Silver Industry Performance         The Mining - Silver  industry has rallied 18.0% so far this year compared with the S&P 500's growth of 15.3%. Going by the forward 12 months EV/EBITDA multiple (a preferred valuation metric for mining companies that have high capital expenditures), the silver mining industry has a multiple of 8.7, lower than the S&P 500's multiple of 11.6.        The group's Zacks Industry Rank  , which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright prospects in the near term. The Zacks Mining- Silver Industry, which is a 14-stock group within the broader Zacks Basic Materials  Sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #76, which places it at the top 30% of 256 Zacks industries.

2019-09-03 08:28:00," Markets were extremely volatile in August as investors were wary about the escalating tariff dispute between Washington and Beijing. As we step into September, trade tensions and fears of recession continue to bother the Wall Street. In such a situation, investors are dumping stocks to park money in traditional safe-haven securities, leading to a year-to-date surge in gold price of roughly 19%.  Escalating US-Sino Tariff Battle  Since Sep 1, the Trump administration has imposed a 15% tariff on roughly $112 billion of imports from Beijing. America is set to impose a 15% tariff on a separate batch of Chinese goods of roughly $160 billion in value from Dec 15 onward. Beijing retaliated and started imposing additional tariffs on several imports from the United States to initiate its plan to impose extra duty on $75 billion of American goods. Of the total of 5,078 U.S. products that Beijing imports, 1,717 items have seen additional tariffs of 5% and 10%, respectively. The rest of the countermeasures will be put into effect on Dec 15.  Trade Dispute Threatens US Economy  The latest round of tariff by the Trump administration on billions of dollar worth of Chinese imports has raised prices of consumer goods. Americans now need to pay higher prices for more than 66% of products that Washington imports from Beijing. With higher retail prices for many products, the administration's latest stance is likely to impede America's economic growth since it is primarily driven by consumer spending. AllianceBernstein, global asset management firm, believes that if the tariff dispute intensifies, businesses in America will curtail their hiring programs. This is likely to further hurt domestic consumer spending, thereby posing additional risks to the U.S. economy.  Time to Pick Safe-Haven Stocks  September is going to be challenging since there are reasons for the stock market to remain volatile. Hence, it would probably be safe for many investors to pick gold stocks which are considered to be safe haven as they can maintain or increase in value during market turmoil. We have employed our proprietary stock screener  to shortlist potential gold stocks carrying either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see   the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here   . Headquartered in Toronto, Canada, Kirkland Lake Gold Ltd KL  is a leading explorer and producer of gold. The company has an average positive earnings surprise of 6.1% for the past four quarters. Moreover, over the past 30 days, the #1 Ranked stock has been witnessing positive earnings estimate revisions for 2019 and 2020, respectively.  AngloGold Ashanti Limited AU  , headquartered in Johannesburg, South Africa, is among the largest gold miners in the world. For 2019 and 2020, the Zacks #1 Ranked stock is likely to see earnings growth of 158.5% and 60.6%, respectively. Headquartered in Toronto, Canada, Barrick Gold Corporation GOLD  is a leading explorer of gold with 61.5% interest in the prolific Nevada Gold Mines. The company, with a Zacks Rank of 2, is likely to see earnings growth of 54.3% and 31.2% for 2019 and 2020, respectively. Barrick has also managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the prior four quarters, the positive avera ge earnings  surprise being 8.3%.   Headquartered in Vancouver, Canada, B2Gold Corp.

Markets were extremely volatile in August as investors were wary about the escalating tariff dispute between Washington and Beijing. As we step into September, trade tensions and fears of recession continue to bother the Wall Street.

In such a situation, investors are dumping stocks to park money in traditional safe-haven securities, leading to a year-to-date surge in gold price of roughly 19%.

 Escalating US-Sino Tariff Battle 

Since Sep 1, the Trump administration has imposed a 15% tariff on roughly $112 billion of imports from Beijing. America is set to impose a 15% tariff on a separate batch of Chinese goods of roughly $160 billion in value from Dec 15 onward.

Beijing retaliated and started imposing additional tariffs on several imports from the United States to initiate its plan to impose extra duty on $75 billion of American goods. Of the total of 5,078 U.S. products that Beijing imports, 1,717 items have seen additional tariffs of 5% and 10%, respectively. The rest of the countermeasures will be put into effect on Dec 15.

 Trade Dispute Threatens US Economy 

The latest round of tariff by the Trump administration on billions of dollar worth of Chinese imports has raised prices of consumer goods. Americans now need to pay higher prices for more than 66% of products that Washington imports from Beijing.

With higher retail prices for many products, the administration's latest stance is likely to impede America's economic growth since it is primarily driven by consumer spending.

AllianceBernstein, global asset management firm, believes that if the tariff dispute intensifies, businesses in America will curtail their hiring programs. This is likely to further hurt domestic consumer spending, thereby posing additional risks to the U.S. economy.

 Time to Pick Safe-Haven Stocks 

September is going to be challenging since there are reasons for the stock market to remain volatile. Hence, it would probably be safe for many investors to pick gold stocks which are considered to be safe haven as they can maintain or increase in value during market turmoil.

We have employed our proprietary stock screener  to shortlist potential gold stocks carrying either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see   the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here   .

Headquartered in Toronto, Canada, Kirkland Lake Gold Ltd KL  is a leading explorer and producer of gold. The company has an average positive earnings surprise of 6.1% for the past four quarters. Moreover, over the past 30 days, the #1 Ranked stock has been witnessing positive earnings estimate revisions for 2019 and 2020, respectively.

 AngloGold Ashanti Limited AU  , headquartered in Johannesburg, South Africa, is among the largest gold miners in the world. For 2019 and 2020, the Zacks #1 Ranked stock is likely to see earnings growth of 158.5% and 60.6%, respectively.

Headquartered in Toronto, Canada, Barrick Gold Corporation GOLD  is a leading explorer of gold with 61.5% interest in the prolific Nevada Gold Mines. The company, with a Zacks Rank of 2, is likely to see earnings growth of 54.3% and 31.2% for 2019 and 2020, respectively.

Barrick has also managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the prior four quarters, the positive avera ge earnings  surprise being 8.3%.  

Headquartered in Vancouver, Canada, B2Gold Corp. BTG  is a leading gold producer in the world. Through 2019 and 2020, the company with a Zacks Rank of 2 is likely to see earnings growth of 25% and 74.4%, respectively.

 Legalizing THIS Could Be Even Bigger than   Marijuana 

Americans spend an estimated $150 billion in this industry every year… more than twice as much as they spend on marijuana.

Now that 8 states have fully-legalized it (with several more states following close behind), Zacks has identified 5 stocks that could soar in response to the powerful demand. One industry insider described the future as ""mind-blowing"" - and early investors can still get in ahead of the surge.

2019-09-03 07:22:00," After completing a choppy August, market participants are extremely cautious about an uncertain September. Volatility in August was so severe that the broad-market S&P 500 Index recorded 11 moves of more than 1% in either direction in the 22 trading days of the month. It witnessed three declines of larger than 2.6%, including a 3% fall on Aug 5, the largest daily drop of the benchmark index so far in 2019.  makeArticleAd();  Wall Street will start its innings in September with a series of risk factors. Renewed tariff war between the United States and China, global economic slowdown, geopolitical conflicts are the major headwinds. However, the biggest event to watch will be the Fed's upcoming FOMC meeting this month, which will likely to guide investors' decisions for the next couple of months.   Stock Market's Major Sources of Risks    The tariff war between the United States and China intensified from Sep 1, as the U.S. government imposed 15% tariff on nearly $112 billion of Chinese goods. Most of these items are consumer products and various U.S. companies have already said that they have no option but to shift higher input costs to customers. Consequently, consumer spending, which jumped 0.6% in July, is likely to suffer a setback going forward. Notably, personal consumption constitutes two-third of the U.S. GDP.    Meanwhile, lingering trade war between the two largest trading nations of the world, is leading toward a global economic slowdown. Germany and Italy, the biggest two economies of the Eurozone, are facing manufacturing contraction for several months. The U.K.'s GDP shrank in the second quarter.    In Asia, China is increasingly facing the heat of the trade war with the United States. Aside from China, major Asian economies like Japan, South Korea and Taiwan recently warned about a slowdown due to the trade tussle.    Risk can also arise from various geopolitical conflicts. Possibility of a no-deal Brexit, political turmoil in Italy and Argentina, nationwide agitation for democracy in Hong Kong and oil-related conflict between the United States and Iran, can cause volatility as well.    Growing risk of stock market is forcing investors to get rid of risky assets like equities and invest in safe-haven government bonds. Globally, more than $16 trillion has been invested so far in 2019 in bonds with negative returns compared with $8 trillion at the end of 2018. This clearly indicates worldwide recessionary fears among market participants.   Fed to Play Lead Role    Irrespective of the above-mentioned concerns, it is Fed and only Fed, which is likely to be the major source of Wall Street's risk as well as the reason for stock rally in September. The Fed will meet on Sep 17-18 for its upcoming FOMC meeting.    The central bank's decision on benchmark interest rate will not only impact the market, but also determine investors' sentiment and decisions the most with its opinion on the economic situation and expectations of future economic activities.    This was clearly visible when an expected rate cut of 25 basis points resulted in a stock market decline after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that the rate cut is simply a mid-cycle correction. However, Powell later reiterated the central bank's pledge to do whatever needed to ensure the ongoing expansion of the U.S. economy.    The U.S. economy is currently facing a dichotomy. The consumer and labor markets are doing extremely well while the business segment, especially manufacturing, remained tepid owing to a prolonged trade dispute. Higher input costs and inability of management to plan properly due to frequent change of government decisions resulted in a slowdown in business investment.    Moreover, the PCE Price Index -- Fed's favorite gauge of inflation -- was 1.4% in July, well below the central bank's target rate of 2%. A lower interest rate means low cost of funds for both businesses and investors. This will result in higher business investment to promote growth.    As of Sep 3, 100% respondents of the CME FedWatch are expecting a second rate cut in September. While 97.3% are expecting a reduction of 25 basis points, a handful 2.7% are looking for a 50 basis point rate cut.   Our Top Picks    Under these circumstances, rate-sensitive investments like utilities, REITs, home builders and business services, with strong growth potential, will be prudent.

2019-09-03 08:50:00,"DUBAI, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Hurt by a slowdown in economic growth, Dubai could have a hard time financially supporting government-related entities that have piled up almost $60 billion of debt, S&P Global said in a research note on Tuesday.

Dubai's economy wobbled in 2009, when a global credit crisis caused its real estate market to crash and threatened to force some of its state-linked companies to default on billions of dollars of debt.

Dubai has seen another slump in the real estate market over the past few years, but the downturn has not been as severe as the one in 2009. 

S&P did not say that Dubai would need to provide extraordinary financial support to government-related entities, but that it would find it difficult to do so if it had to.

The agency estimated government-related entities' debt at $59 billion, equivalent to 52% of GDP in 2018. The Dubai government's own debt is estimated at $65 billion, 56% of GDP.

Dubai's government communications office did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment on the report. 

The federal United Arab Emirates government, backed by the oil-rich capital Abu Dhabi, would help Dubai if it found itself in financial distress, S&P said.

Dubai, one of the seven emirates that make up the UAE, got a $20 billion bailout from the central bank and from Abu Dhabi to escape the 2009 debt crisis.

S&P said it expected the debt would continue to be rolled over. Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters in February that the debt, which was due in March, would be extended for a second time after a first extension in 2014.

Dubai has been counting on an economic boost before and during the World Expo that it will host for six months starting October 2020. But Dubai's gross domestic product per capita fell to an estimated $36,000 in 2019 from a peak of $45,000 in 2013, indicating a weaker economy, S&P said.

Increased economic activity related to the Expo would see GDP growth average around 2.5% annually over the next three years, the agency added.","Dubai might struggle to support highly indebted state firms, S&P says - Nasdaq.com",https://www.nasdaq.com/article/dubai-might-struggle-to-support-highly-indebted-state-firms-sp-says-20190903-00791

ST. LOUIS/SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve should use its meeting in two weeks to aggressively cut interest rates, one U.S. central banker said on Tuesday.

Less than an hour later, a second U.S. central banker said he saw no need to use up the Fed's precious firepower when the economy is growing, inflation looks stable and labor markets are in good shape.

On one hand, the escalating U.S.-China trade war and a global economic slowdown have begun to pinch U.S. business spending and manufacturing output, posing a threat to the broader U.S. economy.

President Donald Trump has demanded the Fed cut rates to bolster growth as he piles tariffs on Chinese imports to try to win a better trade deal.

But Americans continue to spend, wages are rising and employers keep adding jobs, suggesting a downturn is not on the horizon.

Although Powell has said the Fed will act ""as appropriate"" to keep the economy growing, there is plenty of disagreement among his fellow rate-setters about what that two-word phrase means in practice.

In an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, Bullard argued that the Fed needs to get ahead of both financial market expectations for a small rate cut and a global trade war that has become a broader ""reckoning"" over how the world economy is organized. 

Underscoring his concerns, data released earlier on Tuesday showed the U.S. manufacturing sector had contracted for the first time in three years. U.S. stocks slid and benchmark Treasury yields hit their lowest in three years on concern the drawn-out trade war was taking an increasing toll on the U.S. and global economies.

""We are too high,"" Bullard said of Fed interest rates, noting that the central bank's current target policy rate of between 2% and 2.25% was higher than the current yield of all U.S. Treasury securities. Even the 30-year bond has dipped below 2%.

Speaking with students and teachers in Easton, Massachusetts, Rosengren said he saw no need to pre-emptively cut rates to offset risks that were not clearly making themselves felt in the U.S. economic data. He chalked up low long-term U.S. rates to troubles abroad that had not yet been felt at home.

With the Fed's policy rate only eight potential quarter-point rate cuts above zero - limited rate-cutting space to fight a downturn, he said - ""I don't want to use up that valuable space at a time where we actually think prices are pretty stable and the labor markets are pretty tight.""

""As long as we are growing around 2%, I don't see nearly as much of a need for taking immediate policy action,"" he said.

Bullard supported the Fed's quarter-point rate cut at its last meeting. Rosengren was one of two dissents in the 8-2 decision. The rate cut in July was the first since 2008.

Financial markets are currently splitting the difference, with short-term interest-rate futures contracts pricing in a 90% chance of a quarter-point rate cut when policymakers gather in Washington on Sept. 17 and 18 to set rates for the world's biggest economy.",To cut or not?

At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the TTM options chain for the new October 11th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.

Because the $7.50 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 64%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.67% return on the cash commitment, or 44.82% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost .

Considering the fact that the $8.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

NEW YORK, Sept 3 (Reuters) - U.S. companies planning to launch initial public offerings (IPOs) in the coming weeks are hoping that August's bout of stock market volatility will subside this month, according to investment bankers and capital markets lawyers advising them.

The U.S. trade war with China caused the stock market to seesaw in August. The CBOE Volatility index , Wall Street's fear gauge, rose around 17.7% last month, the second-biggest monthly jump so far in 2019. Last month was also the worst August for U.S. stocks in four years.

By contrast, almost 70 companies have registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for an IPO, according to research firm Renaissance Capital, which estimates companies could raise more than $15 billion from September until the end of 2019.

WeWork owner The We Company, food delivery platform Postmates Inc and fitness startup Peloton Interactive are among the companies expected to launch IPOs by the end of the year. Representatives for the three companies declined to comment on their IPO plans.

""I can safely say that this has been one of busiest Augusts we have ever had in terms of IPOs getting geared up for September,"" said David Goldschmidt, global head of capital markets at U.S. law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.

The U.S. market for IPOs typically gets back up to full speed once dealmakers and investors return to work after the Monday Labor Day holiday.

So far in 2019, companies have raised $36.5 billion through IPOs, down slightly on the same point in 2018 but the third most active year since the 2008 financial crisis, according to financial data provider Refinitiv.

While the shares of this year's two most high-profile IPOs, Uber Technologies Inc  and Lyft Inc , have performed poorly after their flotation, most IPOs have fared well in 2019.

Renaissance Capital's IPO-focused exchange-traded fund /IPO is up more than 30 percent so far in 2019, around double the rise in the S&P 500 Index over the same period. Strong IPO performers have included plant-based burger maker Beyond Meat Inc  and video conferencing company Zoom Video Communications Inc .

""Conditions could all change with a tweet (such as from U.S. President Donald Trump) but, when you look at the overall market backdrop, it feels maybe not perfect but still very good for IPOs,"" said Mike O'Donovan, partner in investment bank PJT Partners Inc's  strategic advisory business.

UNPREDICTABLE IPO WINDOW

In the background for companies weighing the timing of their IPO, is whether or not political rhetoric from U.S. presidential candidates could make for even rougher conditions.

The run-up to a U.S. presidential election has typically not had a major impact on prospective IPOs, though the November 2020 face-off between Republican Trump and a Democratic challenger is expected by market participants to trigger more volatility, given the polarization in U.S. politics.

""We are urging companies to be ready as soon as possible because the IPO windows have been so unpredictable,"" said Andrew Fabens, partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher and co-chair of the law firm's capital markets practice.

The likes of home-sharing company Airbnb Inc, payments startup Stripe and job search platform ZipRecruiter are expected to pursue IPOs next year, and it is unclear how close their IPOs would be to the presidential election.

Spokesman for Airbnb and ZipRecruiter declined to comment on a possible IPO. Stripe did respond to a request for comment.

""It would be incorrect to say the IPO window closes around elections,"" said Alex Wellins, co-founder of IPO advisory and investor relations firm Blueshirt Group LLC.

""That said,"" Wellins added, ""most people expect very high levels of volatility around this particular election.""",U.S. IPOs hope for stock market volatility reprieve - Nasdaq.com,https://www.nasdaq.com/article/us-ipos-hope-for-stock-market-volatility-reprieve-20190903-00296

NEW YORK, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The dollar was little changed on Tuesday against a basket of currencies, underpinned by safe-haven demand on worries about U.S.-China trade tensions and a chaotic British exit from the European Union.

Initial strength that propelled the dollar to a more than two-year peak fadedfollowing a private report that showed the U.S. manufacturing sector in August recorded its first monthly contraction since 2016. 

The steeper-than-expected decline in the factory activity index of the Institute for Supply Management touched off a rally in the U.S. bond market, sending benchmark 10-year yields  to their lowest levels since July 2016. 

Bloomberg News reported that Chinese and U.S. officials were struggling to agree on a schedule for a round of trade negotiations that had been expected this month.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson lost his working majority in Parliament when one of his Conservative lawmakers defected to the pro-European Union Liberal Democrats. 

In late U.S. trading, the dollar index , which tracks the greenback against versus six major currencies, was up 0.05% at 98.964. Earlier, it hit 99.37, its highest level since May 2017.

The euro stabilized after tumbling to a 28-month low against the dollar earlier Tuesday as investors priced in deeper negative interest rates for longer in the euro zone.

Money markets have increased to more than 80% the probability that the European Central Bank will cut its benchmark rate by 20 basis points when it meets next week.

The ECB benchmark rate now stands at minus 0.40% and the ECB has all but promised a monetary policy stimulus package as economic growth falters. Monday's PMI survey showed European manufacturing contracted for seven straight months.

The euro  was little changed at  $1.0966, after hitting $1.0926 earlier, its lowest level since mid-May 2017. A break below the key $1.1000 level last week had sparked heavier sell-offs.

The dollar weakened against the yen <JPY=EBS> and the Swiss franc <CHF=EBS> in the aftermath of the disappointing ISM manufacturing data. The greenback fell 0.2% to 106.045 yen and decreased 0.3% to 0.98745 franc.

Sterling was last up 0.22% at $1.209 after falling to $1.1959, the lowest level since October 2016, when it plunged to $1.1491 in a flash crash. Against the euro, sterling rose to  90.7 pence, rebounding from a two-week low of 91.47 pence .

2019-09-03 12:07:00,"JOHANNESBURG, Sept 3 (Reuters) - South Africa's rand firmed on Tuesday, buoyed by data showing the economy grew more than expected in the second quarter after a shock contraction previously.

At 1545 GMT, the rand  was 0.84% firmer against the dollar at 15.1300.

""There was a collective sigh of relief across the South African economy after economic growth surprised by expanding during the second quarter of 2019,"" said Lukman Otunuga, senior research analyst at FXTM.

Statistics South Africa said GDP growth in the three months to June was 3.1%, after a revised contraction of 3.1% in the first quarter. Economists polled by Reuters had predicted an expansion of 2.4% for the quarter.

2019-09-03 09:36:53,"A major hurricane is bearing down on the East Coast, and others likely will follow. As millions scramble to prepare for this latest natural disaster, it pays to assemble a financial emergency kit now.

Before we go into the contents of a financial emergency kit, here are a few pointers on disaster planning.

First, make your financial kit part of an overall disaster plan. You can get started on the planning process by going to the Department of Homeland Security's Ready.gov  website.

Image Source: FINRA

Second, while you can't guarantee that your kit will survive a disaster, you should keep it in an easily accessible-and easy to remember-location so you can access it quickly during an emergency. If you deplete items from your kit, replace them as soon as possible.

Finally, discuss with your family what you will do if you are separated, such as an agreed upon place to meet and how you will communicate with each other (phone, a shared voice mail or email box, social media, some other means).

You can decide how much you want to store in your financial emergency kit-and whether you want to make duplicates of contents and keep them in additional locations-but your kit should include these five items:

Your kit should contain enough ready money to facilitate daily life for a few days. How much is up to you, but think about what you would need to pay for food, lodging and other necessities. Cash is king in most emergencies since you may not be able to access ATMs or other electronic forms of payment. Also pack a set of essential keys (including a spare to a safe deposit box, if you have one).

Tip:  You can put a credit card in your kit for good measure, but don't depend on it.

Create a list with telephone numbers, emails or other contact information that includes family members, as well as key medical, financial and business contacts. All of this information can be stored electronically, too (with proper security precautions ), but keep a paper copy in your emergency kit as well.

Tip:  Now's the time to check with your bank or credit union to see if they offer disaster assistance, which may include flexible loan payment options, forgiveness of late charges and other services.

After a disaster strikes, you may have to confirm your identity to obtain disaster relief services, file insurance claims, or get access to your property and financial assets. Keep essential documents that help establish who you and your family are. These include extra originals or copies of passports, driver's licenses, birth and marriage certificates, adoption decrees, Social Security cards and military records.

Tip:  Check your financial account information periodically to ensure that your financial professional will be able to contact you in case of a disaster. If you have notified your broker or advisor of any changes to your name or address, confirm that the correct change has been made to your account by examining the notification your broker will send you within 30 days of the change. Also, some firms may ask whether you would like to designate a secondary or emergency contact for the account whom the firm could contact if it cannot get in touch with you, or has concerns about the your whereabouts or health.

A short list of financial documents to put in your kit includes mortgages, property deeds, legal documents such as a Power of Attorney and insurance policies. Also include recent financial statements for bank accounts, credit cards, brokerage accounts and statements related to investments that might be held outside a brokerage firm (such mutual funds or 529 college savings). If you access accounts or documents online, include a list of password hints. Also pack recent retirement account statements and your most recent tax return. A password-protected flash drive or file might be safer (and lighter) than hard copies-as long as you have a way to access the files.

Tip:  Get information about how to keep your tax records safe from the IRS's helpful resource Prepare for Hurricanes, Natural Disasters by Safeguarding Tax Records .

This will help you maximize the benefit from your insurance policies and will expedite the claims process. Assemble a paper, photo or video inventory, or a combination of these, and put it into your emergency kit. Save purchase receipts for major items or appraisals for valuable belongings. For your household items, walk through your house and write down what's in every room. For major items, record make and serial numbers. While you're at it, record the cost. Take close-up pictures of valuables, including details such as serial number tags. You can also videotape your belongings with a narrative description of the relevant information.

Tip:  Understand what your insurance covers and what will be required to make a claim in the event disaster strikes. Your policy may treat disasters differently (for example, flood damage may be handled differently than fire or hurricane damage). Do you have the right kind of insurance to cover what you own? Do you have enough coverage? And if you have completed major modifications to your house or other real estate property, does your present policy cover them?

NEW YORK, Sept 3 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields fell on Tuesday, with the benchmark 10-year yield hitting its lowest since July 2016, after U.S. manufacturing data showed the first contraction since 2016 on worries about a weakening global economy and U.S.-China trade tensions.

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity decreased in August to 49.1, the lowest since January 2016. A reading below 50 indicates contraction in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12% of the U.S. economy. Last month marked the first time since August 2016 that the index broke below the 50 threshold. 

Concerns about the economy, which is in its longest expansion ever, were also exacerbated by other data on Tuesday showing construction spending barely rising in July. The economy's waning fortunes have been blamed on the White House's year-long trade war with China.

President Donald Trump said on Tuesday trade talks with China were going well, but he warned that he would be ""tougher"" if the discussions dragged on past the 2020 U.S. election and he won a second term. 

Across maturities, yields fell. The 10-year yield  fell as low as 1.4290% and was last down 3.7 basis points to 1.4691%. The two-year yield  was 4.2 basis points lower at 1.4640%. The fall was greater in shorter-dated maturities, enough to steepen the yield curve out of inversion. The spread between two- and 10-year yields  was last at 0.20 basis points.

The ISM report was ""yet another piece of data showing a weaker manufacturing sector. That's the story,"" said Michael Pond, head of global inflation-linked research at Barclays.

""To the extent that manufacturing remains weak, that increases the potential chance for a recession down the road. That means lower yields and lower inflation expectations.""

The 30-year Treasury yield  fell to 1.9612%, near the historic low of 1.9050% hit on Aug. 28. The 30-year interest swap rate fell to a record low of 1.4762% on Tuesday after closing at 1.54% on Friday.","U.S. manufacturing shrinks, 10-year yield hits three-year low - Nasdaq.com",https://www.nasdaq.com/article/us-manufacturing-shrinks-10year-yield-hits-threeyear-low-20190903-01031

2019-09-03 15:18:00,"PARIS, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Relaunching the European Central Bank's bond purchasing programme is open to debate at the current juncture, ECB policymaker Francois Villeroy de Galhau said in an interview released on Tuesday, questioning its merit.

In an interview with French newspaper l'Agefi, Villeroy said uncertainty over U.S. trade policy was in large part to be blamed for fueling uncertainty at the source of the current economic slowdown.

The European Central Bank is set to debate later this month what steps to take in the face of slowing growth and inflation, which has stubbornly come in short of its 2 percent target.

""It also has the option of re-starting net asset purchases at any time. Is it necessary to do so just now? This is a question to be discussed,"" he added.

Villeroy said that current priority for the ECB was ""to better anchor inflation expectations to our target"", which he said should be done by revisiting its forward guidance on the path for short-term interest rates.

In particular, the ECB could be more precise by what it means when it refers to the ""continued sustained convergence of inflation to our aim over the medium-term"", Villeroy said.",ECB's Villeroy questions merits of restarting QE now - Nasdaq.com,https://www.nasdaq.com/article/ecbs-villeroy-questions-merits-of-restarting-qe-now-20190903-01025

LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The euro plunged to a 28-month low against the dollar on Tuesday as investors priced in deeper negative interest rates for longer in the euro zone.

The common currency's drop also came on the back of a strengthening dollar as the trade spat between Washington and Beijing intensified and traders turned to buying U.S. assets as safe-haven investments without hedging their dollar currency exposure, analysts said.

The ECB benchmark rate now stands at minus 0.40% and it has  all but promised a monetary policy stimulus package as economic growth falters. Monday's PMI survey showed European manufacturing contracted for seven straight months.

The euro  was last down by 0.3% at $1.0936. It fell to $1.0926 earlier, its lowest since mid-May 2017. A break below the key $1.1000 level last week had sparked heavier sell-offs.

Against an index of its six major rivals, the dollar  rose to 99.37 on Tuesday, the highest since mid-May 2017, as investors became more gloomy about the global economy's prospects amid the U.S.-China trade dispute.

Bloomberg News reported that Chinese and U.S. officials are struggling to agree a schedule for a round of trade negotiations that had been expected this month.

Overseas investors dived into buying U.S. Treasuries, considered the most liquid and safe investment in tumultuous times.

The 10-year Treasury bond yield fell 2.5 basis points to 1.48% on Tuesday, close to the low of $1.44% it reached last week that was last seen in mid-2016.

The flows have boosted the dollar, but investors' decision to either buy Treasuries unhedged, or trim some of their currency hedges has intensified the gains in the greenback, said Richard Falkenhall, senior forex strategist at SEB.

Higher government bonds in the United States compared with the rest of the developed world makes it worthless to buy U.S. government bonds to overseas investors if they also buy protection against unexpected swings in the U.S. currency.

""The dollar tends to outperform all other currencies except the yen"" when the global economy slows down, said Falkenhall.

""Everything is going in the same direction pointing to a stronger dollar,"" he said.

EURO AND ITALY

The euro could get some relief if the 5-Star Movement and the Democratic Party form a coalition government in Italy, analysts said. 5-Star members will vote on Tuesday on forming a coalition with PD.

""If the vote succeeds, the euro could gain somewhat,"" MUFG analysts said in a note, adding that ""Italian assets like bonds and stocks would likely rally somewhat further"".

Elsewhere, the pound fell to its lowest in nearly three years on Tuesday as British lawmakers prepared to vote on the first stage of their plan to block Prime Minister Boris Johnson from pursuing a no-deal Brexit. GBP/

Sterling was last down 0.4% at $1.2012  after falling to $1.1959, the lowest since October 2016, when it plunged to $1.1491 in a flash crash.

BUENOS AIRES, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Argentina's peso surged on Tuesday, pumped up by Wall Street traders cheering President Mauricio Macri's capital controls that are aimed at protecting the beleaguered currency.

The peso closed 5.39% higher at 55.98 per U.S. dollar, traders said, its strongest level in a week after a near record low close on Friday. Country risk, which soared to its highest level in more than a decade last month, also fell.

The currency rebound gives some relief to Macri, after a shock primary election battering last month sparked a sharp crash in the country's bonds, equities and the peso, which lost around 26% of its value against the greenback in August alone.

Argentina's S&P Merval stock index , however, took a hit in afternoon trading, closing down 11.9% at a two-year low in a slide that local analysts attributed to global trade jitters.

""All the markets are in the red and a weakened country like Argentina, with a complicated political situation, gets hits even more,"" said Hector Scasserra, director of local brokerage firm Arpenta Sociedad de Bolsa.

In Europe, the pounding of Argentina's bonds also eased after they had fallen to record lows on Monday, while there were tentative gains in some foreign-traded bank shares.

Ratings agency Fitch upgraded Argentina's long-term issuer debt rating to ""CC"" or just barely above default from ""restricted default"" saying the new rating reflects their view that ""a further default or debt restructuring of some kind is probable."" 

Frankfurt-listed American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) of Grupo Financiero Galicia  were up 0.6% after having tumbled 7.7.% on Monday while Banco Macro SA's  ADRs fell over 6% in New York, where markets were closed on Monday for a holiday.

MarketAxess data showed Argentina's century bond  traded marginally higher while the January 2028 bond  dipped under 37 cents on the dollar.

The black market peso, available via unofficial traders, also rose on Tuesday, although not as sharply as the official spot rate. Following a fall on Monday, it has now diverged from the official rate by the largest margin since 2015, a sign of tension over pricing of the currency. 

STILL AN EMERGING MARKET

Index provider MSCI said it was closely monitoring developments in Argentina but that the country's ""emerging market"" status for the purpose of MSCI indexes remained valid for now as MSCI Argentina only held foreign-listed shares.

Argentina was included in the emerging markets index in May, potentially boosting inflows to the eight stocks that were added. 

Any reclassification of Argentina in the widely followed indexes would first require a public consultation from MSCI.

On Sunday, the government authorized the central bank to restrict purchases of dollars as it burns through its reserves to prop up the peso. The currency controls were a 180-degree turn for Macri, a free-markets advocate who abolished capital controls after he came to power in 2015. 

It was the government's latest attempt to stabilize the peso, which has lost around 20% of its value since opposition presidential candidate Alberto Fernandez emerged as the clear front-runner in the Aug. 11 primary election.

On Tuesday, the government also said in a decree published in the country's official gazette that it would unilaterally hike the minimum wage by 35% over the next few months. Argentina's 12-month inflation is running at close to 55%.

Fernandez and his running mate, former President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, are considered a riskier prospect by investors, who fear Argentina could return to the interventionist policies of her former government.

On Monday, central bank president Guido Sandleris called Argentina's financial system ""strong"" and said the bank would adhere to its strict monetary policy, despite the currency restrictions. 

Sandleris, speaking at a news conference, said the bank was in talks with the International Monetary Fund to ""redefine"" the monetary goals for September under its $57 billion financing agreement.",Wall Street traders pump up Argentine peso as currency controls hit home - Nasdaq.com,https://www.nasdaq.com/article/wall-street-traders-pump-up-argentine-peso-as-currency-controls-hit-home-20190903-01004

The new government of Papua New Guinea will honor TOTAL's $13-billion gas deal signed with the previous government. (Read more: TOTAL Teams Up with Partners to Develop Papua LNG Project  )  makeArticleAd();  Notably, TOTAL and its partners ExxonMobil XOM  and Oil Search Ltd. will develop the Papua LNG Project. The new government approved the project after getting assurance that TOTAL will consider some future benefits for the country.   Rising Demand for LNG on a Global Basis    Natural gas' clean burning nature is making it an important choice for global energy transition toward emission less power generation. As it is not possible to export large volumes of natural gas across continents, the export of LNG is rising globally.    Per Yang Hua, the chairman of the board of China National Offshore Oil Corporation, global LNG trade is expected to exceed 500 billion cubic meters by 2030, indicating a rise of nearly 30% from 2017. A major portion of the demand is expected to come from emerging economies like China and India. This new LNG project, which is going to have an annual capacity of 5.4 million tons per annum, will allow TOTAL to reap the benefit of rising demand in the region.    TOTAL, with widespread assets across the globe, is steadily expanding global LNG operation.  At the end of the first half of 2019, the company's total LNG sales touched 12.7 million tons, substantially exceeding the year-ago level of 5.4 million tons. The start-up of Yamal LNG trains 2 and 3 in Russia, Ichthys LNG in Australia and the Cameron first LNG in the United States have driven TOTAL's LNG volumes.    Thanks to financial strength, TOTAL is not only developing new LNG projects like the one approved in Papua New Guinea, but also acquiring interests in new LNG prospects. During the first half of 2019, the company acquired a 10% stake in the Artic LNG 2 project in Russia.    Markedly, the LNG market is becoming highly competitive. Companies like Royal Dutch Shell RDS.A  and PetroChina PTR  , among others, have strong presence in the LNG space.   Zacks Rank and Price Movement    TOTAL currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The new government of Papua New Guinea will honor TOTAL's $13-billion gas deal signed with the previous government. (Read more: TOTAL Teams Up with Partners to Develop Papua LNG Project  )  makeArticleAd();  Notably, TOTAL and its partners ExxonMobil XOM  and Oil Search Ltd. will develop the Papua LNG Project. The new government approved the project after getting assurance that TOTAL will consider some future benefits for the country.   Rising Demand for LNG on a Global Basis    Natural gas' clean burning nature is making it an important choice for global energy transition toward emission less power generation. As it is not possible to export large volumes of natural gas across continents, the export of LNG is rising globally.    Per Yang Hua, the chairman of the board of China National Offshore Oil Corporation, global LNG trade is expected to exceed 500 billion cubic meters by 2030, indicating a rise of nearly 30% from 2017. A major portion of the demand is expected to come from emerging economies like China and India. This new LNG project, which is going to have an annual capacity of 5.4 million tons per annum, will allow TOTAL to reap the benefit of rising demand in the region.    TOTAL, with widespread assets across the globe, is steadily expanding global LNG operation.  At the end of the first half of 2019, the company's total LNG sales touched 12.7 million tons, substantially exceeding the year-ago level of 5.4 million tons. The start-up of Yamal LNG trains 2 and 3 in Russia, Ichthys LNG in Australia and the Cameron first LNG in the United States have driven TOTAL's LNG volumes.    Thanks to financial strength, TOTAL is not only developing new LNG projects like the one approved in Papua New Guinea, but also acquiring interests in new LNG prospects. During the first half of 2019, the company acquired a 10% stake in the Artic LNG 2 project in Russia.    Markedly, the LNG market is becoming highly competitive. Companies like Royal Dutch Shell RDS.A  and PetroChina PTR  , among others, have strong presence in the LNG space.   Zacks Rank and Price Movement    TOTAL currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here  .    In the past month, the company's shares have gained 1.5% against its industry  's decline of 1.9%.

2019-09-03 16:03:26,"Recession fears are back! The US dollar traded sharply lower after the ISM manufacturing report fell to its weakest level in more than 3 years. Manufacturing is an important part of the economy and one of the first to feel the effects of slower global growth. Manufacturing activity contracted for the first time since August 2016 as exports declined and new orders fell to a 7-year low. August was also the fifth straight month of weaker activity. The service sector represents a larger part of the economy but services won't be able to grow if manufacturing keeps contracting. In response to the disappointing report, Treasury yields dropped to fresh 2 year lows while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost more than 300 points. USD/JPY closed below 106 and EUR/USD rallied for the first time in 7 trading days. This deterioration in the manufacturing sector will make it difficult for the Federal Reserve to maintain a positive bias. We expect a cautious Beige Book tomorrow and look for the trade deficit to grow which should extend the losses for USD/JPY towards 105.

The only currency that performed worse than the US dollar today was the Canadian dollar. Investors are reluctant to buy loonies ahead of the Bank of Canada's monetary policy announcement. USD/CAD is hovering near 5-month highs and could hit 1.34 if the central bank suggests that they could lower interest rates in October. The Bank of Canada has been sitting comfortably on the sidelines but the market is pricing in 75% chance of a rate cut before the end of the year. Data from Canada hasn't been terrible but we are beginning to see signs of weakness. Retail sales stagnated in the month of July but ex autos spending was strong. Labor market conditions weakened but this week's employment report should show an improvement. Inflation hovers around the central bank's target and manufacturing activity is steady. With that said, a lot has changed since their policy meeting in July and Canada is not immune to US and China troubles. Expectations are building for a dovish BoC statement this week and if the BoC hints of a rate cut, USD/CAD will break out of its 3 week long range and make a run for 1.34. However if they keep their outlook unchanged, the relative strength of Canada's economy compared to the rest of the world should drive USD/CAD below 1.32.

The Australian dollar was the day's best performer. Although retail sales took an unexpected dip in July, the current account surplus hit its highest level in 44 years as the Reserve Bank made it clear that despite China's troubles they are in no rush to ease again. Exports in particular were very strong and will add 0.6% to tonight's second quarter GDP report. It is data like this that makes the central bank confident that ""growth will strengthen gradually to around trend."" The RBA said they will ease further if needed but in the same statement they highlighted the recovery in the housing market and indicated that stability in housing will support spending. They are also seeing a little upward pressure on wage growth, which eases their concerns about low inflation. From a fundamental and technical perspective, we could be witnessing a near term bottom in AUD/USD. With the pair ending the NY session at its highs, a stronger move above 68 cents is likely.

Meanwhile, EUR/USD snapped a 6 day losing streak. Its stability was driven entirely by anti-dollar flows but that could change tomorrow with revisions to EZ PMIs and Eurozone retail sales scheduled for release. Consumer spending in Germany fell sharply in July and this weakness is expected to carry over to the regional report. The greatest volatility today was in sterling, which dropped below 1.20 on reports that Parliament could call early elections. However the pair turned higher after defections from the Tory party caused the government to lost its working majority in the House of Commons. This could force Boris Johnson to go to the EU and request a 3 month delay until January 31st, which thee market perceives positively.

Sept 3 (Reuters) - Wall Street fell on Tuesday after datashowed U.S. manufacturing sector contracted for the first timesince 2016 in August, adding to fears that a protractedU.S.-China trade war could tip the world's largest economy intorecession.

The Institute for Supply Management said its index ofnational factory activity decreased to 49.1, compared with areading of 51.1 estimated by analysts polled by Reuters. urn:newsml:reuters.com:*:nL2N25U0KY

The weak data also weighed on U.S. Treasury yields, with thebenchmark 10-year yield US10YT=RR falling to its lowest sinceJuly 2016. Shares of banks .SPXBK , which typically come underpressure in a low interest rate environment, slid 2%. 

Trade-sensitive industrials .SPLRCI slipped 1.77%, whiletechnology stocks .SPLRCT fell 1.38%. 

In an escalation of their trade war, the United States onSunday began imposing 15% tariffs on a variety of Chinese goods,and China began imposing new duties on U.S. crude oil.

The tariffs that went into effect on Sunday are makinginvestors increasingly cynical towards the trade war, PeterCardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securitiesin New York said. 

The S&P 500 index fell 1.8% in August, its biggest monthlydrop since May, after escalating trade tensions and theinversion of a key part of the U.S. yield curve, seen as a signof recession, drove investors toward safe-haven assets.

However, trade tensions were dialed down last week followingsignals that Beijing and Washington would meet in September fortalks, but Bloomberg reported on Monday that the two sides wereyet to agree on a date for the planned meeting.

The energy sector .SPNY tumbled nearly 2% and was thebiggest loser among the 11 major S&P sectors, as rising OPEC andRussian crude output drove a 4% slump in oil prices. O/R

Chipmakers, which draw a large portion of their revenue fromChina, also fell, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor index .SOX off 2.06%.

2019-09-03 12:55:00,"BOGOTA, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Women entrepreneurs are playing a ""critical role"" in Colombia's economic development and its transition to peace, White House adviser Ivanka Trump said on Tuesday during a visit to Bogota.

The daughter of U.S. President Donald Trump was attending a launch event for the Academy of Women Entrepreneurs (AWE), a U.S. government-funded initiative aimed at reducing barriers to women's economic participation.

Colombia, long the closest U.S. ally in the region, is the first stop on a Latin American tour that will also take Trump to Paraguay and Argentina.

The academy is ""designed to equip women with the practical skills they need to create sustainable businesses and to participate more fully in the global economy,"" Trump said.

""This is particularly important in Colombia where women play an increasingly critical role in the country's economic development and continued transition to peace,"" she added.

The country's previous government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels signed a controversial peace deal in 2016, ending the group's role in five decades of conflict that have killed some 260,000 people.

The accord has faced hurdles, including unsuccessful efforts by President Ivan Duque to modify certain provisions, delays in subsidies for ex-fighters and the announcement last week by several former commanders that they would rearm. 

The announcement drew condemnation from the government, the United Nations and the FARC political party, whose leadership said the majority of ex-rebels remain committed despite ""difficulties and dangers.""","Women entrepreneurs play ""critical role"" in Colombia's economy, peace -Ivanka Trump - Nasdaq.com",https://www.nasdaq.com/article/women-entrepreneurs-play-critical-role-in-colombias-economy-peace-ivanka-trump-20190903-00952

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.

2019-09-03 15:13:14,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

In my years of investing, I've learned that when it comes to picking high-quality stocks, everything matters. It's not just about identifying stocks with low price-to-earnings multiples, or high yields. It's not just about finding stocks that always beat Wall Street's revenue and profit expectations. Nor is it just about insider buying, or the technical indicators, or any single thing.

Instead, it's about all those things. As it turns out, stock picking is a multi-dimensional analysis, and in order to be the best stock picker possible, you need to intimately understand all those dimensions.

Given that, I've developed a three-pronged framework for identifying winning stocks.

That framework is simple. First, and foremost, the stock needs to have favorable fundamentals, meaning the long-term fundamental growth prospects need to warrant upside in the stock from current levels. Second, the stock needs to have favorable optics, meaning that there needs to be a reason or set of reasons why investors will want to buy this stock both now and for the foreseeable future. Third, the stock needs to have favorable technicals, since good technicals provide psychological support for continued bullish investor sentiment.

If a stock checks off all three of those boxes, I call it a ""Triple Threat Stock"" - and in my experience, these Triple Threat Stocks have been big winners over the long run.

With that in mind, let's take a look at 7 of my favorite Triple Threat Stocks to buy for the long term.

The Fundamentals:  The fundamentals supporting e-commerce solutions provider Shopify (NYSE: SHOP ) are about as good as you're going to find in the market. Shopify is powering a new era of direct decentralized commerce, enabling merchants of all shapes and sizes to successfully sell directly to their customers. This is a huge growth market, since we are migrating to a do-it-yourself economy with consumers who favor decentralized systems over centralized ones.

The growth trajectory is consequently robust, with steady 50%-plus sales volume growth over the past several quarters. The long-term revenue potential is huge, as Shopify accounts for less than 2% of total e-retail sales. The long-term profit potential is also huge, because gross margins here are north of 50% and the opex rate has tremendous room to fall with scale.

Net net, Shopify projects as a big revenue and profit grower for a lot longer as secular tailwinds expand the direct decentralized retail model from niche, to mainstream. All that growth firepower will inevitably push SHOP stock higher long term.

The Optics:  The optics supporting SHOP stock are similarly favorable across the board. For starters, SHOP stock has been working in a flat market. Since the trade war started, the stock has more than tripled, while the market has gone nowhere. Existing investors are going to what to stick with what's working. New investors are going to want to pile into what's working.

Further, Shopify is a big growth stock in a super low rate environment. That's an attractive combo since low rates help support long duration assets. Even further, Shopify's growth narrative has almost nothing to do with China and the trade war. Thus, this stock is side-stepping the market's biggest risk right now.

The Technicals:  SHOP stock is up nearly 200% year-to-date, and the chart looks like a steady, straight-line up from ~$150 to ~$400. As far as charts go, they don't get much prettier than this one. SHOP is a prime stock to buy.

The Fundamentals:  The fundamentals underlying Walmart (NYSE: WMT ) have been, still are, and will remain for the foreseeable future, rock-solid.

Walmart is the world's biggest retailer. They got to this position for two reasons. One, they've dominated on price - that is, they have always offered the lowest prices in the market, and because consumers are always attracted to low prices, consumers have consistently been attracted to Walmart's low prices. Second, they've dominated on convenience. Walmart has an extensive real estate footprint that puts Walmart's stores within reasonable driving distance of almost every U.S. consumer. Because consumers are also always attracted to high convenience, consumers have consistently been attracted to Walmart's unparalleled convenience.

Over the past several decades, dominance on these two fronts has powered big comparable sales, revenue, and profit.

This dynamic will continue for the foreseeable future. Walmart's prices are still the lowest in the market - recent studies support that Walmart.com offers lower prices than even Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ). Also, Walmart's convenience is only going up, as the company is rapidly expanding its e-commerce business and its omni-channel capabilities so that consumers can shop how they want and when they want.

Consequently, Walmart's comps, sales, and profits will continue to march higher for the foreseeable future. As they do, WMT stock will power higher, too.

The Optics:  The optics supporting Walmart as one of are stocks to buy are favorable, led by three big things.

First, the U.S. consumer is on fire right now, and Walmart is a U.S. consumer story. Pockets of the global economy are showing weakness. The U.S. consumer is not. So long as the U.S. consumer remains one of the few good things about the global economy, investors will pile into stocks which have big U.S. consumer exposure - like WMT.

Second, Walmart is on fire right now. Thanks to the fact that this company has figured out the digital game and is rapidly expanding its omni-channel footprint, Walmart is firing off decade-best comparable sales and traffic growth numbers. Thus, not only is Walmart exposed to one of the few pockets of the global economy that is working, but that exposure is high-quality exposure.

Third, Walmart is recession-proof. Sure, a lot of investors throw that term around a lot. But, Walmart actually is recession proof. When a recession hits, consumers migrate to low-price retailers like Walmart. As such, Walmart can actually experience growth in an economic downturn. Look no further than 2007-09. While the S&P 500 collapsed 60%, WMT stock actually rose more than a percent over that same stretch.

The Technicals:  WMT stock has formed a solid uptrend over the past five years of higher lows and higher highs. That uptrend has remained in-tact in 2019. Indeed, it isn't showing any signs of breaking. As such, the technicals here point to continued secular strength.

The Fundamentals:  Over at programmatic advertising leader The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD ), you have similar long-term growth fundamentals as at Shopify. That is, you have a hyper-growth company with a huge opportunity in front of it, which operates at sky high margins, and has visibility towards huge profits in the long run.

The narrative at The Trade Desk begins and ends with automation and data. That is, automation and data are transforming work flows and processes everywhere - making them smarter, faster, and cheaper. The Trade Desk applies automation and data to the advertising world through what is called programmatic advertising - which is just leveraging data and machine learning to automate and optimize the way companies spend their ad dollars.

Companies left and right are adopting programmatic advertising in bulk. That's why The Trade Desk has rattled off multiple consecutive quarters of 40%-plus revenue growth. These big growth quarters will stick around for a lot longer. Less than 1% of global digital-ad spend went through The Trade Desk last year, meaning this company has tons of room to expand share in a secular growth market for a lot longer.

Gross margins are big, too, so as scale drives positive operating leverage over time, The Trade Desk stands to produce a ton of profits in the long run. All of those profits will add up to a TTD stock price in 5 years that is way higher than today's price tag, which is key when you're looking for stocks to buy.

The Optics:  The optics on TTD stock support continued strong investor demand for the foreseeable future. These favorable optics break down into two parts.

First, The Trade Desk has worked in a flat market. Since the trade war started in January 2018, the major indices have gone nowhere. TTD stock has risen nearly five-fold over that same stretch. Existing investors want to stick with this beacon of strength. New investors will want to buy into it.

Second, TTD stock is a big-time growth stock that derives essentially all of its value from future profits. In a low rate environment - like the one we find ourselves in today - those future profits have a higher present value. As such, today's environment is one wherein investors will continue to look for exposure to high-quality, long-duration assets. TTD stock is one of those assets.

The Technicals: Over the past three years, TTD stock has formed a pattern. Rally big for a few months, and then consolidate around the 50-day moving average for a few months, all while maintaining a big spread over the 200-day moving average. Early 2019 was part one - the multi-month surge. Mid-2019 has been part two - the consolidation around the 50-day. Presumably, this ends with a repeat of part one - another multi-month surge higher towards $300.

The Fundamentals:  Lather, rinse, and repeat the Shopify and Trade Desk fundamental growth narratives for the next of our Triple Threat Stocks to buy. Security giant Okta (NASDAQ: OKTA ) is a big growth company with tons of room to grow, operating at sky high margins with the potential to produce enormous profits at scale.

Okta is a cloud security company. But they are a unique cloud security company. They focus on what is called identity access management. That is, as opposed to outfitting an entire enterprise ecosystem with a castle of cloud security defense, Okta outfits each individual in the enterprise ecosystem with their own personalized armor of cloud security defense.

This solution is optimal, mostly because overarching security systems can be restrictive and identity-based ones are flexible, and flexibility is extremely important to dynamic enterprises who often utilize many different software applications. Consequently, Okta's Identity Cloud solution has been swiftly adopted across the enterprise world, with customer and revenue growth rates at Okta consistently hovering north of 40%.

There's also plenty of room to grow here. At last count, Okta had 7,000 customers. There are over 30 million enterprises in the U.S. - all of whom could use Okta's Identity Cloud. There are several hundred million enterprises worldwide. Thus, this growth narrative is still in its first few innings.

On top of it all, Okta runs at 70%-plus gross margins, so the company has visible runway to producing huge profits at scale. Over the course of the next several years, as Okta's profits do run significantly higher, OKTA stock will run significantly higher, too.

The Optics:  There are three big drivers of the favorable optics supporting OKTA stock at the current moment.

The first two we've already discussed in this gallery. First, the stock has been working in a flat market - up 300%-plus since the trade war started - and investors will want to stick with what has been working. Second, this is a big time growth stock supported by exceptionally low rates.

The third point is a bit more unique. Okta is a cloud company. The cloud space is on fire right now. It also has minimal exposure to China and the trade war. Indeed, an economic downturn could actually help the cloud industry by accelerating the on-premise to cloud shift. After all, cloud is supposed to cheaper, and cheaper wins out when money becomes tight.

The Technicals:  OKTA stock has been on fire over the past year. But every once in a while, it does go through rough patches. In those rough patches, the stock tends to consolidate around the 50-day moving average before sprinting higher - see late 2018 and February/March 2019. It appears OKTA is going through a similar consolidation right now. History says this consolidation around the 50-day will end in a big move higher.

The Fundamentals:  In 2018, the core growth fundamentals underlying Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) looked shaky. But now that the company has put those issues behind it, the long term growth fundamentals for this stock to buy look as strong ever.

In a nutshell, Facebook's owns four of the world's favorite and most-used digital properties - Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. For most consumers, these applications are more than just fun apps. They are utilities digital consumers use everyday to keep in touch with friends, communicate with others, and stay up-to-date with current events. As such, consumers are hooked to these platforms and they aren't leaving anytime soon. If the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal didn't get people quit (and it didn't), I don't know what will.

So long as users stay in the Facebook ecosystem, ad dollars from across the world will continue to flood into the ecosystem. Facebook is also pushing the envelope on commerce. Considering the ecosystem is essentially the world's largest marketplace with 2.7 billion active potential buyers, these commerce growth initiatives could produce big results.

Bottom line: ad revenue growth rates will remain big for the foreseeable future, and new e-commerce revenue will supercharge the overall top-line growth trajectory. Gross margins across the board will remain healthy. The opex rate will fall as big data security investments phase out. Net profits margins will move higher. So will profits.

As profits move higher, FB stock will, too. That's because, at 23-times forward earnings, this stock is still cheap relative to its long-term growth potential.

The Optics:  The optics here are better than they've been in a long time. Facebook is shaking off the rust from an ugly 2018. In so doing, investors are starting to see that the company really wasn't damaged - at all - during one of the most controversial issues in corporate America in the past decade. Investors are therefore starting to realize just how sticky the Facebook ecosystem is, and how strong and healthy the long-term growth prospects are for Facebook.

As they realize this, they want back in. That's why we've seen a big YTD rally in FB stock. But the stock is still well off its 2018 highs. Thus, investors will keep wanting ""in"" until the stock breaks through those highs. That gives the stock plenty of runway to keep moving higher.

The Technicals:  FB stock has formed a clean uptrend in 2019 of distinct higher highs and higher lows. The stock recently tested and held the support line in this uptrend. It is now bouncing off that support line - a strong sign that the uptrend is in-tact. If so, the technicals here reasonably point towards a rally to a new higher high, or somewhere above $210.

The Fundamentals:  The fundamentals for Lululemon (NASDAQ: LULU ) are exceptionally favorable in the long run for two big reasons. First, the athletic apparel market is on fire and projects to remain on fire. Second, Lululemon is the hottest brand in that athletic apparel market and should remain so for the foreseeable future.

On the first point, the athletic apparel market is the shining star of the retail world. Retail sales have been moving higher at a steady pace, thanks to healthy labor conditions. But athletic apparel sales have been outpacing the crowd. This is due to secular trends, such as eating right, being fit, and staying healthy, the sum of which have pushed consumers to workout more and live healthier, more active lifestyles. A big part of that is buying the right clothes to fit that lifestyle - hence, the big surge in athletic apparel spend over the past few years.

On the second point, Lululemon is the hottest and most relevant brand in the athletic apparel space. Thanks to genius marketing and merchandising, Lululemon has struck the sweet spot of controlling high prices and still driving big demand, all while maximizing brand equity. That is to say, Lululemon's clothes are expensive enough to where they are a status symbol, and yet aren't expensive enough to where they eliminate mass market demand.

In striking this sweet spot, Lululemon is driving mass market demand at favorable price points. The result? Big comparable sales growth, big margin expansion, and even bigger profit growth.

This dynamic projects to persist for the foreseeable future. Why? Because Lululemon is still small. They did just $3.5 billion sales over the past 12 months. Nike (NYSE: NKE ) did about $40 billion. Thus, Lululemon has plenty of runway to keep growing at a robust rate for a lot longer.

The Optics:  The optics here are simple and favorable. The U.S. consumer - and to a lesser extent, the global consumer - is working right now. Many other parts of the global economy aren't working. Thus, investors today are craving consumer exposure.

The highest quality form of consumer exposure is exposure to the athletic apparel industry since secular tailwinds have and will continue to promote above-trend growth across this whole space. In that athletic apparel industry, the company that stands out from the pack as the fastest grower with the most long-term potential is Lululemon.

For the foreseeable future, investors will follow that same logic train to arrive at the same conclusion. In today's environment, buy LULU stock.

The Technicals:  As is the case with many other stocks on this list, LULU stock has found tremendous support over the past year in its 50-day moving average. See late 2018, late March 2019, and early June 2019. Today belongs in that list, too. LULU stock is consolidating around its 50-day moving average amid trade war turbulence. The implication is that once this trade war turbulence passes, LULU stock will fly higher.

The Fundamentals:  High-flying digital-education company Chegg (NASDAQ: CHGG ) is yet another growth stock supported by very favorable long-term growth fundamentals. Specifically, this is a big growth company, in a secular growth market, with very little competition, which runs at huge margins, with a ton of runway to keep growing, and the potential to produce huge profits at scale.

Long story short, Chegg is the digital education company that high school and college students across America have needed for the past decade. Everything high school and college students interact with these days is all digital. The one big exception? School. The academic world has been slower to pivot to the digital revolution. Chegg is changing that. They have made a digital education companion built for students in the 21st Century, complete with digital on-demand tutoring services, e-textbooks, tutorial videos, solution manuals, writing help, citation makers, so on and so forth.

Chegg bundles all these services into a subscription offering, and sells that to students across America. Demand has been robust thus far - services revenue growth has exceeded 30% in each of the past several years. The best part? Chegg is only getting started. They have about 3 million subscribers on their connected learning platform. There are 36 million high school and college students in the U.S. alone - and far, far more globally. Thus, Chegg is penetrating a very small portion of its addressable market.

Over the next several years, then, Chegg will rattle off several more 20%-plus and 30%-plus revenue growth quarters. All those big growth quarters will be accompanied by big profit growth, too, since the Services business runs at ~80% gross margins.

Fast forward 5 years. Chegg will have a lot more subscribers, a lot more revenues, and a lot more profits. CHGG stock price should be significantly higher, too.

The Optics:  With CHGG stock, there are three components to the favorable optics underlying the stock.

First, Chegg has been a shining star in a flat market. It's up 130% since the trade war began. Investors will want to stick with this strength so long as the trade war hangs around.

Second, Chegg is a big growth stock with a big valuation. The stock derives a ton of its value from future profits. As mentioned earlier, those profits get a boost when rates are low. Thus, today's low rate environment is favorable for CHGG stock.

Third, this is a U.S.-only growth story. While the global economy may be slipping, the U.S. economy appears to be doing just fine. Further, this is a U.S. student growth story. U.S. students will likely continue to pay for educational services regardless of the economic backdrop.

The Technicals:  In 2019, CHGG stock has formed a clean uptrend of higher highs and higher lows. The stock is currently testing the support line of that uptrend. Will it hold? Given the favorable fundamentals and optics, probably. If it does, the technicals would imply a rally in CHGG stock towards a new higher high, or somewhere north of $48.

As of this writing, Luke Lango was long SHOP, WMT, TTD, OKTA, FB, LULU, NKE, and CHGG.

A recent statistic from GlobalData said that the affluent population in China, which includes both mass affluents and high-net-worth individuals, is expected to grow by 41% from 40.13 million to 56.67 million. Chinese stocks will benefit from this ongoing surge in the number of wealthy people in the country. 

According to GlobalData, the ""mass affluent"" includes anyone with liquid assets between $50,000 and $1 million, while the ""high-net-worth individual"" is anyone with liquid assets of more than $1 million. China is home to the third-highest number of affluent people behind only the U.S. and Japan. 

 ""This growth will be driven by rising levels of urbanization, infrastructure expansion, and high investment inflows in the country. Going forward, the number of affluent Chinese individuals is forecast to grow at a similar rate, reflecting the country's positive economic growth,"" stated Shivani Gupta, Wealth Analyst at GlobalData. 

So, which Chinese stocks will win between now and 2022? A likely place to start for stocks to buy are those companies focused on retail, both online and off. Not all of them will be based in China to benefit from the surge in the affluent population. 

Here are what I believe to be the 10 stocks to buy to ride this trend.  

New Oriental Education (NYSE: EDU ) is the largest provider of private educational services in China. Those with the means to provide their children with additional schooling and tutoring are going to do so. EDU stock will benefit from this demand. 

On July 23, New Oriental announced its fourth-quarter results. They were extremely healthy. On the top line, net revenue increased by 20.2% compared to last year to $842.9 million, with operating income up 36.0% to $77.0 million. In fiscal 2019, New Oriental saw sales increase 26.5% to $3.1 billion, with operating income rising 16.2% to $305.5 million. 

During the fourth quarter, the company saw total student enrollments in academic subjects tutoring and test preparation courses increase by 33.9% to 2.8 million people, with the number of schools and learning centers increased by 152 to 1,233. 

On Aug. 29, EDU stock hit a 52-week high of $112.49. Its stock is up 98.4% year to date.  New Oriental continues to be one of my favorite Chinese stocks.

As Chinese stocks go, Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) has the highest potential to do big things outside its domestic market. While the Chinese market is massive, it is the market share that it can capture outside of China that will dictate how big it becomes. 

The e-commerce dynamo recently had a bit of a setback. It had planned to list its shares in Hong Kong by doing a secondary offering to raise a little cash and more importantly, bring its stock a little closer to home. Unfortunately, with all the protests going on over there, it decided to delay its Hong Kong listing until the fall or later. 

As I wrote on Aug. 26, it's not a big deal because of the company's firing on all cylinders at the moment. Its e-commerce and cloud businesses had revenue growth of 40% and 66% year over year in the latest quarter. It finished the quarter with $30.7 billion in cash. 

Alibaba stock is up 24% year to date.

For Nio's (NYSE: NIO ) sake, the affluent in China better be buying both its ES8 (7-seater) and ES6 (5-seater) over the next 12-24 months, because if they're not willing to fork over the dough for the tech-heavy SUV, it's unlikely that the middle class will be ready to spend the money. 

Also, the Chinese government is winding down the EV and plug-in hybrid subsidies. By the end of 2020 , they should be gone. Adding to Nio's troubles, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) is expected to begin manufacturing the Model 3 in China by the end of 2019. Those Tesla's will come with lower prices due to the lack of a tariff on the vehicles. 

I've been very tough on Nio in the past year because it loses more money than it generates in sales. That's not a sustainable business model. However, it's hard to deny that its vehicles are attractive.

At less than $3, NIO stock is a good buy, but for aggressive investors only. 

 The one thing I know about the wealthy is that they love to travel.

Carlyle Group (NASDAQ: CG ) Co-Chairman David Rubenstein recently had an interesting story to share with Ctrip.com (NASDAQ: CTRP ) CEO Jane Sun while speaking together at the 2019 Aspen Action Forum in Aspen, Colorado. 

Rubenstein mentioned that he had invested in the Chinese travel service provider back in 2003 when it was valued at $100 million. Rubenstein sold his stock for a 450% profit.

""At the time, we thought how brilliant are we? The company is today worth USD $21 billion. I guess I sold too soon, right?"" Rubenstein told the Aspen audience. 

""I'm sure that the travel industry will continue to grow, and Ctrip's will capitalize on those opportunities,"" Sun said. ""And I hope we can live up to the expectations of promoting the global economy and global peace.""

Although geopolitical issues are affecting leisure and corporate travel in China at the moment, the long-term prognosis continues to be good as the affluent look to do more air travel than in the past. 

China Life Insurance (NYSE: LFC ) is one of the largest life insurance companies in China. It has more than 285 million life insurance policies, annuities, and other financial contracts in place. It is also one of the country's largest asset managers due to its controlling stake in China Life Asset Management Co. Ltd. 

The insurer reported its latest quarterly report on Aug. 22. Its net profit was 129% higher year over year to $5.3 billion. Its total premiums increased by 5% during the quarter and its stock is up 12.8% year to date through Aug. 28.

In November, I suggested that LFC stock was one Chinese stock I thought was worth buying given it had lost 31% with one month left in 2018. Since then it's up 14%.

68%-owned by the Chinese government, some investors might not feel all that comfortable about their investment. I'm not one of them. It is the Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A , NYSE: BRK.B ) of China.

As I mentioned in the section on Nio, the affluent are big car buyers.  Autohome (NYSE: ATHM ) provides consumers in China with the information and services required to successfully buy a car, including financing, insurance, used car sales, etc. 

The company announced its second-quarter results Aug. 7 and they were very healthy. On the top line, Autohome's revenue increased by 23.5% to $323.2 million. On the bottom line, net income increased by 14.9% to $119.7 million. That's a very impressive net margin of 37%.   

""In the second quarter, we maintained the solid growth momentum in our core business. Our new initiatives once again picked up steam and gained positive market recognition,"" stated CFO Jun Zou.

On Aug. 18, Autohome held the world's first virtual reality auto show with more than 80 auto brands and over 2,400 dealers taking part. It plans to do more of this type of activity in the future to increase the exposure of the auto industry in China. 

If Autohome keeps this up, you can be sure the profits will continue to roll in.  

 If there's a Chinese stock that confuses me, it's got to be Noah Holdings (NYSE: NOAH ). The Shanghai-based wealth manager aims to service clients with a net worth of a least $140,000. I've recommended it on several occasions in the past because I felt the growing middle class in China, not to mention the affluent class, would provide it with plenty of business. 

However, despite having more than $25 billion in assets under management and a growing online presence, its stock has lost half its value since reaching a $4 billion market cap in May 2018. 

As the Financial Times recently reported , the company distributed products involving supply-chain financing from a third party to its clients that turned out to be fraudulent. 

Noah reported Q2 2019 earnings on Aug. 28. In its conference call , NOAH openly dealt with the issue and feels the incident will eventually be in the rearview mirror. 

Do your due diligence on Noah, but this latest issue won't change my opinion about the company. I still believe it's got an excellent opportunity to win over a big chunk of the Chinese wealth management business.

If there's a company to benefit from the increase in affluent people in China, it would have to be LVMH (OTCMKTS: LVMUY ), whose Louis Vuitton bags, Tag Heuer watches, and Moet & Chandon champagne are fashionable in the country of 1.4 billion people. 

In June, Vuitton Chief Executive Michael Burke said that Louis Vuitton is experiencing ""unheard of growth rates"" in China. The Chinese are buying more handbags and watches domestically than they are while traveling outside the country. 

One of the advantages for LVMH is that the Chinese have lowered tariffs from European products to encourage consumers to buy in China instead of overseas, and then resell them once back on the mainland. 

Regardless of what's happening with the U.S.-China trade war, LVMH CEO and founder Bernard Arnault continues to build a retail conglomerate like no other. 

Arnault is currently the world's third-richest person with a net worth of $96.0 billion , $27.4 billion higher in 2019, vaulting him $16 billion ahead of Warren Buffett. China will continue to be good for both LVMH and Arnault. 

 I thought I would throw in a Canadian company that's doing well in China.  Manulife Financial (NYSE: MFC ) is primarily a life insurance company. It owns John Hancock in the U.S. and has a large wealth and asset management business.

In the second quarter ended June 30, Manulife had C$1.45 billion in core earnings, C$471 million from its Asian business, which represents 32% of its overall earnings. By contrast, its Canadian insurance business accounts for 21% of its core earnings while the U.S. is responsible for 30% of its core earnings. Its global wealth and asset management business accounted for the remaining 17%. 

CEO Roy Gori, who ran the company's Asian business before taking the top job, said about the second quarter:

""We delivered solid core earnings and net income of $1.5 billion in the quarter, with double-digit core earnings growth in Asia,"" Gori stated. ""We have also taken steps to further strengthen Manulife's long-term growth opportunity in Asia, including entering into an asset management joint venture agreement in India."" 

Although the company's Asian head office is in Hong Kong, it also has offices in Shanghai and Beijing. The company's first insurance policy in Asia was sold in Shanghai in 1897 .

One of the quickest and easiest ways to benefit from the surge in affluent people in China is to buy an ETF like the iShares MSCI China ETF (NYSEARCA: MCHI ), which provides exposure to a portfolio of mid-sized and large-sized companies based in China. 

The ETF tracks the performance of the MSCI China Index. It has a total of 462 holdings with a significant number of Chinese financial stocks that aren't listed in the U.S. Given wealthy people generally are in greater need of financial services, owning this ETF would help you ride the affluent trend. 

It charges 0.58% annually, which is reasonable given that many of the stocks can't be bought on a U.S. exchange. 

The ETFs top 10 holdings account for 48% of its $3.5 billion in total assets. The top three sectors: consumer cyclical, financial services, and technology, account for 67% of its total holdings. The average market cap is $67.3 billion.  

At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-03 07:33:00,"  The Home Depot Inc. HD  is one of the investor favorite home improvement stocks, courtesy of sound fundamentals as well as efforts to provide an interconnected shopping experience to customers, with innovative products and improved productivity. We note that shares of the Atlanta, GA-based company have advanced 32.6% year to date compared with the industry  's growth of 27.6%.  makeArticleAd();  The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has also comfortably outperformed the Retail-Wholesale  sector and the S&P 500 Index that grew 18.7% and 15.3%, respectively. Further, the stock hit a 52-week high of $229.27 on Aug 30. In all likelihood, Home Depot, with a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.7%, can reach new heights.    You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank   (Strong Buy) stocks here   .        Endeavors to Drive Momentum    The company's fundamental strength is highlighted by its positive earnings surprise trend recorded for more than five years. Progress on strategic investments as well as a favorable consumer environment in the United States and a steady housing market has been contributing to this robust surprise trend.    Home Depot is witnessing significant benefits from the execution of its ""One Home Depot"" investment plan, focused on delivering an interconnected shopping experience for customers. In-store investments under the plan have resulted in enhanced navigation through the introduction of way-finding sign and store refresh package in more than 1,400 U.S. stores so far. These along with front-end store investments to optimize labor and merchandise space productivity led to improved customer satisfaction scores and improved conversion rates in stores.    Further, the introduction of digital price labels in the appliance department brought the ratings and reviews of the digital world into its store shopping experience. Though physical stores are the key to its business, the company identifies many of in-store purchases to be the result of online visits. Additionally, nearly 50% of the online orders in the United States are picked up from stores, reflecting the relevance of stores amid the growing popularity of e-commerce. The blended customer engagement across both channels forms the basis for the company's integrated retail strategy that connects offline and online channels.    On the digital front, it is investing in its website and other applications to further enhance online customer experience. It is witnessing higher traffic, better conversion and continued sales growth in the digital business through improved search capabilities, site functionality, category presentation and product content. Moreover, the company continues to roll out automated lockers in stores to make picking-up of online orders easier and convenient. Currently, automated lockers are available in about 1,100 stores.    The company is also making efforts to leverage the digital business to boost sales for new categories like HD Home pool and workwear. These investments across the digital and physical assets are likely to drive its productivity growth, apart from boosting customer experience.    Home Depot is focused on ramping up investments in all facets of business in the wake of rising competition from the likes of Lowe's Companies LOW  , Walmart WMT  and Target TGT  . We believe that the company's commitment toward improving customer experiences through its interconnected strategy will continue to drive traffic.    With the ""One Home Depot"" investment plan on track, it is nearing the financial goals outlined in December 2017. It reiterated the targets for fiscal 2020, anticipating total sales of nearly $115-$120 billion, representing compounded annual sales growth of nearly 4.5-6%. Operating margin is expected to be 14.4-15%. Moreover, the company expects annual average capital spending to be about 2.5% of sales. Alongside achieving these targets, it plans to accelerate investments in the next three years to enhance customer experience and shareholder value.   Pro Segment - A Star Performer    Home Depot's Pro segment is a key growth driver, with Pro sales outpacing DIY (do-it-yourself) sales for the past several quarters. The Pro segment is benefiting from the company's efforts to enhance service capabilities for the Pros. Home Depot is focused on simplifying the Pro shopping experience and expanding engagement through services like tool rental, delivery and the new B2B website. The B2B platform brings a more personalized experience to Pro customers based on customer feedback. The company expects to roll out the new Pro online experience to more than a million Pros by 2019.    Additionally, it equipped store personnel with several tools to better understand Pro customers. The latest among these tools is the My View system, which enables associates to access customer data, allowing working proactively to better serve Pro customers.   Wrapping Up    As already detailed, we expect Home Depot's bottom-line momentum to continue in the quarters ahead. The company's efforts to catch up with the changing retail landscape positions it in an advantageous position compared with its rivals. Further, favorable economic conditions, anchored by an improving job market and robust consumer spending as well as stable housing market add enough fodder for sustaining growth in the long run.

","Home Depot (HD) Displays Solid Run-Up, Adds More Than 30% YTD - Nasdaq.com",https://www.nasdaq.com/article/home-depot-hd-displays-solid-run-up-adds-more-than-30-ytd-cm1206552
2019-09-03 14:30:00," Currencies of emerging markets witnessed the worst August on record in 2019  , per Bloomberg. WisdomTree Emerging Currency Strategy Fund CEW  lost about 2% in the month  against 1.1% gain of the Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund UUP  . Let's take a look at what led to the slump (read: August ETF Events That Grab Headlines  ).  Re-escalation of US-China Trade War  The month saw a spike in the tariff battle between the superpowers - the United States and China. Notably, China levied a round of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods worth $75 billion in the range of  5-10%  , which was set to be enacted on Sep 1  . This move by China came on the heels of the U.S. government's announcement on Aug 1 that it is imposing a 10% tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods. Though Washington delayed some of those tariffs on Aug 13 stating that those will be enacted in two tranches  on Sep 1 and Dec 15  , respectively, the declaration prompted China to strike back. As a result, after markets closed in the United States on Aug 23, Trump said that he would ""raise tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese exports to  30% from 25% in October  and that the tariffs kicking in next week will now be 15% rather than 10%."" The first lot of those tariffs kicked in this month (read:  Consumer ETFs in Focus on Fresh Tariff Threats  ). However, on China's part, the government finally enacted higher tariffs on Sep 1 on the proportion of goods that only make up ""about one third of the more than 5,000 product lines  listed in the latest announcement."" The majority of the duties will be implemented on Dec 15 and ""China's plans to reinstate tariffs on U.S. autos and auto parts  will also not take place until that time."" Such strained trade ties between the United States and China were sure to hit other emerging economies and their currencies.  Argentina Debt Crisis  Argentina's risk intensified to levels not seen since 2005 after the government announced plans to  protract maturities on about $100 billion in debt  , inducing fears of a massive financial crisis. There was sharp drop in peso due to the debt debacle, which was another reason for the emerging market currency rout. Notably, peso lost about 25% last month.  U.S. Dollar Strength  While emerging market currencies were struggling, the U.S. dollar strengthened. And why not? The U.S. economy has been better-placed in the globe. Though the Fed enacted a 25-bp rate cut in July, it happened after several rate hikes in the recent past.

Currencies of emerging markets witnessed the worst August on record in 2019  , per Bloomberg. WisdomTree Emerging Currency Strategy Fund CEW  lost about 2% in the month  against 1.1% gain of the Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund UUP  . Let's take a look at what led to the slump (read: August ETF Events That Grab Headlines  ).

 Re-escalation of US-China Trade War 

The month saw a spike in the tariff battle between the superpowers - the United States and China. Notably, China levied a round of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods worth $75 billion in the range of  5-10%  , which was set to be enacted on Sep 1  . This move by China came on the heels of the U.S. government's announcement on Aug 1 that it is imposing a 10% tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods.

Though Washington delayed some of those tariffs on Aug 13 stating that those will be enacted in two tranches  on Sep 1 and Dec 15  , respectively, the declaration prompted China to strike back. As a result, after markets closed in the United States on Aug 23, Trump said that he would ""raise tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese exports to  30% from 25% in October  and that the tariffs kicking in next week will now be 15% rather than 10%."" The first lot of those tariffs kicked in this month (read:  Consumer ETFs in Focus on Fresh Tariff Threats  ).

However, on China's part, the government finally enacted higher tariffs on Sep 1 on the proportion of goods that only make up ""about one third of the more than 5,000 product lines  listed in the latest announcement."" The majority of the duties will be implemented on Dec 15 and ""China's plans to reinstate tariffs on U.S. autos and auto parts  will also not take place until that time.""

Such strained trade ties between the United States and China were sure to hit other emerging economies and their currencies.

 Argentina Debt Crisis 

Argentina's risk intensified to levels not seen since 2005 after the government announced plans to  protract maturities on about $100 billion in debt  , inducing fears of a massive financial crisis. There was sharp drop in peso due to the debt debacle, which was another reason for the emerging market currency rout. Notably, peso lost about 25% last month.

 U.S. Dollar Strength 

While emerging market currencies were struggling, the U.S. dollar strengthened. And why not? The U.S. economy has been better-placed in the globe. Though the Fed enacted a 25-bp rate cut in July, it happened after several rate hikes in the recent past. Investors should note that policy tightening gives strength to the concerned currency (read: Dollar Hits 2019 High: More Gains Ahead for ETFs?  ).

2019-09-03 09:49:49,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ) stock was having a fairly good year - until a couple weeks ago. Cisco's fiscal fourth quarter earnings report had some ominous details. The result was that CSCO stock had its biggest drop in about six years - 8.6%. Cisco stock also fell ahead of earnings, for a total drop of 12.3% in two sessions.

Since then, the shares have remained depressed, even though the overall markets have staged a nice rally.

So let's take a look at the quarter. On the positive side of things, CSCO reported its strongest growth on the top line in about six years, with revenues up 6% to $13.4 billion. There was actually strength across all the main businesses like switches, routers and other networking equipment. The security unit also remained strong, with sales up about 14% to $714 million.

In the meantime, CSCO continues to invest heavily in its M&A. The biggest deal was for Acacia Communications (NASDAQ: ACIA ), for $2.6 billion. The company is a fabless semiconductor operator that is focused on high-speed interconnect offerings. The deal certainly looks like a synergistic fit and should help with growth.

There have also been a variety of smaller deals. For example, Cisco has acquired Voicea, which has a real-time transcription service for meetings. Then there was the acquisition of CloudCherry, a provider of technology for customer experience management. At the core of this is advanced predictive analytics and machine learning.

Okay, so why did Wall Street sell off Cisco stock? Well, the guidance was not encouraging. The current quarter is likely to see revenue growth of 0% to 2%, while the Street was looking for 3% (the company does not provide full-year guidance). CSCO also expects earnings to be below forecasts.

As the global economy has come under pressure, Oracle's sales to service providers have decelerated. Let's face it, such purchases can easily be delayed whenever there is economic uncertainty. Keep in mind that other suppliers of large technology equipment - like NetApp (NASDAQ: NTAP ) - have also reported disappointing results.

For CSCO, there could be further problems as competitors like Arista Networks (NYSE: ANET ) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE ) get more aggressive on pricing to pick up new customers In other words, Cisco's margins could be vulnerable.

Next, the situation in China remains a nagging issue. On the earnings call, Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins noted that sales to providers in the country have taken a big hit (down a grueling 25%). Note that it appears that the company is not even being invited to bid on new projects!

It's not clear how long this will last. But given that there has been little substantive progress on trade talks, the problems in China could persist for some time.

With the drop-off in Cisco stock, the valuation is now at reasonable levels. Consider that the forward price-to-earnings ratio is at roughly 13x. The dividend is also an attractive 3%. This is actually among one of the highest in the tech industry.

CSCO also should continue to generate strong cash flows. For fiscal 2019, they came to a hefty $15.8 billion, up 16% on a year-over-year basis. There is about $33.4 billion in the bank.

So for now, there may be a floor on CSCO stock, as the bad news seems to be factored in.  On the other hand though, this does not mean there will be much upside either from current levels.  There are few headwinds on the horizon. Rather, with the global economy in flux, there could easily be some more negative surprises.

So for the time being, there should be no rush to get into CSCO stock.

2019-09-03 13:47:13," Going into 2019, few investors would have guessed that   Kraft Heinz    (NASDAQ: KHC) would see such a drastic decline. Shares of the   packaged-foods giant   fell by 27%    on February 22 when it announced a $15.4 billion impairment   charge that wiped out an otherwise profitable quarter. At the   same time, the company also announced that the   SEC had begun an investigation into its   accounting practices    , specifically calling into question Kraft Heinz's previous   procurement practices. Soon after, the SEC filed an additional   subpoena to investigate Kraft Heinz's goodwill assessments and   asset impairments. While not necessarily related to the $15.4   billion writedown, the news that the SEC is investigating a   company is rarely a good sign in the eyes of   investors. Since then, shares have continued to plummet and   are down 47% from its 2019 high. Over the past few months, investors have continually wondered   whether now is the right time to buy into the stock. While the   fact that Warren Buffet is still holding onto his investment in   Kraft Heinz has helped prevent a massive sell-off, it doesn't   change the fact that investors holding onto its stock have   continued losing money. Certain bulls on Wall Street recommended   Kraft Heinz as a good deal after its stock price plunged. This   hasn't turned out to be the case as in the past month   alone prices have fallen by another 20.7%. Investors now have to ask themselves whether the stock is   getting close to bottoming out or if shares will continue to   fall even more.makeArticleAd();   IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES  Recent financial figures In early August, Kraft Heinz released its   financial results    for the first half of 2019. Operating income fell by 54.6%, while   adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share both dropped by   19.3% and 23.8% respectively compared to the same period last   year. While these figures surpassed analyst expectations, the   main metric where Kraft disappointed shareholders was in sales,   which came in at $12.36 billion. This was a $629 million decline   from the same period last year and was less than the $12.68   billion consensus estimate from Wall Street.   DATA SOURCE: KRAFT HEINZ FINANCIAL REPORT  ""The level of decline we experienced in the first half of this   year is nothing we should find acceptable moving forward,"" said   Kraft Heinz CEO Miguel Patricio in a   press release    in August. ""We have significant work ahead of us to set our   strategic priorities and change the trajectory of our   business."" Potential recovery signs While Kraft Heinz reduced its year-end guidance in light of   these results, there are some early signs of improvement on the   balance sheet. The main silver lining comes from its organic   sales -- sales that are adjusted for currency, divestitures, and   acquisitions - which have begun to stabilize. In comparison to Q1   2019, the decline in organic net sales stabilized in Q2, coming   in at only at loss of 0.3% whereas the full six-month period came   in at a loss of 1.5%. Management also said in their conference call with analysts   the company's sales declined because of trade negotiations in   Europe alongside lower inventory levels in retail locations in   North America. Specifically, Kraft mentioned that 80% of the   decline in organic net sales mentioned above is attributable to   retail inventory reductions in the U.S. and Canada. What this means is that without the decline in retail   inventories and the trade negotiations with Europe, sales might   have even been showing signs of growth. While it's true that   management pulled its guidance, it's also true that there's so   much uncertainty in the markets right now that it makes sense for   Kraft Heinz to cut back on its estimates for the future. Assuming   that inventory stabilizes in the future, Kraft Heinz could see a   surprising increase in sales over the next six to 12 months much   to the surprise of skeptics.   As for the SEC investigation, Kraft Heinz announced in June   that it will restate financial reports for the past three years   to help fix errors due to mistakes by some of its employees.   However, the company said that any misstatements were not   ""quantitatively material,"" and were mostly related to   technicalities surrounding their supplier contracts. So far, an   internal review from the company found   $208 million    worth of adjustments. What should investors do right now? Kraft Heinz is trading at a 7.55 P/E ratio, remarkably cheaper   than competitors like   General Mills    , (NYSE: GIS) which is trading at 18.55 P/E. However, the stock   is cheap for a good reason and even if someone's looking for a   strong dividend stock, there are better alternatives to consider   such as   Nestle    (OTC: NSRGY) or   Kellogg    (NYSE: K) , both companies that have been doing very well so far   in 2019. It's true that there is some potential upside with Kraft   Heinz, but it's not enough to justify a buy right now.

2019-09-03 17:23:00," IPO darling   CrowdStrike Holdings    (NASDAQ: CRWD) has enjoyed a rising stock price, recently   reaching an intraday high of $101.88, up 60% from its market   debut at $63.50 in June. Investors have been attracted to   CrowdStrike for its software-as-a-service (SaaS) cybersecurity   capabilities, which were built from the ground up to support   cloud computing environments. The stock as of this writing trades around $83, having lost   ground as competitors such as   VMware    make moves threatening the company's position. VMware recently   acquired Carbon Black    , which, like CrowdStrike, focuses specifically on endpoint   security. (More on that in a moment.) But at more than 30% above its opening price, does the stock   have room to rise?makeArticleAd();   Image source: Getty Images.   Playing in a red-hot space  Cloud computing has been a hot industry, and it's no surprise   why. The approach allows a company to expand and contract its   need for computing power by accessing remote servers via the   internet (i.e., the cloud). This allows a business to react to   events in real time, like a surge of visitors to its website when   running a sale, which would require increasing the number of   available servers, then reducing costs by turning off these   additional servers when the spike in site visits ends. In this way, corporations can dramatically reduce IT   expenditures. Instead of investing in hardware and software to   support infrastructure, along with hiring staff to set up and   maintain it, businesses can offload these costs to third parties   with expertise in IT infrastructure, such as   Alphabet    ,   Microsoft    , and   Amazon    . The market is expected to continue growing as more companies   migrate their technology to the cloud. Forecasts predict the   cloud computing industry will reach $250 billion next year, an   increase of 17% over this year. Research firm   Gartner    estimates cybersecurity's share of this cloud computing pie will   total $14.1 billion. This market opportunity has led to a deluge of competitors   battling for cybersecurity supremacy. Despite the competition,   CrowdStrike saw revenue grow 103% year-over-year to $96.1 million   in its most recent quarter. Moreover, Gartner listed CrowdStrike   as among the leaders in the space based on its ""completeness of   vision,"" its product offering, and the company's ability to   execute on that vision.  Offering an attractive product  Another advantage is CrowdStrike's compelling product   offering, with its combination of easy setup and   artificial-intelligence-powered security. These two things are a   crucial part of its Falcon platform, a SaaS solution that   monitors all endpoints for its clients. An endpoint is any device   used to connect online. CrowdStrike's ability to monitor all endpoints is important   because we've become   a society of multiple devices    . Gone are the days when an employee accessed company information   only at work. Today, employees are likely to answer company   emails on their own mobile phones or tablets as much as via their   desktop computer in the office. If companies are not monitoring every way an employee accesses   work information, it opens up vulnerabilities that enable   criminals to harm the company. Damages from cybercrime are   estimated to reach $6 trillion by 2021. CrowdStrike's use of AI, through a technique called machine   learning, enables the company's software to identify threats   dynamically. Its system collects data on the devices trying to   access a client's network, and uses it to not only identify   threats but to learn about new threats. This is a key feature   since criminal hackers constantly evolve their attacks. Since   CrowdStrike's AI-powered software can evolve along with the   hackers, it makes CrowdStrike's product more reliable than   traditional security measures offered by competitors like   Symantec    . Another key advantage is the easy setup. While companies like   VMware juggle a hodg-podge of products for clients to implement,   CrowdStrike can get its solution installed and operational on an   endpoint in less than 30 seconds, according to CEO George Kurtz.   This capability helped CrowdStrike grow its customer base nearly   18% in the most recent quarter.  Delivering a proven revenue model  CrowdStike's ability to capture new customers is certainly   important to growing its top line, but its true bread and butter   is its ability to retain and upsell existing customers. Selling   more to existing customers is a much cheaper means of growing   revenue than acquiring new customers. In this arena, CrowdStrike is delivering impressive results.   When it comes to the company's dollar-based net retention rate --   which reveals the percentage of revenue from current customers a   company retained from the prior year after accounting for   upgrades, downgrades, and churn -- CrowdStrike reported a   remarkable 147% through January 2019, easily exceeding its   benchmark of 120%.

IPO darling   CrowdStrike Holdings    (NASDAQ: CRWD) has enjoyed a rising stock price, recently   reaching an intraday high of $101.88, up 60% from its market   debut at $63.50 in June. Investors have been attracted to   CrowdStrike for its software-as-a-service (SaaS) cybersecurity   capabilities, which were built from the ground up to support   cloud computing environments.

The stock as of this writing trades around $83, having lost   ground as competitors such as   VMware    make moves threatening the company's position. VMware recently   acquired Carbon Black    , which, like CrowdStrike, focuses specifically on endpoint   security. (More on that in a moment.)

But at more than 30% above its opening price, does the stock   have room to rise?

Cloud computing has been a hot industry, and it's no surprise   why. The approach allows a company to expand and contract its   need for computing power by accessing remote servers via the   internet (i.e., the cloud). This allows a business to react to   events in real time, like a surge of visitors to its website when   running a sale, which would require increasing the number of   available servers, then reducing costs by turning off these   additional servers when the spike in site visits ends.

In this way, corporations can dramatically reduce IT   expenditures. Instead of investing in hardware and software to   support infrastructure, along with hiring staff to set up and   maintain it, businesses can offload these costs to third parties   with expertise in IT infrastructure, such as   Alphabet    ,   Microsoft    , and   Amazon    .

The market is expected to continue growing as more companies   migrate their technology to the cloud. Forecasts predict the   cloud computing industry will reach $250 billion next year, an   increase of 17% over this year. Research firm   Gartner    estimates cybersecurity's share of this cloud computing pie will   total $14.1 billion.

This market opportunity has led to a deluge of competitors   battling for cybersecurity supremacy. Despite the competition,   CrowdStrike saw revenue grow 103% year-over-year to $96.1 million   in its most recent quarter. Moreover, Gartner listed CrowdStrike   as among the leaders in the space based on its ""completeness of   vision,"" its product offering, and the company's ability to   execute on that vision.

Another advantage is CrowdStrike's compelling product   offering, with its combination of easy setup and   artificial-intelligence-powered security. These two things are a   crucial part of its Falcon platform, a SaaS solution that   monitors all endpoints for its clients. An endpoint is any device   used to connect online.

CrowdStrike's ability to monitor all endpoints is important   because we've become   a society of multiple devices    . Gone are the days when an employee accessed company information   only at work. Today, employees are likely to answer company   emails on their own mobile phones or tablets as much as via their   desktop computer in the office.

If companies are not monitoring every way an employee accesses   work information, it opens up vulnerabilities that enable   criminals to harm the company. Damages from cybercrime are   estimated to reach $6 trillion by 2021.

CrowdStrike's use of AI, through a technique called machine   learning, enables the company's software to identify threats   dynamically. Its system collects data on the devices trying to   access a client's network, and uses it to not only identify   threats but to learn about new threats. This is a key feature   since criminal hackers constantly evolve their attacks. Since   CrowdStrike's AI-powered software can evolve along with the   hackers, it makes CrowdStrike's product more reliable than   traditional security measures offered by competitors like   Symantec    .

Another key advantage is the easy setup. While companies like   VMware juggle a hodg-podge of products for clients to implement,   CrowdStrike can get its solution installed and operational on an   endpoint in less than 30 seconds, according to CEO George Kurtz.   This capability helped CrowdStrike grow its customer base nearly   18% in the most recent quarter.

CrowdStike's ability to capture new customers is certainly   important to growing its top line, but its true bread and butter   is its ability to retain and upsell existing customers. Selling   more to existing customers is a much cheaper means of growing   revenue than acquiring new customers.

In this arena, CrowdStrike is delivering impressive results.   When it comes to the company's dollar-based net retention rate --   which reveals the percentage of revenue from current customers a   company retained from the prior year after accounting for   upgrades, downgrades, and churn -- CrowdStrike reported a   remarkable 147% through January 2019, easily exceeding its   benchmark of 120%. This indicates CrowdStrike is not only   maintaining its spend levels from existing customers, but that   spend is growing.

Since CrowdStrike's products are primarily subscription-based,   its annual recurring revenue (ARR), a key metric for   subscription-based businesses that shows the revenue coming in   each year from subscriptions and indicates what the company can   expect to repeat, is an important indicator of its success. In   Q1, CrowdStrike's ARR grew 114% year-over-year.

Consequently,   non-GAAP    subscription gross margin grew to 73% compared to 62% in the same   quarter last year.

While Q1 results were stellar in many places, operating   expenses need more improvement. The company's Q1 non-GAAP loss   from operations was $22 million, which was an improvement over   last year's Q1 loss of $31 million.

2019-09-03 11:27:11,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

2019 has been a rotten, no-good year for energy stocks. While the stock market as a whole has prospered, energy stocks have missed the boat. The price of crude oil hasn't been particularly favorable and natural gas prices have sunk like a rock. On top of that, investors have been favoring growth while shying away from value stocks. This has left the energy sector orphaned; in fact, energy's share of the S&P 500 has fallen to its lowest level in many years.

For investors willing to buy what others are selling, however, energy stocks offer many rewards here. For one, these are the stocks to buy now if you want strong dividend yields. Across the sector, leading energy firms are offering their highest dividend yields in decades. This, while rates on fixed income in general have plummeted.

Additionally, expect a wave of M&A to help reignite interest in the energy stocks. For example, Blackstone (NYSE: BX ) just announced a takeover for pipeline operator  Tallgrass Energy (NYSE: TGE ). That led to a 35% surge for TGE stock last Wednesday. And as we'll see, that's not the only dealmaking activity going on in the sector right now. With everyone abandoning energy stocks, this could be the time to take advantage of the general pessimism.

Tallgrass wasn't the only company making headlines this week.  BP  (NYSE: BP ) also caused a stir with its announcement that it is selling its Alaskan oil interests to  Hilcorp , a privately-owned company. Hilcorp will pay BP $5.6 billion; $4 billion of that goes to BP immediately, and Hilcorp will deliver the rest gradually in coming years.

It seems that BP drove a fair bargain. Its Alaskan properties produce roughly 74,000 barrels of oil a day, and have been declining in production in recent years. Figuring an average oil price in the low $50s per barrel, Alaska was generating around $1.4 billion annually for BP in revenues. Thus, it sold a mature oil field for around 4x annual revenues, even given the poor industry sentiment at the moment.

Additionally, this sale helps with BP's promised transformation. BP said that it will divest $10 billion in assets as it transitions to more growth and green energy opportunities. With this deal, they have now reached more than half of their overall target.

Management is delivering on its corporate strategy. The asset sales also help strengthen the balance sheet. This should give investors more confidence in BP's gigantic 6.71% dividend yield. In a market starved for yield, it's hard to think BP stock will stay unloved for too long.

Speaking of dividend yields, ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM ) is another income champion that the market is paying no respect right now. ExxonMobil has raised its dividend for 36 consecutive years, making it one of the few companies to manage that feat. Incredibly, it was able to keep raising its dividend even through the oil and gasoline price doldrums in the late 1990s. The great financial crisis didn't break its streak either.

XOM stock is now offering a 5.1% dividend yield. That's amazing; it's the most that ExxonMobil has offered since 1990. Particularly with interest rates plunging ever lower, XOM stock is a fantastic alternative to bank CDs or government bonds yielding 2% or less.

Is the dividend sustainable? Yes. In fact, ExxonMobil still has one of the highest-quality balance sheets in corporate America and is rated a sterling AA+. Even with the slump in oil and natural gas prices, ExxonMobil has still been able to cover its dividend payments out of free cash flow.

And after years of lying low, XOM is pushing the accelerator. It has plans to double its earnings and cash flow over the next five years or so. While the competition has had to retrench due to the slump in energy, ExxonMobil is ready to pick up the slack. With a huge new oil field coming online soon in Guyana, ExxonMobil is prepared for the next decade and more. Throw in any recovery in oil prices, and XOM stock should soar.

A lot of investors, Americans in particular, have some faulty perceptions of the Canadian oil sands. Often disparagingly called ""tar sands,"" oil sands - primarily located in the province of Alberta - are an emerging power play in global crude oil production. Many years ago, this type of production was extremely expensive and damaging to the environment. Over the years, however, operators have gotten much better on both fronts.

Oil sands are now one of the cheapest sources of crude in North America. There's still another issue, however. The oil sands have huge upfront development costs to launch production. That's in stark contrast to, say, fracking another well in the Permian in Texas. Some investors have been put off on oil sands projects because of these capital costs.

Here's the thing they're missing: When you drill a new well in the Permian, for example, most of the production comes within the first couple years. By year ten or so of operation, that well will be kicking out only a few barrels of oil a day. Thus, for frackers, it's a constant and expensive treadmill to keep production rolling. With the oil sands, however, once it's built, you can produce for decades at a low cost. Your production doesn't fall off a cliff - rather you get stable sweet returns for many years.

Suncor (NYSE: SU ) has become the leader in this space in Canada. It has several other attractive features as well. The most important right now is that it is integrated; it has a ton of gasoline refining capacity as well. This allows Suncor to earn far higher prices for its oil than other Western Canadian operators who are dealing with a glut of oil locally.

It's possible that upcoming elections will deliver a more pro-energy government in Canada, making way for more pipelines. Until then, however, Suncor, with its refining and decades of cheap oil reserves, is a standout pick for its refining edge. SU stock currently yields 4.53%, making it one of the better options in the energy stocks space.

Canadian Natural Resources (NYSE: CNQ ) is another big player in oil sands, although it has oil operations around the world in addition to its Canadian holdings.

The firm just made a huge power play, buying up $2.8 billion of oil sands assets from Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN ). This deal appears to have been an absolute steal. Bankers estimated that Devon could fetch up to $5 billion for these assets; Canadian Natural grabbed them for barely half of that.

Canadian Natural doesn't have the same refining capacity as Suncor, however it has a huge asset base and nice diversity across its operations. At a $27 billion market cap, CNQ stock is also a huge player in Canada. When money comes flowing back into Canadian shares and the energy stocks in particular, CNQ stock should catch a solid bid. In the meantime, it also offers a generous 4.88% dividend yield.

Speaking of unloved Canadian stocks, let's turn our attention to pipeline giant  Enbridge (NYSE: ENB ). Enbridge is right up there with  Kinder Morgan (NYSE: KMI ) among the big midstream energy players. Unlike Kinder Morgan, Enbridge is not as popular with American investors; the company doesn't have the same sort of promotional management style you get from Rich Kinder. Nor has Enbridge made a history of big dividend hikes followed by painful dividend cuts.

By contrast, Enbridge has built a reputation for stability, and has become a Canadian blue chip stock. ENB stock offers a current dividend yield of more than 6.5%. And unlike so many energy stocks, Enbridge offers a rock-solid yield. Even despite the difficult operating environment, the company is still able to grow its cash flow by around 5% per year, paving the way for more dividend increases in the future.

Additionally, with 93% of its customers having investment-grade credit ratings, Enbridge has a quality group of clients using its pipelines and thus is largely insulated from more bankruptcies in the E&P space.

Benjamin Graham, who is widely considered to be the ""father of value investing"" recommended an interesting strategy for profits in beaten down sectors. He said investors should look at the industry and find the biggest firm that has a strong balance sheet. That way, you know that your investment will survive the down cycle and perhaps even benefit as smaller competition goes bust. Then, when the cycle turns upward, you'll be poised to capture huge gains.

With oil services,  Schlumberger (NYSE: SLB ) is that company today. Schlumberger has a long and storied history of shareholder value creation. Its stock soared from a split-adjusted $12 in 1995 to as high as $140 in 2014. Since then, with the plunge in oil prices, SLB stock has gotten hammered as well; it's down 75% to around $32 today.

However, much of Schlumberger's competition has already gone bankrupt or is on life support at this point. Meanwhile, Schlumberger remains the global leader in its field, continues to generate profits even during these hard times, and offers a 6.3% dividend yield. When oil booms again, Schlumberger could make it all the way back to its old high of $140 per share; even this past October, it traded at $62, making the current $32 price quite a discount.

You might be asking what a banking stock like Cullen/Frost Bankers (NYSE: CFR ) is doing on a list of energy stocks to buy. That's a fair question. Cullen/Frost, however, is no ordinary bank. It's focused on the Texas economy and has substantial direct exposure to energy loans.

The San Antonio-based bank, in fact, has all 134 of its branches and more than 1,300 ATMs located within Texas. On every earnings call, management devotes substantial time talking about the health of the Texas economy. Given its reliance on energy companies in Houston and fracking in West Texas, the local economy is heavily levered to oil. As a result, investors absolutely pummeled CFR stock in 2015 and 2016 when oil dropped.

CFR stock plummeted from $80 to $45 during that oil crash. Despite that, Cullen/Frost's loan losses barely went up, and the bank came through unscathed. In fact, it has gone through a ton of obstacles without harm; it was the only major Texas bank to survive that state's massive bust in the 1980s oil collapse. On top of that, Cullen/Frost kept raising the dividend even during the financial crisis which took out so many banks. In 2016, after investors gave up on CFR stock, it soared back from $45 to $120 as oil prices normalized.

However, with energy in retreat again, CFR has plunged back to $80 a share. At just 12x forward earnings, it is trading well below its normal valuation. The stock is also yielding more than 3.5%. It could come flying back up in a hurry - as it did in 2017 - once the tide turns for oil, gas, and the Texas economy.

BRUSSELS, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The European Commission on Wednesday will propose financial help for European Union businesses, workers and farmers if Britain crashes out of the bloc without any agreement, a document seen by Reuters said.

British members of parliament on Tuesday triggered a vote that could allow them to stop Prime minister Boris Johnson pursuing a ""no-deal"" Brexit, a challenge that the government warned would prompt the prime minister to seek an election on Oct. 14.

On Wednesday, the EU executive arm will propose, as part of the EU's preparation for the worst ""no-deal"" scenario, using the European Solidarity Fund, normally used to help victims of natural disasters in the EU, to cushion the financial blow for some EU countries most exposed to trade with Britain.

The Commission also wants to use the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, created to help EU workers who lose jobs due to globalisation, to be used for those dismissed after a ""no-deal"" crashing out, the document said.

The Commission, which is in charge of managing Britain's already twice-delayed exit from the bloc, will also propose to use all existing instruments for market support and direct financial support to EU farmers to the mitigate worst impacts of a no-deal on food markets.

The EU's state aid rules, regulating how governments can help companies, ""offered flexible solutions for national support measures"" for smaller EU companies with large exposure to Britain, in case of a no-deal, it said.

The Commission will say that it was still working with Ireland to find a way to avoid building a physical border on the island of Ireland and at the same time protect the EU single market under a no-deal scenario.

But it also said that the only way to do that was to use the existing solution of the ""Irish backstop"" in the withdrawal agreement negotiated with the EU by Britain's previous government, and thrice since rejected the British parliament.

The Commission will reiterate that a divorce between Britain and the EU without a deal would have a serious negative economic impact on both, but much greater on Britain. Nor would there be any transition period for economies to prepare and adjust.

The Commission will say that if London were to choose the no-deal option, the EU would only be ready to discuss future ties with Britain once it addressed the issue of the rights of EU citizens who arrived in Britain before Brexit. These are now regulated by the withdrawal agreement rejected by British MPs.

The United Kingdom would also have to honour its financial obligations to the EU, and preserve the Good Friday Agreement that brought peace to the island of Ireland after decades of sectarian violence.

Britain would also have to preserve the integrity of the EU single market, the Commission will say. Both issues have been dealt with in the rejected divorce agreement.

To facilitate expert advice and coordination among EU governments in case of a no-deal Brexit, the Commission will set up a call centre and a hotline telephone number available in all 27 EU countries and all EU languages.","EU to help its firms, workers, farmers in case of no-deal Brexit - doc - Nasdaq.com",https://www.nasdaq.com/article/eu-to-help-its-firms-workers-farmers-in-case-of-nodeal-brexit--doc-20190903-01206

2019-09-04 16:50:00,"Sept 4 (Reuters) - Slack Technologies Inc  forecast a bigger-than-expected loss for the third quarter on Wednesday, as the workplace messaging and communication platform invests heavily to attract paid customers and organizations in the face of competition from companies like Microsoft Corp .

Shares of the company tumbled 15% in extended trading.

The company forecast a third-quarter loss of between 9 cents and 8 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting a loss of 7 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Slack went public via a direct listing on June 20, instead of the more popular initial public offering route. Its shares soared nearly 50% in their public trading debut, valuing it at more than $23 billion. 

Slack, however, topped second-quarter revenue expectations and posted a smaller-than-expected loss. The company posted revenue of $145 million, beating estimates of $141.3 million, driven by paid customer growth.

Its adjusted loss of 14 cents per share was smaller than the 18 cents analysts had expected.

The company's total operating expenses in the quarter surged 317.6% to $477.5 million.

JD.com (NYSE: JD ) reported its second-quarter earnings August 13. They were better than expected sending JD stock up by more than 8% on the news. Unfortunately, it's gone sideways ever since. 

JD traded at $50 as recently as January 2018. It fell all the way to $19 that year on allegations CEO and founder Richard Liu raped a 21-year-old student in Minnesota . Although charges were never laid, JD stock's never fully recovered from the fallout. And the trade war between the U.S. and China didn't help its cause. 

As for the business, the latest quarterly results suggest it is starting to turn the corner. However, despite the positive earnings surprise and being up 47% year to date through August 29, JD stock's gotten stuck at $30.

So, investors are left wondering if JD.com is a $30 or a $50 stock. Here are my arguments for both stock prices.

InvestorPlace contributor Laura Hoy recently wrote that JD's work to build its logistics work is starting to pay off for the company as it gets higher-margin, third-party e-commerce revenues. Furthermore, as the company's gotten involved in the digital advertising space, margins have jumped higher. 

One only needs to look at the growth Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is experiencing from its foray into digital advertising to know that it's a lucrative endeavor. eMarketer estimates that Amazon's U.S. ad business will grow 53% in 2019 to $11.3 billion. 

So, what's JD.com's ad business look like at the moment?

JD doesn't separate its ad revenue. It's included with the fees the company generates from third-party sellers using its marketplaces. In the first six months of 2019, marketplace and advertising revenues were $2.8 billion , 25% higher than a year earlier. 

During its Q2 2019 conference call, CFO Sidney Huang did say that the company's 42% increase in net service revenues during the quarter were ""driven by strong momentum from third-party logistics and advertising revenues.""

Although its net services revenue only accounted for 11.2% of its overall revenue, the margins are much higher than those for its own ecommerce sales. 

More importantly, a number of analysts were asking questions about its advertising business during the Q&A after the conference call. You can be sure that they will continue to pester the company for greater detail. Investors should continue to pay attention to this aspect of its business. 

Like Amazon, it will be bigger than most realize. 

One of the reasons I prefer Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) over JD is because of the free cash flow it generates.

Well, in the first six months of the year, JD had $2.8 billion in free cash flow on $39.5 billion in revenue for an FCF margin of 7.1%. In Alibaba's first quarter ended June 30, it had free cash flow of $3.8 billion on revenue of $16.7 billion for an FCF margin of 22.8%. 

Clearly, JD can't hold a candle to Alibaba, but if it continues to grow the services side of its business, I could see the gap tightening. 

JD's headed in the right direction.

JD is making headway in its business. There's no question. However, the volatility of its free cash flow makes its stock awfully difficult to commit to. 

In the second quarter, JD had a 40% increase in its free cash flow to $2.7 billion . That's an impressive figure. What you might not notice about the jump in free cash flow is that a big chunk of it came from the sale of some of its logistics and real estate properties. Otherwise, its free cash flow wouldn't have been nearly as high. 

Until JD generates consistent free cash flow, its stock isn't nearly as attractive as BABA's. That's especially true if the trade war drags on well into 2020. 

Other than its inconsistent free cash flow generation, there's very little to say that's negative about JD.com. 

InvestorPlace's Will Healy recently stated that JD has tested $26 twice this summer. On both occasions, it's bounced higher. He believes you should wait for a third-time lucky. 

I believe he's right. 

Is JD a $30 or $50 stock?

It's a $50 stock disguised as a $30 stock. Once a trade agreement is reached, $50 will be easy pickings.

At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-03 12:46:00,"August was a turbulent month in the stock market, and the ongoing trade war between the United States and China was the main reason. New tariffs were announced, both the new and the previously existing tariffs were subsequently increased, China retaliated with tariffs of its own, and President Trump went so far as to encourage American companies who do business with China to start looking for alternatives.

There has been a lot to keep up with, so here's a quick rundown of the most recent developments, why a trade deal could finally happen, and who the biggest winners could be if it does.

Image source: Getty Images.

The most significant developments that have occurred recently in the trade war all stem from President Trump's latest round of tariffs.

In a surprise announcement, the president announced on August 1 a 10% tariff on the $300 billion in Chinese imports that had thus far been unaffected by the trade war. This was initially set to go into effect on September 1, one month after the announcement.

Well, a lot happened in that month.

First, China retaliated with tariffs of its own. They are smaller in scale than the U.S. tariffs -- 5% to 10% on about $75 billion in U.S. exports. However, in response to this retaliation, President Trump decided that the recently announced tariffs would be 15%, not 10%. And the 25% tariffs currently in place on $250 billion in Chinese imports would rise to 30% on October 1. 

Then, in an effort to minimize effects on the U.S. holiday shopping season, about half of the new 15% tariffs were delayed until December 15. This affects about $160 billion of the $300 billion in Chinese imports Trump referenced in his original announcement.

The latest tariffs went into effect on September 1. The 15% tariffs have now been imposed on about $112 billion of Chinese imports. This is in addition to tariffs that were already in place, and China retaliated with tariffs of its own of 5%-10% on about $75 billion of U.S. exports. 

These tariffs are particularly significant because they affect more consumer items than previous rounds. The Trump administration had largely focused the earlier tariffs in ways that would be least likely to affect retail goods.

Finally, on August 23 President Trump also (via Twitter) ordered American businesses to ""immediately start looking for an alternative to China.""

In short, August was an eventful month for the trade war. It was also the main driving force behind the continuous stock market volatility during the month.

One positive development in the trade war saga is that China seems to be indicating that it wants to make a deal without further hostility, saying that it seeks a ""calm"" end to the trade tensions. This news came after the president ordered American businesses to find alternatives to China, but before the latest round of tariffs went into effect. 

President Trump later said that Chinese officials had reached out to the U.S. and expressed interest in getting back to the negotiating table.

Obviously, the entire U.S. stock market would breathe a collective sigh of relief if a trade deal were to be reached. The exact market reaction to a hypothetical end to the trade war is anyone's guess at this point, but it's fair to assume that most major market indices would likely move higher at the news.

The biggest direct winners of a trade deal would likely be those stocks and sectors that have been most adversely affected. For example, electronics manufacturers like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , which relies on China for much of its supply chain.

Other sectors could be indirect winners, such as the financial sector . As the trade war has escalated, it has added to recession fears in the market, which has driven interest rates lower. Lower interest rates generally translate to lower profit margins for banks, so a trade deal could lift market sentiment, which in turn could cause interest rates (and bank stocks) to rise.

If no trade deal, or at least significant progress, is announced when leaders from the U.S. and China meet, I'd expect a negative reaction from the stock market. Any further announcements of tariffs or other action from either side would be even worse. I'd expect companies and sectors that do the most business with China to be affected most, but an ongoing trade war could be a big negative catalyst for the market, especially if it leads to a recession.

FRANKFURT, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Germany's central bank does not want banks banned from charging retail customers negative interest rates to improve profitability, an official said.

Joachim Wuermeling, a member of the board of the Bundesbank, told Reuters that consumers should be protected but that banks must have leeway to manage their costs.

Bavaria's premier Markus Soeder has suggested banks be prohibited from charging retail customers negative interest rates for accounts of less than 100,000 euros($111,440.00).

""If banks were forbidden from charging negative interest rates, they would lack a possible instrument to be profitable,"" said Wuermeling, who is responsible for banking supervision on the Bundesbank's executive board.

Profitability was an important buffer for the financial system and helped foster investment, he said.

Since 2014, the European Central Bank has charged lenders to store their cash, with the so-called deposit rate currently at minus 0.4%.

Banks in Germany paid 2.4 billion euros to the central bank to hold cash in 2018, the German government said in response to a parliamentary inquiry on negative interest rates.

Some banks have passed along that cost to their corporate and wealthy clients, but banks have so far shied away from charging regular savers.

CARACAS, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Gold reserves held by Venezuela's central bank fell by $1 billion in the first half of 2019, official data released this week showed, amid opposition accusations that the government is selling the precious metal abroad to raise revenue in the face of U.S. sanctions.

The value of the gold bars in central bank vaults fell to $4.62 billion, down 18.5% from $5.67 billion dollars at the end of 2018 - the lowest in 75 years, according to bank data.

The drop corresponds to a decline of 26.36 tons of gold from reserves, leaving the bank with about 102.40 tons. About one-third of that is held by the Bank of England.

Ruling Socialist Party officials accuse the Bank of England of refusing to repatriate the gold due to sanctions. The Bank of England has declined to comment, citing internal policy.

Venezuela's central bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Last year, Maduro's government began exporting gold produced by informal miners in the southern jungles to Turkey for the first time. The value of central bank gold had already fallen by $1 billion in the second half of 2018, according to bank reserves.

Despite Trump administration sanctions and pressure on traders not to buy Venezuelan gold, more than 16 tons of it left bank vaults for unknown destinations, according to legislators and officials of the Maduro government. 

Two government sources indicated this week that the bank has again started taking gold out of coffers in August, adding that soldiers have been posted at the bank's headquarters in the last two months in an unusual stepping of security.

The sources did not specify the volume of gold that could leave the bank.",Venezuela gold reserves drop by $1 bln in first half 2019 - Nasdaq.com,https://www.nasdaq.com/article/venezuela-gold-reserves-drop-by-1-bln-in-first-half-2019-20190903-00923

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features updated research reports on 16 major stocks, including AT&T (T), Thermo Fisher (TMO) and Schwab (SCHW). These research reports have been hand-picked from roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.

AT&T 's shares have gained +10.7% over the past year, outperforming the Zacks Wireless National industry's increase of +7.7%. AT&T is improving critical services that support Public Safety and first responders using the FirstNet communications platform.

The wireless carrier's LTE network reaches more than 400 million people in North America. It aims to deploy a standards-based, nationwide mobile 5G network in early 2020. AT&T's 5G Evolution technology is live in more than 200 markets, and is expected to reach more than 400 markets by the end of 2019. It is on track to achieve its target of 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA range by 2019.

However, the Zacks analyst thinks the company is witnessing a steady decline in linear TV subscribers and legacy services. Its wireline division is facing loss in access line due to competitive pressure from Voice over Internet Protocol service providers. As the company tries to woo customers with discounts, freebies and cash credits, margin pressures tend to soar.

(You can  read the full research report on AT&T here >>> ).

Shares of Thermo Fisher have outperformed the Zacks Medical Instruments industry in the past three months (+7.1% vs. +5.6%). The Zacks analyst thinks Thermo Fisher has recently been demonstrating strength in all end markets categorized by customer type or geography. In the second quarter, the company registered solid international performance with growth in Europe and Asia-Pacific including China.

A series of product launches aided its performance. The company's recent purchase of Brammer Bio in the field of Gene and Cell Therapy is a major positive. Thermo Fisher's Specialty Diagnostics business, even in the face of the divestment of its anatomical pathology unit, holds immense potential.

The company's raised 2019 guidance looks encouraging. On the flip side, Thermo Fisher's operating segments are getting impacted by unfavorable business mix. Competitive headwinds and escalating costs pose threat.

(You can  read the full research report on Thermo Fisher here >>> ).

Schwab 's shares have underperformed the Zacks Investment Brokers industry over the past six months, declining -16.2% vs. -7.5%. However, the Zacks analyst thinks the company has a decen t earnings surprise history. Its earnings have surpassed expectations in three of the trailing four quarters.

The company's planned acquisition of USAA's Investment Management Company, efforts to strengthen trading business and improvement in operating efficiency bode well for the future. Additionally, the company's steady capital deployment actions are commendable and are expected to continue to enhance shareholder value.

Nevertheless, a dismal rate scenario remains a major concern for the company and will likely hamper margin and top-line growth in the upcoming quarters. Rising operating expenses (mainly related to compensation costs and regulatory charges) are likely to hurt bottom-line growth to some extent.

NEW YORK, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Wall Street lost ground and the U.S. dollar strengthened to its highest level in more than two years on Tuesday as trade worries persisted and U.S. factory activity entered contraction territory for the first time since February 2016.

As new tariffs on Chinese goods went into effect over the U.S. Labor Day weekend, market participants are apparently losing faith that the world's two largest economies will reach a near-term resolution to their long-running trade war, which has rattled markets for months and weighed on world economies.

""Any possible optimism regarding the trade talks (was) dashed by this ISM number, which showed a contraction in factory activity,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York.

""There's optimism that the U.S. will weather the storm with help from the Fed,"" Ghriskey added. ""But weakness in manufacturing seems to be persistent. This wasn't a fluke report.""

The Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 340.49 points, or 1.29%, to 26,062.79, the S&P 500  lost 22.79 points, or 0.78%, to 2,903.67 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 67.90 points, or 0.85%, to 7,894.99.

European shares fell for the first time in four sessions on Tuesday, as uncertainty over a looming no-deal Brexit and lingering U.S.-China trade tensions dampened investor optimism. 

The pan-European STOXX 600 index  lost 0.38% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe  shed 0.56%.

Trade concerns also dampened emerging markets. 

Emerging market stocks lost 0.89%. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan  closed 0.75% lower, while Japan's Nikkei  rose 0.02%.

Trade and Brexit concerns drove the dollar, against a basket of major world currencies, to its highest level since mid-May 2017, and sent the Euro plunging to a 28-month low versus the greenback. 

The dollar index  rose 0.07%, with the euro  up 0.05% to $1.0972.

The Japanese yen strengthened 0.32% versus the greenback at 105.89 per dollar, while Sterling  was last trading at $1.2068, up 0.02% on the day.

U.S. Treasury yields fell, with the benchmark 10-year yield at its lowest since July 2016 following the downbeat ISM report and worries about a weakening global economy in the face of the U.S.-China trade war. 

Benchmark 10-year notes  last rose 17/32 in price to yield 1.4489%, down from 1.506% late on Friday.

The 30-year bond  last rose 34/32 in price to yield 1.9281%, down from 1.973% late on Friday.

Rising OPEC and Russian production, combined with demand concerns due to a global economic slowdown dragged down oil prices. 

U.S. crude  fell 3.39% to $53.23 per barrel and Brent  was last at $57.60, down 1.81% on the day.

Cable dropped to multi-month lows hitting 1.1958 in the morning London dealing on market fears that Boris Johnson may call an early election if Parliament votes to reject the no-deal Brexit path that he has promised voters.

The chaos of early Parliamentary elections would only add to the uncertainty surrounding the situation in the UK especially given the fact that Tories lead by 9% in the polls and could, in fact, create a majority rule that would give them a path to no Brexit deal.

The political realities, however, are likely to be far messier especially if Liberal Democrats stage a comeback as the clear anti-Brexit thwarting a full-on Tory takeover. Regardless of the scenarios, political uncertainty is sure to take its toll on the UK economy.

UK data continues to show deterioration with both Manufacturing and Construction PMIs sinking deeper into recession territory. Tomorrow's UK PMI Services report will be crucial to market sentiment if it too drops below the 50 boom/bust line.

Services are the biggest component of the UK economy and if the sector contracts for the first time since the referendum vote 3 years ago, the political damage to Mr. Johnson could be substantial. For now, the focus will squarely on Westminster as markets await the outcome of Parliament proceedings later today.

Elsewhere RBA kept rates on hold as expected at 1.00% and kept its statement surprisingly upbeat offering no clues that it may cut rates further in the very near future. For now, the RBA appears to be content to remain in neutral mode reserving what ammunition it has left for more difficult times. It seemed particularly focused on the state of employment which remained surprisingly robust given the global trade tensions and it appears that the central bank will not move to cut rates further unless labor conditions deteriorate,

All of this left Aussie bit stronger on the day as the unit bounced from .6678 lows to trade .6725 by EU mid-morning. The pair continues to find support at the .6700 level where it has been basing for more than a month and any positive news in US-China trade negotiations could quickly push it to .6800.

2019-09-03 08:46:15,"Overview:  A showdown between UK Prime Minister Johnson and Parliament over Brexit pushed sterling below $1.20.  The euro is extended its losses after finishing last week below $1.10.  Growth concerns are seeing equities retreat.  Japanese and Chinese shares managed to eke out gains, but the Asia Pacific and European stocks have been sold.  The Dow Jones Stoxx 600 has been turned back from key target reached yesterday and is snapping a three-day advance today.  US shares are trading heavily in Europe, and the S&P 500 may open more than 0.8% lower.  Benchmark 10-year yields are falling three-six basis points today, with some European bonds, like Germany, Netherlands, and Italy falling to new record lows.  The dollar is broadly higher against most major and emerging market currencies.  Although the Swiss National Bank does not appear to have intervened last week, the franc's safe-haven status pales compared with the Japanese yen. The yen is posting minor gains today, and the Australian dollar is also resisting greenback strength following news of its first current account surplus in a generation.  Among emerging markets, the lower than expected CPI is spurring talk that Turkey has scope to cut rates again next week, and this is seeing some demand for the lira.      

Asia Pacific

China continues to resist pressure on the yuan.  The PBOC's dollar reference rate was set at CNY7.0884 vs. CNY7.0883 on Monday.  Bank models had it closer to CNY7.1040.  The dollar approached CNH7.1965, but participants pulled back from testing CNH7.20 for fear of triggering a more aggressive response by officials.  Some are rolling positions into options, favoring CNH7.25 and CNH7.35 strikes.  A couple of large US banks are forecasting CNY7.50 by year-end. 

The Reserve Bank of Australia as widely expected left the cash rate at 1.0% today.  Many expect a rate cut in Q4 19 and another in Q1 19.   Separately, Australia reported a decline in July retail sales and its first quarterly current account surplus in nearly 45 years.   Retail sales fell 0.1%.  The median forecast was for a 0.2% gain after a 0.4% rise in June.  Australia recorded an A$5.9 bln current account surplus in Q2, which was nearly four times larger than expected.  The Q1 deficit was revised from a nearly A$3 bln deficit to an A$1.1 bln shortfall. 

South Korea shaved its Q2 GDP to 1.0% from 1.1% and reported half the gain expected in August CPI, pushing the year-over-year rate to zero.  In July it was at 0.6%.  The base effect with a 0.2% month-over-month rise weighed on the measure.  The core rate slipped to 0.9% from 1.0%.  The central bank does not meet until the middle of next month.  Its key policy rate (seven-day repo) is at 1.5%.  The July cut unwound the hike from last November.  Another cut looks likely.  

The dollar has been confined to yesterday's range against the yen (~JPY105.90-JPY106.40).  There are $1.3 bln in expiring options struck at JPY106.15-JPY106.20.  The greenback's lows were recorded in the European morning, and the intraday technicals suggest scope for a recovery in the North American morning.  The Australian dollar slipped through $0.6700 but recovered and now faces resistance in the $0.6735-$0.6740 area.  Here the intraday technical readings warn that the cap may hold.  Indian stocks came under pressure following disappointing GDP figures last week, and the rupee is making new lows for the year against the dollar.  

Europe

The battle lines are drawn in the UK.   The House of Commons will consider a bill to request a three-month delay of Brexit if a deal is not agreed upon by mid-October.  Prime Minister Johnson recognizes this as an attempt to prevent a no-deal Brexit.  Johnson says the EU will capitulate when it sees that nothing will stop the UK from leaving at the end of next month.  However, thus far, the EC has shown no real signs of wavering.  Johnson threatens that if the government loses today's vote, tomorrow he will call a snap election (October 14).  However, the rub is that it is no longer within the PM's power to call an election and he would need 2/3 of the House of Commons or 434 votes to do so.  The Tories have 311 MPs assuming none are forced out of the party as Johnson has threatened over today's vote.  

Italy's political storm, triggered by the League's withdrawal of from the government, maybe nearly over.  Prime Minister Conte may have succeeded in forging a new coalition.  This one, between the Five Star Movement and the Democrat Party, seems almost as unwieldy as the last one, but their common hostility to Salvini may be sufficient allow the country to move forward on the 2020 budget and some political reforms.  With a little bit of luck, the worst economic news may be behind it.  Tomorrow, Italy reports the August composite PMI.  It may have slipped after rising to 51.0 in July from, its third monthly increase.  The composite bottomed last October-November at 49.3.  It was still below the 50 boom/bust level in May. 

Turkey reported a larger than expected decline in inflation, and this is fueling expectations for another large rate cut.  August CPI fell to 15.01% from 16.65% in July.  The core rate fell to 13.6% from 16.2%.  The one-week repo rate stands at 19.75% following the 425 bp cut in July.  The base effect suggests further declines are likely in the coming months.  The central bank projects it will end the year a little below 14%, but this may be a conservative estimate.  The central bank meets on September 12, and a 200-300 bp rate cut is possible.  

The euro closed last week below $1.10 and has been unable to resurface above there yesterday or today.  It fell to almost $1.0930 in Asia before steadying and reached $1.0950 in the European morning.  There are nearly two bln euros in options struck at $1.0945-$1.0950 that will expire later today but are very much in play now.  The $1.10 level has a 2.3 bln euro option strike that also will be cut,, though it seems safe.  The break of $1.10 suggests the next target is near $1.08.  There is a gap from April 2017 that is bound between roughly $1.0780 and $1.0820 that may attract prices.  Sterling has been battered through $1.20.  The next target is the flash crash low from October 2016, for which there is some disagreement on the exact level it reached.  Bloomberg has it near $1.1840.  There is an option for GBP270 mln at $1.20 that expires today.  

America

The US reports the August manufacturing PMI and ISM today alongside July construction spending.  While there may be some headline risk, the focus is on tomorrow's auto sales report and Fed's Beige Book, followed by the employment data at the end of the week.  The market has no doubt that the Fed will deliver its second rate cut of the year at the conclusion of its meeting on September 18.  However, CME's model suggests less than a 3% chance of a 50 bp, while the Bloomberg model puts it at a nearly 20% chance.  Subjectively, we suspect there is little chance of a 50 bp move, given the Fed's rhetoric and the still above-trend growth, full employment, and some acceleration in prices recently.  There are at least seven Fed officials speaking in the coming days, beginning with Rosengren, one of two dissents from the decision to cut rates in July, and ending with a speech by Powell in Switzerland ahead of the weekend. 

Canada reports August manufacturing PMI today, but the focus is on tomorrow Bank of Canada meeting.  The cash rate is expected to remain steady at 1.75%, but speculation has mounted in recent weeks for an October 30 cut (~55% chance appears discounted in the derivatives market).  To validate the speculation, the Bank of Canada will have to soften its neutral stance.   Canada also reports its August employment data ahead of the weekend, and a bounce back after a soft July is anticipated.  Canada's national election will be held on October 21.  

The US dollar is looking to extend its seven-week rally against the Canadian dollar.  It rose in quiet trade yesterday and is rising further today.  Indeed, the greenback is at its best level since mid-June today near CAD1.3365.  This area corresponds to a retracement objective and suggests the next target is in the CAD1.3400-CAD1.3435 area.  Support now is seen in the CAD1.3315 area.  Mexico has a light calendar this week.  The dollar has risen against the peso for the past seven weeks as well.  Yesterday and so far today it is trading within the range seen before the weekend of roughly MXN20.00-MXN20.20.  Today bids are being found near the midpoint of the range.  The high from last December was set near MXN20.65.  The Dollar Index rose 1.3% last week, the most in since mid-June 2018.  It tested 99.00 ahead of the weekend and is now near 99.35.  The next target is 100.00-100.15.

2019-09-03 16:13:00,"ISTANBUL, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday that a so-called de-escalation zone in Syria's Idlib region is slowly disappearing because of military attacks by government forces.

Erdogan also said he would make all necessary contacts with parties in the region to find a solution to the Idlib situation, adding that a Syria safe zone which he has proposed to host Syrians fleeing the war is now nothing more than a name.

""Idlib is slowly disappearing. Idlib is in a situation that it started to disappear and become torn down in a way Aleppo is. It is not possible to stay silent against this,"" Erdogan told a news conference in Ankara.

Turkey, Russia and Iran agreed in 2017 to the Idlib zone to reduce fighting, although the terms were never made public and the deal did not include jihadist groups.

On Saturday, the U.S. Central Command, part of the Department of Defense, said U.S. forces struck an al-Qaeda facility in Idlib in an attack aimed at the organisation's leadership. 

Erdogan said that Idlib would be the most important issue during his meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump as part of the United Nations General Assembly later in September.

A proposed safe area in northern Syria to host Syrians fleeing the war and also refugees living in Turkey is nothing more than a name right now, Erdogan said. The idea was not supported by some allies, he said.

""Safe zone is nothing more than a name right now. Some assaults, threats are made in the southern part but we are taking all the necessary steps,"" Erdogan said.",Turkish President Erdogan says Syria's Idlib slowly disappearing - Nasdaq.com,https://www.nasdaq.com/article/turkish-president-erdogan-says-syrias-idlib-slowly-disappearing-20190903-01200

2019-09-03 09:10:00,"Sept 3 (Reuters) - The singer Ariana Grande has sued Forever 21 for $10 million, accusing the clothing retailer of trademark infringement for stealing her name and likeness to promote its products and a beauty company started by its founders' daughters.

In a complaint filed in Los Angeles federal court on Monday, Grande accused Forever 21 and the Riley Rose beauty company of publishing at least 30 unauthorized images and videos misappropriating her name, image, likeness and music to confuse consumers into thinking she endorsed them.

Grande said this followed the February breakdown of talks to create a joint marketing campaign because Forever 21 would not pay enough.

Let's take a quick look at the fund and the near-term outlook on it to get a better idea on where it might be headed:   SPLV in Focus    This ETF provides exposure to stocks with the lowest realized volatility over the past 12 months. It has a well-diversified portfolio with key holdings in utilities, financials and real estate. The fund charges 25 bps in annual fees (read: all the Large Cap Blend ETFs here  ).   Why the Move?    The low-volatility corner of the broader market has been an area to watch lately given the heightened market volatility due to U.S.-China trade gyrations. This is because these products have the potential to outpace the broader market in bearish conditions or in an uncertain environment, providing significant protection to the portfolio. The low-volatility funds include more stable stocks that have experienced the least price movement in their portfolio. Further, these are allocated primarily to defensive sectors that usually have a higher distribution yield than the broader markets.   More Gains Ahead?    Currently, SPLV has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook. Therefore, it is hard to get a handle on its future returns one way or the other. However, many of the segments that make up this ETF have a strong Zacks Industry Rank. So, there is definitely some promise for those who want to ride this surging ETF a little further.

The company's earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average being 72.6%.  Past-Quarter Performance  In the las t report  ed quarter, Guidewire delivered non-GAAP earnings of 18 cents per share, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 8 cents. Notably, the bottom line also improved from the year-ago quarter's figure of 5 cents per share. The company reported revenues of $162.9 million, surging 15% from the year-ago quarter.

2019-09-03 09:49:00,"By Carolyn Cohn and Lena Masri

LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Big insurance losses from hurricanes, wildfires and other natural disasters over the past two years are set to push reinsurance renewal rates higher in January, ratings agencies said.

After falling for several years due to competition and fewer natural disasters, renewal rates have started to climb in the past couple of years and for 2020 are set to rise on average by as much as 5%.

S&P said rates would likely rise by around 5%, Moody's expected rises of 0-5%, while Fitch predicted 1-2%, in briefings ahead of the reinsurance industry's annual conference in Monte Carlo which begins on Saturday.

Reinsurers such as Swiss Re , Munich Re  and the Lloyd's of London  market help insurers share the risks of disasters in return for part of the premium.

""It's not a hard market but it's a hardening market, there's more positive momentum,"" Ali Karakuyu, lead analyst at S&P Global, told a media briefing.

Fellow analyst David Masters said the industry was likely to see ""mid-single digit price increases"" as a result.

Insurers are increasingly concerned about the impact of bad weather linked to climate change, with an increase in wildfires in California among the most costly in recent years, something S&P said could see rates there jump 30-70%.

""This market remains in disarray, which will fuel further rate increases,"" a slide from the S&P presentation said.

Analysts at UBS estimated that the reinsurance industry is in an excess capital position of around $30 billion, but that an estimated $70 billion of natural catastrophe losses in 2019 could erode this excess capital.

Moody's analysts said lines of business that have been performing badly over the last few years, for example due to losses related to hurricanes in the United States, would see price rises in the mid-teens.

Fitch Senior Director Graham Coutts said he expected average rates to rise 1-2%, similar to the increases seen in January 2019, although further rises could be seen depending on the scale of losses from Dorian and other hurricanes.",Catastrophes set to drive 2020 reinsurance rates higher - Nasdaq.com,https://www.nasdaq.com/article/catastrophes-set-to-drive-2020-reinsurance-rates-higher-20190903-00817
2019-09-03 08:18:00,"You've been at your job for a while now, and you're reasonably content. You like the company, your colleagues are great, the compensation is good, and the benefits are outstanding. There's just one problem: You're bored more often than you'd like to be.

If that's the case, you're in good company. An OfficeTeam survey released in late 2017 found that employees are bored at work for 10.5 hours a week on average. In the course of a 40-hour workweek, that means employees spend roughly a quarter of their time uninterested in what they're doing.

The problem with too much on-the-job boredom is that it can hurt your outlook and zap your motivation. Once that happens, your performance might decline, and your career might take a nasty hit to follow. Not good.

Image source: Getty Images.

A better solution is to be proactive about making your job more exciting. Here's how.

Many jobs lead to repetition -- you're hired to do a specific set of tasks, and so you spend your days focused on them without much reprieve. After awhile, that can get old. If you've been growing increasingly bored at work, try shaking things up with a new project. The tricky thing is that you'll likely need to come up with an idea yourself. But if you present that idea and it's approved, you'll probably get first dibs on the initiative in question, which will give you something engaging to do.

Maybe you're itching to be assigned more-interesting tasks at work. To get there, you'll need to prove to your manager that you can handle them. Growing your skills could therefore be your ticket to less boredom and more satisfaction, so think about the areas you're lacking in and work on them. For example, if you're not great with attention to detail, your boss might hesitate to assign high-profile projects to you. But if you shape up in that regard, you might start getting those more-desirable assignments.

The same holds true for skills that are specific to your job. Learning a new project management program, for example, could be just the thing that prompts your boss to choose you when the next big initiative kicks off.

Chances are, your boss isn't a mind reader. If you're bored at work but don't let on about it to avoid coming off as a complainer, your manager won't be able to help you. The answer: Speak up. Schedule a meeting with your boss, explain how you've been feeling, and ask for an opportunity to do a few different things. Be ready to propose a few new tasks to add to your plate, and also go in with a compelling argument for unloading some of the work you've grown to detest, so that the burden isn't entirely on your manager.

",Here's Why The Medicines Company Stock Soared Again on Tuesday - Nasdaq.com,https://www.nasdaq.com/article/heres-why-the-medicines-company-stock-soared-again-on-tuesday-cm1206976
2019-09-03 15:48:15,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Tuesday marked the first trading session of September, as well as the first session in the holiday-shortened week, with U.S. equity markets closed on Monday in observance of Labor Day. It wasn't an easy session for traders to get reacquainted with though. Let's look at a few top stock trades.

Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) stock have been moving really well and even on Tuesday, the early price action looked promising. Shares were trying to breakout of an ascending triangle, a bullish setup where rising uptrend support continues to squeeze a stock against a static level of resistance.

That resistance came into play around $43. The stock was swiftly rejected from this level while the broader market was under notable pressure.

However, uptrend support (blue line) is still holding strong, while the 20-day moving average is just below current levels.

If these marks give way, $40 is on the table. A move over $43 could still trigger a breakout, but TWTR needs to close over this level.

Walmart (NYSE: WMT ) stock also continues to trade relatively well so far this month. However, the stock continues to struggle with this $114 to $115 level.

In the last two months, WMT has found itself in this area on three separate occasions. Each test of $115 comes following a higher low, as highlighted by the purple arrows on the chart above.

If the overall market falls apart, it will be harder for WMT stock to breakout. However, shares are sitting rightunder the trigger spot. A close over $115 could cause an even larger move to the upside, with $120 on many traders' radar.

On the downside, I would really like to see the 20-day and 50-day moving averages hold as support.

Cleveland Cliffs (NYSE: CLF ) is getting hammered on the day, falling about 15% on Tuesday. It's more than just a tough day though, as CLF falls below its 200-week moving average.

Should CLF reclaim this area and hold it by Friday's close, bulls can breathe a sigh of relief. However, a close below this mark puts the $6 mark on the table for the struggling stock.

Shares were putting in a series of lower highs (blue line) above the $10 mark, and since breaking down over the past few months, CLF has lost almost 50% from its 2019 highs. Down seven weeks in a row has made this one a tough stock to own.

Let's see if CLF gets down to $6 and how it responds if it does. From here, investors either need to see CLF reclaim the 200-week or test $6. We'll have a better idea on CLF after that.

A 2019 favorite of mine, Invitae (NASDAQ: NVTA ) has not been trading all that well as of late. Shares gapped up in early August on drastically better-than-expected quarterly results.

But as the stock market chopped back and forth, NVTA wasn't able to demonstrate any relative strength. Worse, since that post-earnings gap up shares of Invitae have been under pressure, as downtrend resistance squeezes it lower.

With the 50-day moving average turning from support to resistance, NVTA has a true test potentially coming up: Will the $21 to $22 area support the stock? This level was support in March and April before giving way and acting as resistance in May and June.

At the end of June, NVTA reclaimed this level and it again served as support. Let's see if it does again. Below it and the 200-day moving average may be on the table.

2019-09-03 09:47:43,"  Applied Materials'   ( AMAT  ) stock has risen almost 3x over the past 4 years from $16.10 in August 2015 to $47.50 in August 2019. This rise was primarily driven by a sharp increase in revenue and net income margin, along with a drop in shares outstanding, which has pushed up earnings per share. We expect this growth to slow down going into late 2019, with a decrease in display and memory unit demand.

View our interactive dashboard analysis  Applied Materials: Why did the stock grow 3x in 4   years?  

 We break down the change in Applied Materials' stock into   4 factors: Stock Price = (Revenue x Margins / No. of Shares)   x P/E Multiple     

 A] Growth in Applied Materials' Revenue has been driven by   huge demand growth and increasing memory prices 

 B] Net Income Margin has grown from 14.3% in 2015 to 19.2% in   2018, and we expect it to further grow to 21.8% in 2019

DUBLIN, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Despairing at a country she believed was becoming more insular the more its Brexit debate raged, Briton Jess Worsdale decided this year that it was time to move to Ireland for good.

On Tuesday, she was among about 100 expatriates who stood in the rain outside Britain's embassy in Dublin to rally against Prime Minister Boris Johnson's planned suspension of parliament and potential ""no-deal"" exit from the European Union.

""My partner's Irish and we just wanted to come home and it feels more like home to me. It was a fairly easy decision.""

Worsdale and her partner were among the almost 20,000 people who, according to data from the Central Statistics Office last week, moved from the UK to EU member Ireland in the 12 months to April 2019, as 11,600 went in the other direction.

That trend marks a sharp change in the traditional movement between the neighbouring countries and is a near exact reversal of the figures in 2013, when Ireland was emerging from a financial crisis and Britain was still a committed member of the EU.

More than 7,000 of those who immigrated from the UK in the 12 months to April 2019 were British nationals, almost double the number making the move six years ago and included Will Fenwick, who held a handmade 'Listen to experts' sign outside the embassy gates.

""I lived in England my whole life until I moved here. It's very stressful watching this unfold,"" said the 27-year-old analyst from Newcastle, adding the Brexit-related fall in the value of sterling meant it had never been easier to move abroad, something lots of his friends were doing.

""I've seen my aunt lose her job. She got laid off in the Nissan factory in Sunderland. I've seen all the divisions this whole referendum has caused and I'm looking and thinking the economic consequences of a no-deal or even a deal could be catastrophic and I just can't face that for my country.""

As cries of 'Stop The Coup' rang out, the smattering of old and young Britons were cheered on by locals who beeped their car horns in support as they passed the short protest.

Like Worsdale and Fenwick, Tim, a 63-year-old protester who declined to give his last name, said that while he may not like it, he thought Britain should leave or its exit be put to a second vote. A ""no-deal"" Brexit, however, was not something anyone voted for.

""The heat in the argument, I don't recognise that,"" said the food industry worker, who left London for Dublin 22 years ago.

""Even amongst people I know, family, where sides have been taken. It's just very hard to square that with the Britain that I thought I came from. It seems to be broken, I'm not sure how this plays out, I'm at a loss. I think we all are.""",'Brexiles' protest in Dublin at prospect of UK leaving EU with no deal - Nasdaq.com,https://www.nasdaq.com/article/brexiles-protest-in-dublin-at-prospect-of-uk-leaving-eu-with-no-deal-20190903-01235

Your speakers today are   Norm Miller, the Company's CEO; Lee Wright, the Company's COO and   George Bchara, the Company's CFO. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Mr.   Miller. Please go ahead, sir.  Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman  Good morning and welcome to Conn's Second Quarter of Fiscal   Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. I'll begin the call with a   strategic overview. Then Lee will provide additional details on   the quarter before turning the call over to George, who will   complete our prepared remarks with additional comments on the   financial results. Our record second quarter earnings demonstrate our continued   success executing on our strategic priorities, our strong   operating performance across both our retail and credit segment   and the demand for our unique value proposition. We are pursuing   a compelling retail strategy that takes advantage of a large and   stable addressable market, and we have invested in people,   operations and systems to support our planned growth. As you may   recall, last quarter we launched our new e-commerce platform,   including the implementation of our upgraded website, which was a   significant milestone for our Company. Conn's has created an   end-to-end online solution, allowing our customer to transact   with us entirely online, using any of our financing options. I am also pleased to announce our planned expansion into the   Florida market, another significant milestone in the 129-year   history of our Company. Florida is a logical next step for our   geographic expansion as it is contiguous to our existing   footprint, is home to over 21 million people, and supports an   attractive rate environment for our in-house credit offering. To   support our future Florida locations, we recently executed a   lease agreement for an over 400,000 square foot distribution   center in Central Florida that will open in the next 12 months.   We expect the first Florida store to open in the second half of   next fiscal year. Ultimately, we believe the state of Florida   could support over 40 Conn's locations, which would represent a   significant expansion to our current store base. Our credit performance remains strong and is in line with the   strategy we outlined over three years ago. With confidence in our   underwriting and collections performance, our stable credit   segment provides us with additional opportunities to grow retail   sales and differentiate our business from other retailers.   Reflecting our optimism for the future and our desire to create   value for shareholders, I am pleased to announce that we have   repurchased $57.9 million of common stock through August 29,   which represents approximately 9.6% of our outstanding shares. As   you can see, positive momentum is accelerating across our   business and we believe fiscal year 2020 is shaping up to be a   year of strong earnings and operational growth. So with this overview, let me turn the call over to Lee, who   will provide more details on our second quarter operating   results.  Lee A. Wright    --   Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer  Thanks, Norm. The second quarter of fiscal year 2020 is the   second best quarter of total retail sales growth in 13 quarters,   despite the continued headwind of lapping the benefit of   Hurricane Harvey rebuilding efforts had on our results last   fiscal year. Although total same store sales decreased 2.3%,   reflecting the continued impact of Hurricane Harvey, I am pleased   to announce that total retail sales increased 3.3% for the second   quarter of fiscal year 2020 and same-store sales were positive in   non-Hurricane Harvey impacted markets, highlighting the power of   our growth opportunity. Year-to-date, we have opened 10 new showrooms in existing   states, including two opened in August. We plan to open four   additional locations in the third quarter. This will bring the   total number of showrooms opened in fiscal year 2020 to 14, all   within existing states, which reflects the highest number of new   stores that we will have opened in four years. New stores   continue to operate in line with our credit and retail   expectations. As a result, we plan to open a greater number of   showrooms next fiscal year, which includes several in Florida.   With only 133 stores in 14 states, we are excited by the   significant and long-term opportunity we have to expand our   footprint. Since coming to Conn's in July, Rodney Lastinger, our new   President of Retail has quickly contributed to our success,   helping to drive better retail execution both in our new stores   and within our existing store base. Rodney's experience at Target   Corporation, managing over $21 billion in sales, 85,000 team   members and 565 stores provides Conn's with a proven leader who   understands how to properly manage, scale and develop a large   retail operation. Same-store sales in non-Hurricane Harvey impacted markets   increased 0.4%, primarily due to higher sales within our home   appliance and furniture and mattress categories. In fact, total   same-store sales of our home appliance category were up 3.4%   during the second quarter and outpaced industry growth as we have   continued to enhance our better/best assortment and go-to-market   strategy. Our furniture and mattress category grew in non-Hurricane   Harvey markets as customers continued to embrace the increasing   number of new styles and looks now present in our showrooms.   Partially offsetting these second quarter strengths were lower   sales within our consumer electronics and home office categories,   which were impacted by challenging market dynamics for TVs,   computers and gaming consoles. Overall, we continue to   strategically manage our merchandising assortment and we believe   we are well-positioned to continue growing same-store sales as a   result of our better/best product focused, attractive financing   programs and compelling retail shopping experience. Second quarter same-store sales within our Hurricane Harvey   market, which includes our largest market of Houston, continued   to demonstrate the significant contribution rebuilding efforts   had on our retail sales last fiscal year. For the quarter,   same-store sales in hurricane impacted markets were down 9.3%,   which is the smallest decline over the last four quarters and is   a 550 basis point improvement compared to the first quarter. As a   reminder, Hurricane Harvey affected several of our Texas markets,   including our home market of Houston in August 2017. It has taken   two full years for us to lap Hurricane Harvey's impact, and we   believe this current quarter will be the last period meaningfully   affected by Hurricane Harvey. Turning to e-commerce sales, which are included in same-store   sales, the second quarter reflects the transformational increase   in web visits, online applications and e-commerce sales. For the   second quarter of fiscal year 2020, e-commerce sales were $3.2   million, which is approximately 20% higher than total e-commerce   sales for all of last fiscal year. Application volume increased   sequentially as result of improvements in online platform after   the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 transition to our new   website. In addition, we are starting to see improving trends and   application volume from Hurricane Harvey market. In fact, total   application volume for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 was   the highest second quarter amount in three years even with the   continued pressure our Harvey impacted markets have had on   application and sales volume. We are well positioned to expand e-commerce sales in the   coming quarters as our digital marketing efforts grow. Our   existing logistics infrastructure, warehouse locations and last   mile delivery capabilities are fully scalable as we already offer   next day delivery across our 14-state store network. We are   excited by the positive trends we are seeing in online traffic,   applications and sales and we believe that our ability to   transact with our customers through our e-commerce platform is an   important capability that supports our continued growth. With over 90% of our retail sales completed using one of   Conn's three credit offerings, we worked closely with both   Progressive Leasing and Synchrony Financial to optimize our third   party financing programs. Our unique and diverse credit offerings   provide significant value for our customers and partners, while   differentiating Conn's from other retailers. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, we understand   that our lease to own financing partner, Progressive Leasing,   modestly tightened underwriting standards for lease transactions   across many of their product category verticals, which included   all of our eligible product verticals. Progressive and Conn's   remain committed partners and we continue to believe 10% of   retail sales through Progressive's offering is achievable. In addition, we continue to work with Synchrony, our third   party partner for prime credit customers to enhance our   relationship and expand our programs to prime customers. As a   result of these efforts, sales financed through Synchrony   increased to 17.7% of total retail sales for the second quarter   of fiscal year 2020, compared to 16.4% for the same period last   fiscal year and up 200 basis points compared to Synchrony sales   for fiscal year 2017. Quickly looking at the profitability of our retail segment,   retail gross margin remained strong. We continue to benefit from   our better/best merchandising strategy. Retail gross margin was   40.5% for the second quarter, representing the fifth consecutive   quarter at or above our target rate of 40%. The 90 basis point   year-over-year decline in retail gross margin was due primarily   to the one-time benefit of increases in appliance retail pricing   related to tariff adjustments and the associated forward buys of   inventory during the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, coupled   with increased logistics costs to help support future growth   specifically related to our new Houston distribution center. I am   pleased with the continued strength of retail profitability and   the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 is in line with our   strategy to produce annual retail gross margin above 40%. Positive momentum is under way in our retail business, and we   expect the second half of fiscal year 2020 to benefit from   improving retail execution in the longer tenure of our   merchandising, marketing and operations teams. We also expect the   second half of the fiscal year to be positively impacted by new   stores, sales from our e-commerce platform and lapping the sales   impact from Hurricane Harvey. With this overview of our retail segment, let's look at the   continued positive trends under way in our credit segment. Credit   results remain strong and are in line with expected seasonal   trends. Our credit spread for the second quarter was 890 basis   points, representing the highest second quarter credit spread in   six years as a result of a net yield of 21.9% and a net   charge-off rate of 13%. On a trailing 12-month basis, our credit   spread was 920 basis points at July 31, 2019 compared to 660   basis points at July 31, 2018. As a reminder, seasonality impacts   credit performance as our core customer receives the benefits of   personal income tax refunds during the first quarter. Overall portfolio performance has benefited from stable   underwriting, the enhancements we have made in our collection of   recovery efforts and a healthy economic environment for our core   customer. As a result, the 60-plus day delinquency rate remained   stable at 8.7%, while our charge-off rate net of recoveries was   13% compared to 13.8% for the same period last fiscal year. In   addition, we continue to control new store credit performance and   first payment default rate at our new stores remain better than   the Company average. Improving our recovery process remains a strategic focus as   higher cash recoveries result in lower net charge-offs and   reduced loss rates on our allowance for bad debt. For the second   quarter of fiscal year 2020, we collected $6.1 million of   recoveries, a 26% increase from the same period last fiscal year.   Year-to-date, we have collected $12.5 million and we remain on   track to collect over $20 million in recoveries this fiscal   year. As our trailing 12-month credit spread demonstrates the   majority of our portfolio, including recent originations, is in   line with our 1,000 basis point annual credit spread target. As a   result, our sophisticated underwriting team continues to analyze   and segment our portfolio to identify and test incremental sales   opportunities. We remain focused on maintaining a stable credit business and   I am confident in our ability to manage risk going forward, even   as growth accelerates. Positive same-store sales and   non-Hurricane Harvey impacted markets, higher total application   volume and growth in e-commerce sales demonstrates the positive   momentum under way in our business. As a result, we believe we   are well-positioned to achieve total annual retail sales growth   of 8% to 10% in the coming quarters. At this level of growth, we   can manage the credit segment with our 1,000 basis point spread   target while achieving annual retail gross margin of at least 40%   in leveraging SG&A expenses. This is the foundation of a very   powerful and sustainable business model and I am extremely   excited by the opportunities we have in fiscal year 2020 and   beyond. With this, let me turn the call over to George.  George L. Bchara    --   Chief Financial Officer  Thanks Lee. I'm pleased to report results in line with or   better than our guidance across every financial measure. On a   consolidated basis, revenues increased 4.3% to $401.1 million for   the second quarter of this fiscal year from $384.6 million for   the same period last fiscal year. This helped drive an increase   in GAAP net income of 17.4% to $20 million or $0.62 per diluted   share for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 from $17 million   or 53% per diluted share for the prior fiscal year quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusting for certain charges and credit   and loss from extinguishment of debt, earnings per diluted share   were $0.62 for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 compared to   $0.57 for the same period last fiscal year. Adjusted EBITDA was   $54 million or 13.5% of total revenue for the second quarter of   fiscal year 2020 compared to $50.4 million or 13.1% of total   revenue for the same period last fiscal year. Reconciliations of   GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are available on our second   quarter earnings press release that was issued this morning. Looking at our retail segment in more detail, total revenues   for the second quarter increased 3.3% to $306.3 million for the   same quarter last fiscal year. Regarding the ongoing trade   negotiations and tariff, our merchandising team in partnership   with our top vendors, has made substantial progress since last   year in diversifying our production outside China and other   affected countries. For goods covered by tariffs, the higher   costs have generally been split between the parties, thereby   limiting the retail increases needed to offset the tariff.   Additional tariffs impacting consumer goods, including   electronics, computers and accessories were announced in early   August. While postponed, we believe this latest round of tariffs,   could have an impact on prices and demand for these products if   they were to go into effect. Retail SG&A expense was $88.1   million, an increase of approximately $5.1 million from the same   quarter in the prior fiscal year, while retail SG&A expense   as a percentage of revenue deleveraged 80 basis points to 28.8%,   primarily due to increased costs for new stores. I am pleased to announce that our new state-of-the-art Houston   distribution center opened in August. This LEED-certified   facility will increase the capacity and efficiency of our retail   operations within our largest market. Costs will be higher   temporarily as we wind down operations from our legacy Houston   distribution center, which we expect to be completed by the   fourth quarter. In addition, for fiscal year 2020, we plan to   open 14 stores compared to seven stores last fiscal year and only   three stores two years ago. We typically start incurring costs   associated with new stores approximately six months ahead of   opening and there will be additional expenses incurred throughout   the fiscal year as we prepare to open these locations. I also want to mention, during the second quarter, we   successfully implemented our new ERP system and we are   progressing toward a successful conversion of our new loan   management system, which we expect to be completed during the   third quarter. As you can see, we are making a number of   near-term investments to support our meaningful and long-term   growth plan. This includes higher expenses associated with new   distribution centers as well as investments in SG&A to   support accelerating new store growth and our planned Florida   expansion. While these higher costs will temporarily impact our   overall level of profitability, they are necessary investments as   we continue to expand our retail footprint and grow sales. Turning to the credit segment, finance charges and other   revenues were a second quarter record of $94.8 million, up 7.5%   from the same period last fiscal year. The increase versus the   second quarter of fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to a 60   basis point increase in the portfolio yield to 21.9% as well as   higher retrospective insurance income compared to the prior   fiscal year period. Second quarter net annualized charge-offs as a percent of the   average outstanding balance were 13%, an 80 basis point   improvement over the prior fiscal year period. Provision for bad   debts in the credit segment was $49.8 million for the second   quarter of fiscal year 2020, a decrease of approximately $0.8   million from the same period last fiscal year, primarily due to   strong portfolio performance. The allowance for bad debts and   uncollected interest as a percent of the total portfolio was   13.3% at July 31, 2019, which was down approximately 20 basis   points from the prior fiscal year period. SG&A expense in the   credit segment for the second quarter increased 4.4% versus the   same quarter last fiscal year and on an annualized basis as a   percentage of the average customer portfolio balance was 10.2%   compared to 10.1%. The increase in credit SG&A primarily   reflects continued investments we are making in our recovery   effort and an increase in operational expenses to support our   growth. Interest expense for the second quarter was $14.4   million, which declined 7.5% from the same period last fiscal   year, as a result of reductions in our weighted average cost of   funds. For the second quarter, annualized interest expense as a   percentage of the average portfolio balance was 3.7% compared to   4.2% for the same period last fiscal year. Average net debt as a   percentage of the average portfolio balance was approximately 62%   -- 61% for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 compared to 62%   for the prior fiscal year period. ABS notes currently outstanding   include all classes of our 2019 A and 2018 A notes and the B and   C classes of our 2017 B note. We currently expect to complete one   additional ABS transaction during the current fiscal year. I am very pleased with the improvements we continue to make in   our capital position. We expect to fund our anticipated growth   through internally generated funds and from our existing capital   sources. As Norm mentioned, through August 29, we have   repurchased a total of 3.1 million shares at an average price of   $18.79 per share, which is approximately 6% below our book value   as of April 30th, 2019. The total amount repurchased through August 29 under our $75   million share repurchase plan was $57.9 million or 9.6% of our   outstanding shares. During the second quarter, we repurchased   $34.3 million of our common stock and funded the growth of our   customer receivables portfolio while our net debt to adjusted   EBITDA ratio declined. Before opening the call up for questions,   I want to note that we continue to expect our annual effective   tax rate to be between 25% and 27% for the current fiscal   year. With this overview, Norm, Lee and I are happy to take your   questions. Operator, Please open the call up to question. Questions and Answers:  Operator  Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a   question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first   question comes from the line of John Baugh with Stifel. Please   proceed with your question.  John A. Baugh    --   Stifel, Nicolus & Company, Inc. -- Analyst  Thank you. Good morning and congratulations on a good   quarter.  Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman  Thank you, John.  Lee A. Wright    --   Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer  Good Morning.  George L. Bchara    --   Chief Financial Officer  Good Morning.  John A. Baugh    --   Stifel, Nicolus & Company, Inc. -- Analyst  What if we could start with Florida and maybe talk a little   bit about how you expect the expenses to ramp there and   importantly, the interest rate cap or regulatory environment   within that state?  Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman  Sure, John. I'll start off with the reason we went to Florida   and then I'll hand it to Lee and George to talk about the   SG&A side. Florida obviously is contiguous to our existing   market. So, makes a lot of sense for us. Very attractive from a   rate standpoint. We were able to charge -- it is -- it will be a   state licensed product and we'll be able to charge the 29.99% APR   and so -- and from a demographic standpoint, as you heard in our   comments, there's 21 million people in Florida, a lot of   similarities to the state of Texas from a demographic standpoint.   And we're very bullish about what it bodes from a future sales   standpoint.  Lee A. Wright    --   Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer  Yeah, and from an operational standpoint, John, expenses -- as   we mentioned, we've signed a lease with the distribution center   in Central Florida. It gives us that core location for our   logistics build out. We'll start incurring expenses in the fourth   quarter as we go. We'll start opening showrooms in the second   half of next year and ramp that up. Again, obviously, as you   know, when we go into new market, we will have some marketing   expenses as we enter there and make sure we get our brand name   out, but as we talked about and Norm said in the call, very   excited about Florida's long term potential. So from that   standpoint, it's certainly worth the investment, a long-term play   for us, the 40-plus stores we are going to open at the state.  John A. Baugh    --   Stifel, Nicolus & Company, Inc. -- Analyst  Great. And then, maybe we could talk again about same-store   sales, and I'm particularly interested in non-Harvey and you've   got, I assume, some building benefit from new stores you opened   over a year ago, offset by some cannibalization because all the   stores have been in existing markets. Could you talk about the   plus and the minus there and maybe how that's influencing numbers   now and how that might change going forward with the Florida   plan?  Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman  Yeah, John. So currently, because we didn't open that many   stores, last year seven, there's not many in the comp base. It'll   be the fourth quarter and into the first quarter of next year   when we will start to see that benefit. As you well know,   historically when the Company opened new stores, we would open   them at $8 million to $10 million in revenue in the first year.   We're now averaging between $6 million and $7 million in revenue   because of the tightened underwriting. And those stores, by the   way, are still profitable and pay back in the first year even at   those reduced initial revenue levels, but they will give us   tailwinds in future years. We believe ultimately the stores will   still mature to that $10 million on average from a revenue   standpoint and we should see tailwinds from a three to five-year   timeframe from a comp standpoint that should bode very well for   us in the next year, certainly the back half of next year as   we're lapping the significant number of stores we've added this   year.  Lee A. Wright    --   Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer  And John, just a follow up. As you mentioned, ultimately there   will be cannibalization in some of our existing markets as we   open the showrooms in existing states. But obviously, we strongly   believe we've seen it. We grow our overall total sales by market   significantly so it would make sense. As they become a bigger   piece, the cannibalization, we'll look at break that for you as   we used to do in the past.  John A. Baugh    --   Stifel, Nicolus & Company, Inc. -- Analyst  Okay. But is there a little bit of a drag in, say, the Q2   numbers and the Q3 expectations from cannibalization   currently?  Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman  Very little, John.  Lee A. Wright    --   Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer  Yeah.  John A. Baugh    --   Stifel, Nicolus & Company, Inc. -- Analyst  Okay. Alright, and my last question, well, I have many more,   but I'll get back in queue, huge increase in applications   processed in Q2, significant turn there. Could you talk about --   what's online, what's maybe a byproduct of -- I am comparing more   to the first quarter where I know you had some challenges with   the new online process. What -- kind of walk through the pieces   of that applications and are you seeing an increase in   applications offline, if you will, in existing non-Harvey   markets? Any way you can slice that? Thank you.  Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman  Thanks, John. Yeah, we always really communicated in the past   is our online applications are greater and are growing at a   faster pace than our retail applications. As you know, that's why   we changed our platform. We went through a bit of a bumpy road in   the first quarter as we transition to the new e-commerce   platform, but as we shared at the end of the first quarter, we're   seeing the impact of that new platform, the effectiveness of the   platform and we believe that's reflected not only in e-commerce   sales that Lee touched for the quarter where we were 20% higher   in e-commerce sales for the quarter for what we did the entire   prior year, we believe we're still in the very early innings of   what we can deliver from an omni-channel standpoint as a   retailer. So, very bullish about what the future bodes from both   an application which ultimately translates to sales   standpoint.  John A. Baugh    --   Stifel, Nicolus & Company, Inc. -- Analyst  Thank you, good luck.  Lee A. Wright    --   Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer  Thanks, John.  Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman  Thanks, John.  Operator  Our next question comes from the line of Brad Thomas with   KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.  Bradley B. Thomas    --   Key Banc Capital Markets, Inc. -- Analyst  Yeah. Thank you. Good morning, Norm, Lee and George, and nice   results here.  Lee A. Wright    --   Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer  Thanks, Brad.  Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman  Thanks, Brad.  Bradley B. Thomas    --   Key Banc Capital Markets, Inc. -- Analyst  I guess, guys, I wanted to zoom in first, maybe on the retail   gross margin and I was hoping you could talk a little bit about   some of the puts and takes as we think about modeling it over the   next couple of quarters, particularly as you think about tariffs   starting to roll in?  Lee A. Wright    --   Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer  Yeah, Brad. It's Lee, good morning. So from a retail gross   margin, I think what we tried to stress on the calls, what I   continue to reiterate is that, look, we want to make sure that   we're in that 40-plus retail gross margin range and feel very   comfortable that we can keep it there. Obviously, our it's our   52nd [Phonetic] quarter at or above that rate that we we're   excited about, obviously down year-over-year, but we did talk   about from the standpoint that we did have some of those 4s and   5s [Phonetic] some of the tariffs that came in and we've bought   pre those tariff implementations. So we got a one-time benefit   from that. So, I would just point you back that we feel very   comfortable with that 40% retail gross margin piece and that's   sort of what we guided toward the next quarter in that   standpoint. So from that, yes, we look at it. That's where we   really would continue to point you toward.  Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman  And we have some downward pressure because of the logistic   side of the house with the new Houston DC, the opening of the   floor to DC. Both of those will -- we will incur some cost here   as we get those, the old legacy Houston DC closed and the new   floor to DC open, but even with those give and takes, we still   expect to be at or above that 40% margin level.  Bradley B. Thomas    --   Key Banc Capital Markets, Inc. -- Analyst  Okay. That's great. And as we think about the new DC and the   store openings, you'll be ramping in for next year, I guess, as   we calibrate our models, you guys are real helpful, kind of one   quarter out, giving us some line items, but as we start to think   about the fourth quarter and some of these costs coming in, any   more quantification or color you could share with us on how to   think about SG&A and some of the ramp in expenses?  George L. Bchara    --   Chief Financial Officer  Yeah. Hey, Brad. This is George. I would tell you that as we   continue to open up increasing new stores year-over-year. So this   year we're planning to open 14 stores compared to seven last year   and we talked about opening even more stores next year. We will   continue to see some deleveraging from an SG&A   standpoint.  Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman  But as we get to that consistent run rate basis, you'll then   start to see the leveraging from an SG&A.  Lee A. Wright    --   Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer  Yeah.  Bradley B. Thomas    --   Key Banc Capital Markets, Inc. -- Analyst  Okay, OK. And if I could squeeze one more in here, just on the   comments around the lease to own, that had been growing pretty   nicely the last few quarters and took kind of a step back   sequentially. I mean if you had been in line in 2Q with where it   was as a percentage of sales in 1Q, looks like comp sort of ended   up [Phonetic] about two points better. I guess, could you help us   think about -- maybe how much of a headwind that was for you here   in 2Q, is -- would 2% be a reasonable estimate?  Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman  I think that's reasonable, Brad, and -- but what I would say   is and as we shared in the prepared comments, it was really   driven predominantly by our partner and some things they did, not   specific to Conn's, but overall from an underwriting standpoint.   Having said that, hasn't shaken what our belief is long term on   the lease-to-own opportunities that we have. Remember, in the   past 12 months, we had 1.2 million applications submitted from a   Conn standpoint, both in-house and online and approximately   700,000 were approved, which means about 500,000 are declined. So   that speaks to the magnitude of the opportunities that exist for   us to capture and get to that, why we remain very bullish on our   ability ultimately to get to that 10% balance of sale, not at the   expense of other elements of financing, but by growing the   overall size of the pie.  Bradley B. Thomas    --   Key Banc Capital Markets, Inc. -- Analyst  Great. Thank you very much.  Operator  Our next question comes from the line of Rick Nelson with   Stephens. Please proceed with your question.  Rick Nelson    --   Stephens Inc. -- Analyst  Thanks. Good morning, guys.  Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman  Good morning.  George L. Bchara    --   Chief Financial Officer  Good morning.  Lee A. Wright    --   Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer  Morning, Rick.  Rick Nelson    --   Stephens Inc. -- Analyst  Looking at spread between Harvey and non-Harvey markets, same   store --- [Indecipherable] 11% you are guiding to a 6% spread at   the midpoint for 3Q. Do you think that spread goes away in the   fourth quarter? What is the timing you think there?  Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman  Yeah, we think it will be negligible in the fourth quarter,   Rick. We don't anticipate breaking out Harvey and non-Harvey in   the fourth quarter.  Rick Nelson    --   Stephens Inc. -- Analyst  Okay, gotcha. And the accelerating new store growth that you   referenced, is that number of units or is that percentage growth   rate (Speech Overlap].  George L. Bchara    --   Chief Financial Officer  The number of units.  Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman  Number of units.  George L. Bchara    --   Chief Financial Officer  Number of unit.  Rick Nelson    --   Stephens Inc. -- Analyst  Gotcha. And e-com, can you discuss the economics there? The   lost rate, it's interesting you referred to the store's showroom?   Do you see over the long haul, online sales accounting for a   substantial proportion of your volume?  Lee A. Wright    --   Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer  Well, Rick, so first of all, thanks for the call out on   showrooms. We're excited about the look and feel of our new   showrooms and existing showrooms, and I know you'll be down here   to see what our new showroom. So -- but with regard to the   e-commerce, obviously very pleased to see that we were --   actually our e-commerce revenues 20% [Phonetic] all of last year.   Certainly believe it should be a material percentage of sales,   but we really do believe that's going to be incremental sales on   top of there'll be some cannibalization that mostly new customers   able to come on. And as you referenced, we certainly are very   careful from an underwriting perspective is why we took so long   to actually offer a true omni-channel online e-commerce   experience. Look, with John Davis and team, we certainly have the   sophistication to do the proper underwriting and not take any   excessive losses. So we are excited about that going forward.  Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman  And just as you've seen, Rick, on our new stores, our FTDs   continue to run. They're lower than the portfolio average. From   an underwriting standpoint online, we're well aware of the risk   associated with the online consumer versus the retail in-person   consumer. So we're taking appropriate steps from an underwriting   standpoint to ensure that as we've stated, any business, that we   underwrite, always with the risk mindset of maintaining that   1,000 basis points of credit spreads.  Rick Nelson    --   Stephens Inc. -- Analyst  Okay, that's good. And I thought, the Florida expansion also   interesting. Any thoughts on how many stores you could open   across the country?  Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman  I know that in the past there's been numbers thrown out there,   prefer at this point not to. It is materially by several factors   bigger than what our store base is now. Out of the 50 states,   when you look at attractiveness from a from a high APR being in   the high 20s APR, there's 35 plus states that give us that   opportunity right off the bat. So when you're only in 14 of them   and Florida is obviously one, California is one and a number of   other high population states give us that opportunity in addition   to where we're at now. So, we believe we can grow at that 8% to   10% top line revenue growth for many, many years from a growth   standpoint, because our customer -- our core customer demographic   is in every city, every town, every state of the United States.   They represent about 20% of the US population. So, the potential   future growth is enormous for the Company.  Rick Nelson    --   Stephens Inc. -- Analyst  By sustaining [Indecipherable] that proportion of the   population actually would grow in a downturn?  Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman  That has been historically --a number of the members of the   senior leadership team, including myself and Lee and JD, have   operated in sub prime for a number of years. We've been in it in   various economic cycles and downturns. And, although there is   some impact when there is a recession, there is also a   significant opportunity that presents itself as well as more   customers enter into our core focus or demographic. So -- we   don't -- from a recessionary standpoint or a cycle standpoint, we   are aware of that, but it gives us as much opportunities as it   does the challenges that would be presented in a down cycle.  Rick Nelson    --   Stephens Inc. -- Analyst  Got it. Thanks for the color and good luck.  Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman  Thanks, Rick.  Lee A. Wright    --   Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer  Thanks, Rick.  Operator  Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Joseph with   Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.  Kyle Joseph    --   Jefferies, LLC -- Analyst  Hey, good morning, guys. Most of my questions have been asked.   Just to follow up on credit and I can wait for the queue for   this, but just to get a sense of the charge of decline   year-over-year, is that primarily from the better recoveries or   are you also basically looking for some color on frequency versus   severity in terms of losses?  Lee A. Wright    --   Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer  Yeah, certainly recoveries had an impact. We've been excited   about the ramp up and continued pace of our recovery effort. And   so that's the material piece, Kyle.  Kyle Joseph    --   Jefferies, LLC -- Analyst  And then from from a frequency perspective, I know you guys   talked about first payment default management at new stores, but   can you give us any sort of sense of what trends you're seeing   there?  Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman  Continue to be very pleased with 60-day plus delinquencies and   for FTDs, which as you know, Kyle, are the two leading indicators   of what the quality and the strength of the portfolio is. So this   year and going forward, we're not going to see the significant   increases we saw in past years because we're close to that 1,000   basis point spread and as we hit that and we achieve that, we'll   take associated incremental risk to maintain the 1,000 basis   points, but also give us retail opportunity. So, the target here   going forward, you shouldn't see significant fluctuations there   because we're within that range. So, we're targeting spread   wise.  Kyle Joseph    --   Jefferies, LLC -- Analyst  That's it for me. Thanks very much for answering my   question.  Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman  Thanks a lot, John.  Operator  And our next question comes from the line of Bill Ryan with   Compass Point. Please proceed with your question.  William Ryan    --   Compass Point Research & Trading -- Analyst  Thanks and good morning. A couple of questions. First, there's   obviously been a reduction in market interest rates and you   talked about doing one more securitization this year and you're   obviously going to be rolling some of the prior deals. Do you see   an opportunity with a reduction in market rates that the funding   costs might actually come down a little bit further as we   progress over the next few quarters? And secondly, going back to   the disparity between the implementation of the tariffs and the   pricing changes that you implemented, because obviously you had   an outsized retail gross margin in Q4 last year. I want to kind   of get some anticipate -- what you anticipate of what Q4, the   retail gross margin might look like. Thanks.  George L. Bchara    --   Chief Financial Officer  Hey, Bill, this is George. With respect to your first question   around interest rates, our ABL is tied to LIBOR rates. So   certainly as market rates come down, it is possible that we would   see reductions in our interest rate as a result. And then, with   respect to the second question on tariffs, I mean, we continue to   guide and feel comfortable with our 40 basis -- 40% retail gross   margin throughout the back half of the year.  Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman  Now, you are right, Bill, that the fourth quarter was   elevated. So, it's typically our highest quarter from from a   margin standpoint. One of our higher quarters. So -- but we don't   expect to probably be at that level. We haven't guided for   quarter four yet, but it won't be at that elevated level because   of some of the tariff and some other things -- one-time things   that occurred in that fourth quarter, but still above that 40%   for certain.  William Ryan    --   Compass Point Research & Trading -- Analyst  Okay. One last thing. In terms of lease-to-own, obviously,   some competitors introduced a lease-to-own product earlier this   year. Just want to kind of get an idea, are you seeing any   incremental competition on the lease-to-own product as well in   your stores?  Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman  On a very limited basis, Bill. I mean, our expectation is   ultimately probably every retailer will have some lease-to-own   product, every bricks and mortar retailer. Remember, our customer   and the ones we're attracting now, very different than what the   prime customer is targeting and attracting which is why out of   the 1.2 million applications we get, 500,000 we decline as I   mentioned earlier. So the pool we have from an opportunity to   grow our lease-to-own and to capture that 10% is within our walls   right now, even if we lose some small piece of that. And   remember, our financing is 2.5 times to 3 times better or less   expensive for a customer if they can qualify for our Conn's   financing versus having to move to a lease-to-own option.  William Ryan    --   Compass Point Research & Trading -- Analyst  All right. Thank you.  Lee A. Wright    --   Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer  Thanks, Bill.  Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman  Thanks. Bill.  Operator  Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the   question-and-answer session, and I would like to turn the call   back to Norm Miller for closing remarks.

 Conn's Inc    (NASDAQ: CONN)        Q2 2020 Earnings Call       Sep 3, 2019 ,   11:00 a.m. ET 

 Operator 

Good morning and thank you for holding. Welcome to the Conn's   Inc. Conference Call to discuss earnings for the fiscal quarter   ended July 31, 2019. My name is Dana and I will be your operator   today. During the presentation, all participants will be in a   listen-only mode. After the speaker's remarks, you will be   invited to participate in the question-and-answer session. As a   reminder, this conference call is being recorded.

During today's call, management will discuss, among other   financial performance measures, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net   income and adjusted earnings per diluted share. Please refer to   the Company's earnings release that was issued today for a   reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable   GAAP measures. I must remind you that some of the statements made   in this call are forward-looking statements within the meaning of   the federal securities laws.

I would now like to turn the conference call over to Mr.   Miller. Please go ahead, sir.

 Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman 

Good morning and welcome to Conn's Second Quarter of Fiscal   Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. I'll begin the call with a   strategic overview. Then Lee will provide additional details on   the quarter before turning the call over to George, who will   complete our prepared remarks with additional comments on the   financial results.

Our record second quarter earnings demonstrate our continued   success executing on our strategic priorities, our strong   operating performance across both our retail and credit segment   and the demand for our unique value proposition. We are pursuing   a compelling retail strategy that takes advantage of a large and   stable addressable market, and we have invested in people,   operations and systems to support our planned growth. As you may   recall, last quarter we launched our new e-commerce platform,   including the implementation of our upgraded website, which was a   significant milestone for our Company. Conn's has created an   end-to-end online solution, allowing our customer to transact   with us entirely online, using any of our financing options.

I am also pleased to announce our planned expansion into the   Florida market, another significant milestone in the 129-year   history of our Company. Florida is a logical next step for our   geographic expansion as it is contiguous to our existing   footprint, is home to over 21 million people, and supports an   attractive rate environment for our in-house credit offering. To   support our future Florida locations, we recently executed a   lease agreement for an over 400,000 square foot distribution   center in Central Florida that will open in the next 12 months.   We expect the first Florida store to open in the second half of   next fiscal year. Ultimately, we believe the state of Florida   could support over 40 Conn's locations, which would represent a   significant expansion to our current store base.

Our credit performance remains strong and is in line with the   strategy we outlined over three years ago. With confidence in our   underwriting and collections performance, our stable credit   segment provides us with additional opportunities to grow retail   sales and differentiate our business from other retailers.   Reflecting our optimism for the future and our desire to create   value for shareholders, I am pleased to announce that we have   repurchased $57.9 million of common stock through August 29,   which represents approximately 9.6% of our outstanding shares. As   you can see, positive momentum is accelerating across our   business and we believe fiscal year 2020 is shaping up to be a   year of strong earnings and operational growth.

So with this overview, let me turn the call over to Lee, who   will provide more details on our second quarter operating   results.

 Lee A. Wright    --   Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer 

Thanks, Norm. The second quarter of fiscal year 2020 is the   second best quarter of total retail sales growth in 13 quarters,   despite the continued headwind of lapping the benefit of   Hurricane Harvey rebuilding efforts had on our results last   fiscal year. Although total same store sales decreased 2.3%,   reflecting the continued impact of Hurricane Harvey, I am pleased   to announce that total retail sales increased 3.3% for the second   quarter of fiscal year 2020 and same-store sales were positive in   non-Hurricane Harvey impacted markets, highlighting the power of   our growth opportunity.

Year-to-date, we have opened 10 new showrooms in existing   states, including two opened in August. We plan to open four   additional locations in the third quarter. This will bring the   total number of showrooms opened in fiscal year 2020 to 14, all   within existing states, which reflects the highest number of new   stores that we will have opened in four years. New stores   continue to operate in line with our credit and retail   expectations. As a result, we plan to open a greater number of   showrooms next fiscal year, which includes several in Florida.   With only 133 stores in 14 states, we are excited by the   significant and long-term opportunity we have to expand our   footprint.

Since coming to Conn's in July, Rodney Lastinger, our new   President of Retail has quickly contributed to our success,   helping to drive better retail execution both in our new stores   and within our existing store base. Rodney's experience at Target   Corporation, managing over $21 billion in sales, 85,000 team   members and 565 stores provides Conn's with a proven leader who   understands how to properly manage, scale and develop a large   retail operation.

Same-store sales in non-Hurricane Harvey impacted markets   increased 0.4%, primarily due to higher sales within our home   appliance and furniture and mattress categories. In fact, total   same-store sales of our home appliance category were up 3.4%   during the second quarter and outpaced industry growth as we have   continued to enhance our better/best assortment and go-to-market   strategy.

Our furniture and mattress category grew in non-Hurricane   Harvey markets as customers continued to embrace the increasing   number of new styles and looks now present in our showrooms.   Partially offsetting these second quarter strengths were lower   sales within our consumer electronics and home office categories,   which were impacted by challenging market dynamics for TVs,   computers and gaming consoles. Overall, we continue to   strategically manage our merchandising assortment and we believe   we are well-positioned to continue growing same-store sales as a   result of our better/best product focused, attractive financing   programs and compelling retail shopping experience.

Second quarter same-store sales within our Hurricane Harvey   market, which includes our largest market of Houston, continued   to demonstrate the significant contribution rebuilding efforts   had on our retail sales last fiscal year. For the quarter,   same-store sales in hurricane impacted markets were down 9.3%,   which is the smallest decline over the last four quarters and is   a 550 basis point improvement compared to the first quarter. As a   reminder, Hurricane Harvey affected several of our Texas markets,   including our home market of Houston in August 2017. It has taken   two full years for us to lap Hurricane Harvey's impact, and we   believe this current quarter will be the last period meaningfully   affected by Hurricane Harvey.

Turning to e-commerce sales, which are included in same-store   sales, the second quarter reflects the transformational increase   in web visits, online applications and e-commerce sales. For the   second quarter of fiscal year 2020, e-commerce sales were $3.2   million, which is approximately 20% higher than total e-commerce   sales for all of last fiscal year. Application volume increased   sequentially as result of improvements in online platform after   the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 transition to our new   website. In addition, we are starting to see improving trends and   application volume from Hurricane Harvey market. In fact, total   application volume for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 was   the highest second quarter amount in three years even with the   continued pressure our Harvey impacted markets have had on   application and sales volume.

We are well positioned to expand e-commerce sales in the   coming quarters as our digital marketing efforts grow. Our   existing logistics infrastructure, warehouse locations and last   mile delivery capabilities are fully scalable as we already offer   next day delivery across our 14-state store network. We are   excited by the positive trends we are seeing in online traffic,   applications and sales and we believe that our ability to   transact with our customers through our e-commerce platform is an   important capability that supports our continued growth.

With over 90% of our retail sales completed using one of   Conn's three credit offerings, we worked closely with both   Progressive Leasing and Synchrony Financial to optimize our third   party financing programs. Our unique and diverse credit offerings   provide significant value for our customers and partners, while   differentiating Conn's from other retailers.

During the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, we understand   that our lease to own financing partner, Progressive Leasing,   modestly tightened underwriting standards for lease transactions   across many of their product category verticals, which included   all of our eligible product verticals. Progressive and Conn's   remain committed partners and we continue to believe 10% of   retail sales through Progressive's offering is achievable.

In addition, we continue to work with Synchrony, our third   party partner for prime credit customers to enhance our   relationship and expand our programs to prime customers. As a   result of these efforts, sales financed through Synchrony   increased to 17.7% of total retail sales for the second quarter   of fiscal year 2020, compared to 16.4% for the same period last   fiscal year and up 200 basis points compared to Synchrony sales   for fiscal year 2017.

Quickly looking at the profitability of our retail segment,   retail gross margin remained strong. We continue to benefit from   our better/best merchandising strategy. Retail gross margin was   40.5% for the second quarter, representing the fifth consecutive   quarter at or above our target rate of 40%. The 90 basis point   year-over-year decline in retail gross margin was due primarily   to the one-time benefit of increases in appliance retail pricing   related to tariff adjustments and the associated forward buys of   inventory during the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, coupled   with increased logistics costs to help support future growth   specifically related to our new Houston distribution center. I am   pleased with the continued strength of retail profitability and   the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 is in line with our   strategy to produce annual retail gross margin above 40%.

Positive momentum is under way in our retail business, and we   expect the second half of fiscal year 2020 to benefit from   improving retail execution in the longer tenure of our   merchandising, marketing and operations teams. We also expect the   second half of the fiscal year to be positively impacted by new   stores, sales from our e-commerce platform and lapping the sales   impact from Hurricane Harvey.

With this overview of our retail segment, let's look at the   continued positive trends under way in our credit segment. Credit   results remain strong and are in line with expected seasonal   trends. Our credit spread for the second quarter was 890 basis   points, representing the highest second quarter credit spread in   six years as a result of a net yield of 21.9% and a net   charge-off rate of 13%. On a trailing 12-month basis, our credit   spread was 920 basis points at July 31, 2019 compared to 660   basis points at July 31, 2018. As a reminder, seasonality impacts   credit performance as our core customer receives the benefits of   personal income tax refunds during the first quarter.

Overall portfolio performance has benefited from stable   underwriting, the enhancements we have made in our collection of   recovery efforts and a healthy economic environment for our core   customer. As a result, the 60-plus day delinquency rate remained   stable at 8.7%, while our charge-off rate net of recoveries was   13% compared to 13.8% for the same period last fiscal year. In   addition, we continue to control new store credit performance and   first payment default rate at our new stores remain better than   the Company average.

Improving our recovery process remains a strategic focus as   higher cash recoveries result in lower net charge-offs and   reduced loss rates on our allowance for bad debt. For the second   quarter of fiscal year 2020, we collected $6.1 million of   recoveries, a 26% increase from the same period last fiscal year.   Year-to-date, we have collected $12.5 million and we remain on   track to collect over $20 million in recoveries this fiscal   year.

As our trailing 12-month credit spread demonstrates the   majority of our portfolio, including recent originations, is in   line with our 1,000 basis point annual credit spread target. As a   result, our sophisticated underwriting team continues to analyze   and segment our portfolio to identify and test incremental sales   opportunities.

We remain focused on maintaining a stable credit business and   I am confident in our ability to manage risk going forward, even   as growth accelerates. Positive same-store sales and   non-Hurricane Harvey impacted markets, higher total application   volume and growth in e-commerce sales demonstrates the positive   momentum under way in our business. As a result, we believe we   are well-positioned to achieve total annual retail sales growth   of 8% to 10% in the coming quarters. At this level of growth, we   can manage the credit segment with our 1,000 basis point spread   target while achieving annual retail gross margin of at least 40%   in leveraging SG&A expenses. This is the foundation of a very   powerful and sustainable business model and I am extremely   excited by the opportunities we have in fiscal year 2020 and   beyond.

With this, let me turn the call over to George.

 George L. Bchara    --   Chief Financial Officer 

Thanks Lee. I'm pleased to report results in line with or   better than our guidance across every financial measure. On a   consolidated basis, revenues increased 4.3% to $401.1 million for   the second quarter of this fiscal year from $384.6 million for   the same period last fiscal year. This helped drive an increase   in GAAP net income of 17.4% to $20 million or $0.62 per diluted   share for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 from $17 million   or 53% per diluted share for the prior fiscal year quarter.

On a non-GAAP basis, adjusting for certain charges and credit   and loss from extinguishment of debt, earnings per diluted share   were $0.62 for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 compared to   $0.57 for the same period last fiscal year. Adjusted EBITDA was   $54 million or 13.5% of total revenue for the second quarter of   fiscal year 2020 compared to $50.4 million or 13.1% of total   revenue for the same period last fiscal year. Reconciliations of   GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are available on our second   quarter earnings press release that was issued this morning.

Looking at our retail segment in more detail, total revenues   for the second quarter increased 3.3% to $306.3 million for the   same quarter last fiscal year. Regarding the ongoing trade   negotiations and tariff, our merchandising team in partnership   with our top vendors, has made substantial progress since last   year in diversifying our production outside China and other   affected countries. For goods covered by tariffs, the higher   costs have generally been split between the parties, thereby   limiting the retail increases needed to offset the tariff.   Additional tariffs impacting consumer goods, including   electronics, computers and accessories were announced in early   August. While postponed, we believe this latest round of tariffs,   could have an impact on prices and demand for these products if   they were to go into effect. Retail SG&A expense was $88.1   million, an increase of approximately $5.1 million from the same   quarter in the prior fiscal year, while retail SG&A expense   as a percentage of revenue deleveraged 80 basis points to 28.8%,   primarily due to increased costs for new stores.

I am pleased to announce that our new state-of-the-art Houston   distribution center opened in August. This LEED-certified   facility will increase the capacity and efficiency of our retail   operations within our largest market. Costs will be higher   temporarily as we wind down operations from our legacy Houston   distribution center, which we expect to be completed by the   fourth quarter. In addition, for fiscal year 2020, we plan to   open 14 stores compared to seven stores last fiscal year and only   three stores two years ago. We typically start incurring costs   associated with new stores approximately six months ahead of   opening and there will be additional expenses incurred throughout   the fiscal year as we prepare to open these locations.

I also want to mention, during the second quarter, we   successfully implemented our new ERP system and we are   progressing toward a successful conversion of our new loan   management system, which we expect to be completed during the   third quarter. As you can see, we are making a number of   near-term investments to support our meaningful and long-term   growth plan. This includes higher expenses associated with new   distribution centers as well as investments in SG&A to   support accelerating new store growth and our planned Florida   expansion. While these higher costs will temporarily impact our   overall level of profitability, they are necessary investments as   we continue to expand our retail footprint and grow sales.

Turning to the credit segment, finance charges and other   revenues were a second quarter record of $94.8 million, up 7.5%   from the same period last fiscal year. The increase versus the   second quarter of fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to a 60   basis point increase in the portfolio yield to 21.9% as well as   higher retrospective insurance income compared to the prior   fiscal year period.

Second quarter net annualized charge-offs as a percent of the   average outstanding balance were 13%, an 80 basis point   improvement over the prior fiscal year period. Provision for bad   debts in the credit segment was $49.8 million for the second   quarter of fiscal year 2020, a decrease of approximately $0.8   million from the same period last fiscal year, primarily due to   strong portfolio performance. The allowance for bad debts and   uncollected interest as a percent of the total portfolio was   13.3% at July 31, 2019, which was down approximately 20 basis   points from the prior fiscal year period. SG&A expense in the   credit segment for the second quarter increased 4.4% versus the   same quarter last fiscal year and on an annualized basis as a   percentage of the average customer portfolio balance was 10.2%   compared to 10.1%. The increase in credit SG&A primarily   reflects continued investments we are making in our recovery   effort and an increase in operational expenses to support our   growth. Interest expense for the second quarter was $14.4   million, which declined 7.5% from the same period last fiscal   year, as a result of reductions in our weighted average cost of   funds.

For the second quarter, annualized interest expense as a   percentage of the average portfolio balance was 3.7% compared to   4.2% for the same period last fiscal year. Average net debt as a   percentage of the average portfolio balance was approximately 62%   -- 61% for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 compared to 62%   for the prior fiscal year period. ABS notes currently outstanding   include all classes of our 2019 A and 2018 A notes and the B and   C classes of our 2017 B note. We currently expect to complete one   additional ABS transaction during the current fiscal year.

I am very pleased with the improvements we continue to make in   our capital position. We expect to fund our anticipated growth   through internally generated funds and from our existing capital   sources. As Norm mentioned, through August 29, we have   repurchased a total of 3.1 million shares at an average price of   $18.79 per share, which is approximately 6% below our book value   as of April 30th, 2019.

The total amount repurchased through August 29 under our $75   million share repurchase plan was $57.9 million or 9.6% of our   outstanding shares. During the second quarter, we repurchased   $34.3 million of our common stock and funded the growth of our   customer receivables portfolio while our net debt to adjusted   EBITDA ratio declined. Before opening the call up for questions,   I want to note that we continue to expect our annual effective   tax rate to be between 25% and 27% for the current fiscal   year.

With this overview, Norm, Lee and I are happy to take your   questions. Operator, Please open the call up to question.

 Operator 

Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a   question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first   question comes from the line of John Baugh with Stifel. Please   proceed with your question.

 John A. Baugh    --   Stifel, Nicolus & Company, Inc. -- Analyst 

Thank you. Good morning and congratulations on a good   quarter.

 Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman 

Thank you, John.

 Lee A. Wright    --   Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer 

Good Morning.

 George L. Bchara    --   Chief Financial Officer 

Good Morning.

 John A. Baugh    --   Stifel, Nicolus & Company, Inc. -- Analyst 

What if we could start with Florida and maybe talk a little   bit about how you expect the expenses to ramp there and   importantly, the interest rate cap or regulatory environment   within that state?

 Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman 

Sure, John. I'll start off with the reason we went to Florida   and then I'll hand it to Lee and George to talk about the   SG&A side. Florida obviously is contiguous to our existing   market. So, makes a lot of sense for us. Very attractive from a   rate standpoint. We were able to charge -- it is -- it will be a   state licensed product and we'll be able to charge the 29.99% APR   and so -- and from a demographic standpoint, as you heard in our   comments, there's 21 million people in Florida, a lot of   similarities to the state of Texas from a demographic standpoint.   And we're very bullish about what it bodes from a future sales   standpoint.

 Lee A. Wright    --   Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer 

Yeah, and from an operational standpoint, John, expenses -- as   we mentioned, we've signed a lease with the distribution center   in Central Florida. It gives us that core location for our   logistics build out. We'll start incurring expenses in the fourth   quarter as we go. We'll start opening showrooms in the second   half of next year and ramp that up. Again, obviously, as you   know, when we go into new market, we will have some marketing   expenses as we enter there and make sure we get our brand name   out, but as we talked about and Norm said in the call, very   excited about Florida's long term potential. So from that   standpoint, it's certainly worth the investment, a long-term play   for us, the 40-plus stores we are going to open at the state.

 John A. Baugh    --   Stifel, Nicolus & Company, Inc. -- Analyst 

Great. And then, maybe we could talk again about same-store   sales, and I'm particularly interested in non-Harvey and you've   got, I assume, some building benefit from new stores you opened   over a year ago, offset by some cannibalization because all the   stores have been in existing markets. Could you talk about the   plus and the minus there and maybe how that's influencing numbers   now and how that might change going forward with the Florida   plan?

 Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman 

Yeah, John. So currently, because we didn't open that many   stores, last year seven, there's not many in the comp base. It'll   be the fourth quarter and into the first quarter of next year   when we will start to see that benefit. As you well know,   historically when the Company opened new stores, we would open   them at $8 million to $10 million in revenue in the first year.   We're now averaging between $6 million and $7 million in revenue   because of the tightened underwriting. And those stores, by the   way, are still profitable and pay back in the first year even at   those reduced initial revenue levels, but they will give us   tailwinds in future years. We believe ultimately the stores will   still mature to that $10 million on average from a revenue   standpoint and we should see tailwinds from a three to five-year   timeframe from a comp standpoint that should bode very well for   us in the next year, certainly the back half of next year as   we're lapping the significant number of stores we've added this   year.

 Lee A. Wright    --   Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer 

And John, just a follow up. As you mentioned, ultimately there   will be cannibalization in some of our existing markets as we   open the showrooms in existing states. But obviously, we strongly   believe we've seen it. We grow our overall total sales by market   significantly so it would make sense. As they become a bigger   piece, the cannibalization, we'll look at break that for you as   we used to do in the past.

 John A. Baugh    --   Stifel, Nicolus & Company, Inc. -- Analyst 

Okay. But is there a little bit of a drag in, say, the Q2   numbers and the Q3 expectations from cannibalization   currently?

 Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman 

Very little, John.

 Lee A. Wright    --   Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer 

Yeah.

 John A. Baugh    --   Stifel, Nicolus & Company, Inc. -- Analyst 

Okay. Alright, and my last question, well, I have many more,   but I'll get back in queue, huge increase in applications   processed in Q2, significant turn there. Could you talk about --   what's online, what's maybe a byproduct of -- I am comparing more   to the first quarter where I know you had some challenges with   the new online process. What -- kind of walk through the pieces   of that applications and are you seeing an increase in   applications offline, if you will, in existing non-Harvey   markets? Any way you can slice that? Thank you.

 Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman 

Thanks, John. Yeah, we always really communicated in the past   is our online applications are greater and are growing at a   faster pace than our retail applications. As you know, that's why   we changed our platform. We went through a bit of a bumpy road in   the first quarter as we transition to the new e-commerce   platform, but as we shared at the end of the first quarter, we're   seeing the impact of that new platform, the effectiveness of the   platform and we believe that's reflected not only in e-commerce   sales that Lee touched for the quarter where we were 20% higher   in e-commerce sales for the quarter for what we did the entire   prior year, we believe we're still in the very early innings of   what we can deliver from an omni-channel standpoint as a   retailer. So, very bullish about what the future bodes from both   an application which ultimately translates to sales   standpoint.

 John A. Baugh    --   Stifel, Nicolus & Company, Inc. -- Analyst 

Thank you, good luck.

 Lee A. Wright    --   Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer 

Thanks, John.

 Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman 

Thanks, John.

Our next question comes from the line of Brad Thomas with   KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.

 Bradley B. Thomas    --   Key Banc Capital Markets, Inc. -- Analyst 

Yeah. Thank you. Good morning, Norm, Lee and George, and nice   results here.

 Lee A. Wright    --   Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer 

Thanks, Brad.

 Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman 

Thanks, Brad.

 Bradley B. Thomas    --   Key Banc Capital Markets, Inc. -- Analyst 

I guess, guys, I wanted to zoom in first, maybe on the retail   gross margin and I was hoping you could talk a little bit about   some of the puts and takes as we think about modeling it over the   next couple of quarters, particularly as you think about tariffs   starting to roll in?

 Lee A. Wright    --   Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer 

Yeah, Brad. It's Lee, good morning. So from a retail gross   margin, I think what we tried to stress on the calls, what I   continue to reiterate is that, look, we want to make sure that   we're in that 40-plus retail gross margin range and feel very   comfortable that we can keep it there. Obviously, our it's our   52nd [Phonetic] quarter at or above that rate that we we're   excited about, obviously down year-over-year, but we did talk   about from the standpoint that we did have some of those 4s and   5s [Phonetic] some of the tariffs that came in and we've bought   pre those tariff implementations. So we got a one-time benefit   from that. So, I would just point you back that we feel very   comfortable with that 40% retail gross margin piece and that's   sort of what we guided toward the next quarter in that   standpoint. So from that, yes, we look at it. That's where we   really would continue to point you toward.

 Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman 

And we have some downward pressure because of the logistic   side of the house with the new Houston DC, the opening of the   floor to DC. Both of those will -- we will incur some cost here   as we get those, the old legacy Houston DC closed and the new   floor to DC open, but even with those give and takes, we still   expect to be at or above that 40% margin level.

 Bradley B. Thomas    --   Key Banc Capital Markets, Inc. -- Analyst 

Okay. That's great. And as we think about the new DC and the   store openings, you'll be ramping in for next year, I guess, as   we calibrate our models, you guys are real helpful, kind of one   quarter out, giving us some line items, but as we start to think   about the fourth quarter and some of these costs coming in, any   more quantification or color you could share with us on how to   think about SG&A and some of the ramp in expenses?

 George L. Bchara    --   Chief Financial Officer 

Yeah. Hey, Brad. This is George. I would tell you that as we   continue to open up increasing new stores year-over-year. So this   year we're planning to open 14 stores compared to seven last year   and we talked about opening even more stores next year. We will   continue to see some deleveraging from an SG&A   standpoint.

 Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman 

But as we get to that consistent run rate basis, you'll then   start to see the leveraging from an SG&A.

 Lee A. Wright    --   Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer 

Yeah.

 Bradley B. Thomas    --   Key Banc Capital Markets, Inc. -- Analyst 

Okay, OK. And if I could squeeze one more in here, just on the   comments around the lease to own, that had been growing pretty   nicely the last few quarters and took kind of a step back   sequentially. I mean if you had been in line in 2Q with where it   was as a percentage of sales in 1Q, looks like comp sort of ended   up [Phonetic] about two points better. I guess, could you help us   think about -- maybe how much of a headwind that was for you here   in 2Q, is -- would 2% be a reasonable estimate?

 Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman 

I think that's reasonable, Brad, and -- but what I would say   is and as we shared in the prepared comments, it was really   driven predominantly by our partner and some things they did, not   specific to Conn's, but overall from an underwriting standpoint.   Having said that, hasn't shaken what our belief is long term on   the lease-to-own opportunities that we have. Remember, in the   past 12 months, we had 1.2 million applications submitted from a   Conn standpoint, both in-house and online and approximately   700,000 were approved, which means about 500,000 are declined. So   that speaks to the magnitude of the opportunities that exist for   us to capture and get to that, why we remain very bullish on our   ability ultimately to get to that 10% balance of sale, not at the   expense of other elements of financing, but by growing the   overall size of the pie.

 Bradley B. Thomas    --   Key Banc Capital Markets, Inc. -- Analyst 

Great. Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from the line of Rick Nelson with   Stephens. Please proceed with your question.

 Rick Nelson    --   Stephens Inc. -- Analyst 

Thanks. Good morning, guys.

 Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman 

Good morning.

 George L. Bchara    --   Chief Financial Officer 

Good morning.

 Lee A. Wright    --   Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer 

Morning, Rick.

 Rick Nelson    --   Stephens Inc. -- Analyst 

Looking at spread between Harvey and non-Harvey markets, same   store --- [Indecipherable] 11% you are guiding to a 6% spread at   the midpoint for 3Q. Do you think that spread goes away in the   fourth quarter? What is the timing you think there?

 Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman 

Yeah, we think it will be negligible in the fourth quarter,   Rick. We don't anticipate breaking out Harvey and non-Harvey in   the fourth quarter.

 Rick Nelson    --   Stephens Inc. -- Analyst 

Okay, gotcha. And the accelerating new store growth that you   referenced, is that number of units or is that percentage growth   rate (Speech Overlap].

 George L. Bchara    --   Chief Financial Officer 

The number of units.

 Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman 

Number of units.

 George L. Bchara    --   Chief Financial Officer 

Number of unit.

 Rick Nelson    --   Stephens Inc. -- Analyst 

Gotcha. And e-com, can you discuss the economics there? The   lost rate, it's interesting you referred to the store's showroom?   Do you see over the long haul, online sales accounting for a   substantial proportion of your volume?

 Lee A. Wright    --   Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer 

Well, Rick, so first of all, thanks for the call out on   showrooms. We're excited about the look and feel of our new   showrooms and existing showrooms, and I know you'll be down here   to see what our new showroom. So -- but with regard to the   e-commerce, obviously very pleased to see that we were --   actually our e-commerce revenues 20% [Phonetic] all of last year.   Certainly believe it should be a material percentage of sales,   but we really do believe that's going to be incremental sales on   top of there'll be some cannibalization that mostly new customers   able to come on. And as you referenced, we certainly are very   careful from an underwriting perspective is why we took so long   to actually offer a true omni-channel online e-commerce   experience. Look, with John Davis and team, we certainly have the   sophistication to do the proper underwriting and not take any   excessive losses. So we are excited about that going forward.

 Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman 

And just as you've seen, Rick, on our new stores, our FTDs   continue to run. They're lower than the portfolio average. From   an underwriting standpoint online, we're well aware of the risk   associated with the online consumer versus the retail in-person   consumer. So we're taking appropriate steps from an underwriting   standpoint to ensure that as we've stated, any business, that we   underwrite, always with the risk mindset of maintaining that   1,000 basis points of credit spreads.

 Rick Nelson    --   Stephens Inc. -- Analyst 

Okay, that's good. And I thought, the Florida expansion also   interesting. Any thoughts on how many stores you could open   across the country?

 Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman 

I know that in the past there's been numbers thrown out there,   prefer at this point not to. It is materially by several factors   bigger than what our store base is now. Out of the 50 states,   when you look at attractiveness from a from a high APR being in   the high 20s APR, there's 35 plus states that give us that   opportunity right off the bat. So when you're only in 14 of them   and Florida is obviously one, California is one and a number of   other high population states give us that opportunity in addition   to where we're at now. So, we believe we can grow at that 8% to   10% top line revenue growth for many, many years from a growth   standpoint, because our customer -- our core customer demographic   is in every city, every town, every state of the United States.   They represent about 20% of the US population. So, the potential   future growth is enormous for the Company.

 Rick Nelson    --   Stephens Inc. -- Analyst 

By sustaining [Indecipherable] that proportion of the   population actually would grow in a downturn?

 Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman 

That has been historically --a number of the members of the   senior leadership team, including myself and Lee and JD, have   operated in sub prime for a number of years. We've been in it in   various economic cycles and downturns. And, although there is   some impact when there is a recession, there is also a   significant opportunity that presents itself as well as more   customers enter into our core focus or demographic. So -- we   don't -- from a recessionary standpoint or a cycle standpoint, we   are aware of that, but it gives us as much opportunities as it   does the challenges that would be presented in a down cycle.

 Rick Nelson    --   Stephens Inc. -- Analyst 

Got it. Thanks for the color and good luck.

 Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman 

Thanks, Rick.

 Lee A. Wright    --   Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer 

Thanks, Rick.

Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Joseph with   Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.

 Kyle Joseph    --   Jefferies, LLC -- Analyst 

Hey, good morning, guys. Most of my questions have been asked.   Just to follow up on credit and I can wait for the queue for   this, but just to get a sense of the charge of decline   year-over-year, is that primarily from the better recoveries or   are you also basically looking for some color on frequency versus   severity in terms of losses?

 Lee A. Wright    --   Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer 

Yeah, certainly recoveries had an impact. We've been excited   about the ramp up and continued pace of our recovery effort. And   so that's the material piece, Kyle.

 Kyle Joseph    --   Jefferies, LLC -- Analyst 

And then from from a frequency perspective, I know you guys   talked about first payment default management at new stores, but   can you give us any sort of sense of what trends you're seeing   there?

 Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman 

Continue to be very pleased with 60-day plus delinquencies and   for FTDs, which as you know, Kyle, are the two leading indicators   of what the quality and the strength of the portfolio is. So this   year and going forward, we're not going to see the significant   increases we saw in past years because we're close to that 1,000   basis point spread and as we hit that and we achieve that, we'll   take associated incremental risk to maintain the 1,000 basis   points, but also give us retail opportunity. So, the target here   going forward, you shouldn't see significant fluctuations there   because we're within that range. So, we're targeting spread   wise.

 Kyle Joseph    --   Jefferies, LLC -- Analyst 

That's it for me. Thanks very much for answering my   question.

 Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman 

Thanks a lot, John.

 Operator 

And our next question comes from the line of Bill Ryan with   Compass Point. Please proceed with your question.

 William Ryan    --   Compass Point Research & Trading -- Analyst 

Thanks and good morning. A couple of questions. First, there's   obviously been a reduction in market interest rates and you   talked about doing one more securitization this year and you're   obviously going to be rolling some of the prior deals. Do you see   an opportunity with a reduction in market rates that the funding   costs might actually come down a little bit further as we   progress over the next few quarters? And secondly, going back to   the disparity between the implementation of the tariffs and the   pricing changes that you implemented, because obviously you had   an outsized retail gross margin in Q4 last year. I want to kind   of get some anticipate -- what you anticipate of what Q4, the   retail gross margin might look like. Thanks.

 George L. Bchara    --   Chief Financial Officer 

Hey, Bill, this is George. With respect to your first question   around interest rates, our ABL is tied to LIBOR rates. So   certainly as market rates come down, it is possible that we would   see reductions in our interest rate as a result. And then, with   respect to the second question on tariffs, I mean, we continue to   guide and feel comfortable with our 40 basis -- 40% retail gross   margin throughout the back half of the year.

 Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman 

Now, you are right, Bill, that the fourth quarter was   elevated. So, it's typically our highest quarter from from a   margin standpoint. One of our higher quarters. So -- but we don't   expect to probably be at that level. We haven't guided for   quarter four yet, but it won't be at that elevated level because   of some of the tariff and some other things -- one-time things   that occurred in that fourth quarter, but still above that 40%   for certain.

 William Ryan    --   Compass Point Research & Trading -- Analyst 

Okay. One last thing. In terms of lease-to-own, obviously,   some competitors introduced a lease-to-own product earlier this   year. Just want to kind of get an idea, are you seeing any   incremental competition on the lease-to-own product as well in   your stores?

 Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman 

On a very limited basis, Bill. I mean, our expectation is   ultimately probably every retailer will have some lease-to-own   product, every bricks and mortar retailer. Remember, our customer   and the ones we're attracting now, very different than what the   prime customer is targeting and attracting which is why out of   the 1.2 million applications we get, 500,000 we decline as I   mentioned earlier. So the pool we have from an opportunity to   grow our lease-to-own and to capture that 10% is within our walls   right now, even if we lose some small piece of that. And   remember, our financing is 2.5 times to 3 times better or less   expensive for a customer if they can qualify for our Conn's   financing versus having to move to a lease-to-own option.

 William Ryan    --   Compass Point Research & Trading -- Analyst 

All right. Thank you.

 Lee A. Wright    --   Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer 

Thanks, Bill.

 Norman Miller    --   President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman 

Thanks. Bill.

After all, who wouldn't want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value? One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let's put PolyOne Corporation POL  stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:  PE Ratio  A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar o f earnings  in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock's current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole. On this front, PolyOne Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13.28, as you can see in the chart below:    This level actually compares quite favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 18.02. Also, if we focus on the long-term PE trend, PolyOne Corporation's current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 17.83 over the past five years.    The stock's PE compares quite favorably with the Basic Materials Market's trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 13.98. This indicates that the stock is undervalued right now, compared to its peers.    Meanwhile, PolyOne Corporation has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year's earnings) of 12.58, which slightly lower than the current level. So, it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for PolyOne Corporation stock in the near term too.  P/S Ratio  Another key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock's price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings. Right now, PolyOne Corporation has a P/S ratio of just 0.71. This is quite lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.17x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.     Broad Value Outlook  In aggregate, PolyOne Corporation currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes PolyOne Corporation a solid choice for value investors and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too. For example, the PEG ratio for PolyOne Corporation is 1.30, a level that is lower than the industry average of 1.88.

2019-09-03 10:41:00,"By Lucia Mutikani

WASHINGTON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity contracted for the first time in three years in August, with new orders and hiring declining sharply as trade tensions weighed on business confidence, raising financial market fears of a recession.

Concerns about the economy, which is in its longest expansion ever, were also exacerbated by other data on Tuesday showing construction spending barely rising in July. The reports somewhat offset last week's upbeat data on consumer spending that had suggested that while the economy was slowing, it was not losing momentum as rapidly as financial markets were flagging.

""The canary in the mine may be falling off its perch,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""With manufacturing now starting to contract, it is even more critical that the consumer keeps spending.""

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity dropped to a reading of 49.1 last month from 51.2 in July. A reading below 50 indicates contraction in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for about 12% of the U.S. economy. Last month marked the first time since August 2016 that the index broke below the 50 threshold.

August's reading was also the lowest since January 2016 and was the fifth straight monthly decline in the index. The United States now joins the euro zone, Japan, the United Kingdom and China, which have long been experiencing a contraction in factory activity.

Still, the ISM index remains above the 43 level, which economists associate with a recession. The U.S.-China trade tensions also coincide with diminishing stimulus from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut package.

The ISM said there had been ""a notable decrease in business confidence,"" adding that ""trade remains the most significant issue, indicated by the strong contraction in new export orders."" Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the ISM index would slip to 51.0 in August.

The U.S.-China trade fight is eroding business sentiment, with business investment contracting in the second quarter for the first time in more than three years. That, together with an inventory bloat, is undercutting manufacturing, with output declining for two straight quarters.

Consumers have largely shrugged off the trade dispute and continued to spend, propping up the economy. But that could change with the trade war spilling over to shopping malls.

A new round of U.S. tariffs on imports of Chinese goods, mostly consumer products like clothing, footwear and televisions, took effect on Sept. 1. Additional U.S. tariffs are due to be imposed in December.

With trade tensions simmering in the background, the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates again this month to keep the economic expansion, now in its 11th year, on track.

The Fed lowered its short-term interest rate by 25 basis points in July for the first time since 2008, citing trade tensions and slowing global growth. Financial markets have fully priced in another quarter-percentage-point cut at the Fed's Sept. 17-18 policy meeting.

U.S. Treasury prices rose on the factory data, with the yield in the benchmark 10-year note dropping to its lowest since July 2016. The Treasury yield curve has inverted, signaling that a recession is looming. Stocks on Wall Street fell, while the dollar  was little changed against a basket of currencies. 

ORDERS TUMBLE

The ISM's forward-looking new orders sub-index dropped to a reading of 47.2 last month, the lowest level since June 2012, from 50.8 in July. A measure of export orders plunged 4.8 points to the lowest level since April 2009.

The survey's factory employment tumbled to 47.4, the weakest reading since March 2016, from 51.7 in July. This raises the risk that factory payrolls contracted in August. Manufacturers cut hours in July, pushing the factory workweek to its lowest level since November 2011. Factories also cut overtime in July.

The government will publish August's employment report on Friday.

""This (ISM) report is a warning that the tariff and trade uncertainty is continuing to weigh on manufacturing activity, and that this uncertainty is a growing risk to the expansion,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

The ISM said nine industries, including furniture and related products, machinery and chemical products reported growth last month. Transportation equipment, primary metals and electrical equipment, appliances and components were among the seven industries reporting a contraction.

Machinery manufacturers said ""business is starting to show signs of a broad slowdown."" Electrical equipment, appliances and components makers complained that ""tariffs continue to be a strain on the supply chain and the economy overall.""

That sentiment resonated across all industries.  Manufacturers of furniture and related products said ""incoming sales seem to be slowing down, and this is usually our busiest season.""

""The story up until now has been global manufacturing recession, with the U.S. standing out as the strongest among the weakening players,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York. ""The White House could help enormously by delaying further escalation of the trade conflict.""

In a separate report on Tuesday, the Commerce Department said construction spending edged up 0.1% in July. Data for June was revised up to show construction outlays decreasing 0.7 instead of falling 1.3% as previously reported.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending would rise 0.3% in July. Construction spending fell 2.7% on a year-on-year basis in July.

2019-09-03 07:00:11,"Bitcoin (BTC) is flashing green at press time, while its share   of the crypto   currency market    has reached at 30-month highs above 70 percent.

As of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $10,350 on   Bitstamp - up 6 percent on a 24-hour basis - after hitting   an eight-day high of $10,506 earlier today. At that level, BTC   was up 12.7 percent from the one-month low of $9,320 hit on Aug.   29.

Over the last nine weeks, BTC has consistently found takers in   the range of $9,000-$10,000. The resulting recovery rallies,   however, ended up creating lower highs - a sign of bull market   exhaustion - as seen in the chart below.

 Related: Bitcoin Averts Bearish Trend Change But Stalls     Beneath Key Price Average 

The question now is whether the latest recovery from   sub-$10,000 levels will invalidate the bearish lower-highs setup   with a move above $10,956.

The gains seen in the last four days look sustainable and   could be extended further, as BTC's dominance rate - the   cryptocurrency's share of the total crypto market - has jumped to   70.10 percent, the highest level since March 2017, according to      CoinMarketCap    .

The gauge stood at 69 percent on Aug. 29, when BTC's price   slipped to one-month lows below $9,400.

 Related: Top 10 Cryptocurrencies Now Trading Below     200-Day Price Averages 

Many observers consider price gains sustainable if they are   backed by a rise in the dominance rate,   as discussed    last month. The shift indicates money is being poured into BTC   for the long haul and not to fund purchases of alternative   cryptocurrencies.

Trading volumes, however, tell another story, and suggest the   recovery seen in the last four days could be short-lived.

The green bars (buying volumes) seen in the last four days on   the hourly chart (above left) are smaller compared to the red   bars (selling volumes) seen during bitcoin's drop to one-month   lows on Aug.29.

Buying volumes only ticked up slightly in the 60 minutes to   21:00 UTC yesterday. During that time frame, BTC rose from   $10,200 to $10,470. Further,  Sunday's green bar (above   right) is significantly smaller than those observed during   previous breakouts above $10,000 (marked by arrows).

Put simply, the price bounce seen in the last four days lacks   substance and a pullback, possibly to $9,750. could be in the   offing in the next day or two.

The outlook as per the daily chart would turn bullish if   prices print a UTC close above $10,956 on high buying volumes.   That would open the doors to $12,000.

The bitcoin bulls have failed four times in the last 10 weeks   to secure a weekly close (Sunday, UTC) above $12,000. Meanwhile,   the sellers have failed persistently failed to keep prices below   $9,500.

A downside break looks likely, as key indicators have turned   bearish, including a bearish crossover of 5- and 10-week   moving averages.

The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram has   also dropped below zero for the first time since February, while   the Chaikin money flow, which incorporates both prices and   trading volumes, has slipped to a 4.5-month low of 0.10, a sign   of weakening bullish pressures.

2019-09-03 07:51:00,"Many years from now, it's quite possible investors will look back on the cannabis industry as this generation's greatest growth trend . After the industry logged $3.4 billion in legal global sales in 2014, Wall Street forecast sales of anywhere from $50 billion to as high as $200 billion by 2029/2030. That's a robust double-digit annual growth percentage that's bound to get Wall Street and investors excited.

Then again, the past couple of months have been anything but exciting for marijuana stocks investors. With few exceptions , pot stocks have been taken to the woodshed since April began, with supply issues in Canada and high tax rates in recreationally legal U.S. states weighing on their performance. Of course, for one Wall Street firm, this weakness looks like the opportunity to buy.

Image source: Getty Images.

Last week, investment firm Seaport Global upgraded the largest marijuana stock in the world by market cap, Canopy Growth (NYSE: CGC) . Shares of Canopy have shed more than half of their value since late April, which Seaport believes provides an intriguing opportunity for investors. Covering analyst Brett Hundley lifted Canopy Growth's rating to buy from neutral, and set a target price of $31, representing about 25% upside from when the rating was changed.

According to Hundley and his firm in a research note sent out to clients, the bar is ""increasingly achievable"" for Canopy, with the North American cannabis industry providing a safety net for the company. As a refresher, Canopy Growth has legally pushed into the U.S. hemp market via a hemp-processing license in New York state, as well as the acquisition of ebbu, a Colorado-based intellectual property (IP) company with IP for cannabis- and hemp-based products.

Furthermore, Hundley opines that Canopy's cash position gives it an edge over its peers. The company ended its most recent quarter with almost $2.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents , which is far more than every other pot stock, with the exception of Cronos Group , which has less cash than Canopy but quite the war chest of its own. Said Hundley, ""In addition, forecasted cash for Canopy cannot be valued on a 1-for-1 basis; it will likely be multiplicative.""

Considering Canopy's groundbreaking equity investment from Constellation Brandsfor $4 billion , as well as its more than 70,000 kilos of domestic supply deals and its push into the U.S., I can understand why Seaport is bullish. Unfortunately, I still believe Hundley and his team are jumping the gun on Canopy Growth.

Image source: Getty Images.

Even though Seaport Global admits that it has tempered its sales and profit projections in the near term, it's as if it's overlooking the importance of operating results. With Canada legalizing recreational weed, operating results actually matter now. And there's absolutely no sugarcoating the fact that Canopy's quarterly reports have been awful . In the most recent quarter, Canopy's cannabis sales were more or less flat yet again, while its gross margin retraced all the way to 15%. As potentially one of the last major marijuana stocks to push into recurring profitability, Canopy certainly doesn't look like a buy on a fundamental basis.

To build on this point, it's also worth noting that Canada's supply issues aren't a quick fix. Regulatory agency Health Canada has been bogged down by hundreds of cultivation, processing, and sales applications, and despite changes to the cultivation application process , it's going to take a number of quarters for the agency to whittle down its backlog. Between this application backlog, a shortage of compliant packaging, and select provinces being slow to open physical licensed cannabis stores, there's no immediate remedy to Canopy Growth's supply issues.

There's also nothing on the immediate horizon to suggest that the U.S. is going to change its cannabis policy at the federal level. Although medical marijuana is legal in 33 states, and 11 have passed legislation allowing adult-use consumption, Canopy can't partake in state-level marijuana growth, given that it would jeopardize its listing status on the New York Stock Exchange. As long as Republicans control the Senate -- or I should more specifically say, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) remains Senate Majority Leader -- all cannabis reform bills will fail to move forward . That means less of an impact from the U.S. in the near-to-intermediate term.

Image source: Getty Images.

Investors also can't overlook the fact that Canopy Growth doesn't have a permanent solution at CEO right now. The company's visionary, Bruce Linton, was fired as co-CEO in early July , and acting CEO Mark Zekulin will be stepping down once Canopy's board has found a permanent leader. With Constellation Brands essentially packing Canopy's board with two of its own execs and two independent directors, Canopy Growth has gone from a gung-ho marijuana growth stock to a company without any potential leadership from the pot industry.

Finally, I believe it's important to recognize that while Canopy Growth has done a very good job of establishing a production, research, or export presence in more than a dozen international markets , these overseas ventures aren't likely to pay off until domestic demand is satisfied. And given the many supply issues noted above, it could be a while before that happens.

Canopy Growth may have a handful of well-known brands and a healthy (yet shrinking) cash pile, but there's little meat on the bone for fundamentally focused investors to get excited about. Canopy has the opportunity to be great one day, but it's simply not worthy of a buy rating right now.

Here's The Marijuana Stock You've Been Waiting For A little-known Canadian company just unlocked what some experts think could be the key to profiting off the coming marijuana boom. 

And make no mistake - it is coming.

Cannabis legalization is sweeping over North America - 10 states plus Washington, D.C., have all legalized recreational marijuana over the last few years, and full legalization came to Canada in October 2018.

And one under-the-radar Canadian company is poised to explode from this coming marijuana revolution.

Because a game-changing deal just went down between the Ontario government and this powerhouse company...and you need to hear this story today if you have even considered investing in pot stocks.

","Wall Street Just Upgraded This Cannabis Stock, but It's Far From a Buy - Nasdaq.com",https://www.nasdaq.com/article/wall-street-just-upgraded-this-cannabis-stock-but-its-far-from-a-buy-cm1206790
2019-09-03 11:32:16,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

In late January 2018, U.S. President Donald Trump announced tariffs on solar panels and washing machines from China, officially starting the U.S.-China trade war. That was 19 months ago. Over the subsequent 19 months, the stock market has gone nowhere. The S&P 500 peaked at 2,870 in late January 2018. Nineteen months later, at the end of August 2019, the S&P 500 is at 2,870.

That isn't a coincidence. The U.S.-China trade war has created a flat market. Why? Because no one is sure exactly how this volatile trade war will play out, and how it does play out will have profound implications on the global economy. Either the U.S. and China come to a trade resolution, the trade war ends and global economic activity ramps back up (and stocks fly higher), or they don't, the trade war drags on, and corporate uncertainty drags the global economy into a recession (and stocks plunge).

As such, until investors have clarity as to which way the trade war will swing, the stock market will likely remain flat. At the current moment, the most likely scenario is for trade war uncertainty to persist, and for the stock market to remain stuck in neutral.

How do investors make money in a flat market? It's pretty simple. Look for three things.

One, look for stocks that have been working in this flat market. Two, look for stocks with minimal exposure to the market's big headwind, which today is the trade war. Three, look for stocks with plenty of long-term growth potential - enough long-term growth potential that investors are willing to ignore near-term noise for the promise of long-term gain once the noise passes.

With that in mind, let's take a look at a list of seven stocks to buy in this flat market.

% Gain Over Last 19 Months:  215%

Exposure to China:  Minimal

Revenue CAGR Estimate over Next Two Years (from YCharts ):  35%

Up first, we have one of the market's hottest socks, e-commerce solutions provider Shopify (NYSE: SHOP ).

SHOP stock checks off all the boxes you'd want it to check off in a flat market. The stock has more than tripled since the trade war started, so clearly the stock is working. It's working because Shopify has very little exposure to China, so the growth trajectory has remained robust despite escalating trade tensions (Shopify's revenue growth rates have remained in excess of 45% in each of the past several quarters). Further, Shopify controls less than 2% of global retail sales, and given current consumer trends promoting do-it-yourself mentalities and economic decentralization , it's easy to see Shopify running up toward 5-10% share in the long run.

That means that this growth narrative is just getting started. That's why analysts see Shopify growing revenues at a 35% compounded annual growth rate over the next two years.

In other words, with Shopify, you have a big growth stock that has been on fire over the past 19 months, has minimal exposure to the U.S.-China trade war and which has tons of long-term growth potential. That's a winning combination in a flat market.

% Gain Over Last 19 Months:  240%

Exposure to China: Minimal

Revenue CAGR Estimate over Next Two Years (from YCharts): 33%

Shopify stock has been red hot over the past 19 months, but Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU ) stock has been even hotter.

Roku stock is up 240% since the trade war started, mostly because this company is supported by secular growth tailwinds, which have remained vigorous despite escalating trade tensions. That is, consumers in the U.S. are still shifting in bulk from linear to internet TV. At the same time, media companies everywhere are still launching multiple streaming services. Thus, both supply and demand in the streaming TV market are still rapidly rising, meaning that there remains robust demand for a streaming service aggregator like Roku to connect all the demand in the streaming TV world to all the supply, in a seamless, friction-less and low-cost manner.

Consequently, Roku has fired off huge user engagement and revenue growth rates over the past several quarters. As it has, ROKU stock has popped.

Meanwhile, Roku has very little exposure to China, with the only exposure really being that they manufacture their streaming devices in China. But, the hardware part of this business is largely irrelevant to the software side, so hardware manufacturing exposure to China is a null point in the big picture. Further, Roku only has 30 million active streamers. There are over a billion internet households in the world, meaning that Roku is still a long runway ahead of it for future growth - hence the 30%-plus revenue CAGR projected over the next two years.

Net net, Roku - much like Shopify - has been red hot during the trade war, has minimal exposure to China, and projects as a big grower for a lot longer. Again, that's a winning combination, which should continue to produce gains in a flat market.

Up nearly 400% over the past 19 months, programmatic advertising leader The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD ) checks off all the boxes you'd want checked off for a winning stock in a flat market.

First, TTD has risen nearly five-fold over since early 2018. That's a huge gain. Clearly, whatever this company is doing, it's working.

Second, what The Trade Desk is doing - providing programmatic advertising solutions to automate and optimize the ad spend process by leveraging data and machine learning - is revolutionary. Indeed, it's already disrupting the entire ad industry, as companies left and right are adopting TTD's automated ad spend solutions. Still, the ~$2.4 billion of ad spend that flowed through TTD's platform in 2018 amounted to less than 1% of total digital ad spend globally . Thus, the runway for growth here is very long and very big.

Third, TTD has minimal exposure to China. International gross billings amounted to just 15% of total gross billings in 2018. While that number will grow over time - and while China could one day be a huge market for TTD - The Trade Desk presently lacks meaningful exposure to China, meaning that weakness in China won't show up in TTD's numbers.

Overall, then, TTD stock is a stock that has outperformed big in this flat market, has big growth potential in the long run, and lacks meaningful exposure to China - a trio of winning features that should keep TTD stock on an uptrend in this flat market.

Digital education leader Chegg (NASDAQ: CHGG ) has been less hot compared to many of the other stocks on this list, but it still checks off all the boxes of a winning stock in a flat market.

First, CHGG stock is up big since the trade war started, more than doubling over that stretch as the company has powered consistently favorable results that comprise big subscriber, revenue and profit growth.

Second, CHGG stock lacks trade war exposure. This is a U.S. company, which services U.S. high school and college students. The U.S.-China trade war has zero impact on those students, or their willingness to spend on Chegg's digital education service. Thus, it's fair to say that Chegg has zero trade war exposure.

Third, CHGG stock is far from being done growing. The platform has 3.1 million subscribers. There are 36 million high school and college students in America. That means Chegg is at roughly 8% market penetration. Further, Chegg has very little competition in that market, and is supported by secular demographic trends such as the fact that most Generation Z students prefer to learn online . As such, all signs point to the fact that Chegg is in the first few inning of a long-term growth narrative that will result in 20%-plus profit growth for a lot longer.

All in all, CHGG stock - like all the other stocks on this list - has all the attributes of a winning stock in a flat market. As such, so long as the market remains flat due to trade war concerns, Chegg stock is a good place to hangout.

One of the market's favorite growth stocks over the past 19 months - cloud identity management company Okta (NASDAQ: OKTA ), up more than 300% since the trade war started - has turned into a market favorite for good reason.

First, Okta's secular growth narrative is very promising. Okta's Identity Cloud is a unique identity-focused approach to cloud security, wherein Okta outfits each employee in an enterprise with their own ""identity armor"" as opposed to outfitting the ecosystem with a ""security castle"". The logic is that if everyone in an ecosystem has armor, there's no need to build a castle around the ecosystem - everyone is safe. And, without a castle, individuals are unrestricted and can move freely - this enhanced flexibility is increasingly important in enterprise ecosystems with multiple software applications.

Consequently, enterprises have been quick to adopt Okta's Identity Cloud. But, Okta is still a small company, with revenues projected at just $550 million this year. Global cybersecurity spend amounts to over $100 billion every single year. Thus, Okta has plenty of room to grow its share in the cybersecurity market in the long run.

Second, Okta's secular growth narrative has very little do with China. At least for now. Less than 20% of revenue comes from outside of America, and of that 20%, China is such a small part that it wasn't mentioned once in either the company's most recent annual report or most recent conference call. Further, even if the U.S.-China trade war dampens global corporate investment, one thing corporations are  not  likely to cut back on is security spend.

Consequently, with OKTA stock, you have a red hot stock that is supported by robust secular growth tailwinds which are largely unaffected by the U.S.-China trade war. That's a winning combination in today's flat market.

% Gain Over Last 19 Months:  75%

Exposure to China: None

Revenue CAGR Estimate over Next Two Years (from YCharts): 15%

Another high-growth U.S. technology company that looks like a good buy in a trade war afflicted market is Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ).

First, and foremost, Twitter has no China exposure. The Twitter platform is blocked in China, and all of the platform's users are from outside of China. Thus, U.S.-China trade war turbulence shouldn't have any impact on the user base, and it likely won't have much impact on the ad business until business uncertainty escalates to the point where they start cutting ad spend - and we appear to be far from that point today.

Second, Twitter has been on fire over the past near two years. The company's revenue growth rates have come surging back, and have remained vigorous as the company has figured out how to optimally advertise on its platform. Meanwhile, user growth trends have been stable, and margins have tracked higher alongside big revenue growth, thereby powering huge profit growth. Alongside this big profit growth, TWTR stock has flown higher - to the tune of a 75% gain since the trade war started in early 2018.

Third, Twitter still has a lot of growth firepower left. The company is a 1% (and expanding) share player in a secular growth global digital ad market projected to grow at a double-digit rate for the foreseeable future. That combination of share expansion and double-digit market growth implies that mid-teens revenue growth is achievable over the next several years, which is what analysts are modeling for. On top of that, operating margins are just 14%, versus over 30% at Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), so Twitter has plenty of runway to drive further positive operating leverage in the long run.

Big picture, Twitter has very minimal exposure to the trade war, has been on fire lately in terms of growth and share price appreciation, and has plenty of room to keep growing at a big pace for a lot longer. Those are the exact features which investors will continue to be attracted to in a flat market.

% Gain Over Last 19 Months:  400%

Revenue CAGR Estimate over Next Two Years (from YCharts): 30%

Last, but not least, on this list of hot stocks to buy in a flat market is cloud communications leader Twilio (NASDAQ: TWLO ).

As with all the other stocks on this list, Twilio checks off all the right boxes. Red hot stock? Check. TWLO stock is up 400% since the trade war begun, thanks to a series of consecutive beat-and-raise reports. Minimal exposure to China? Check. Only a quarter of revenue comes from outside of the U.S.

Big growth potential? Check. Every company is integrating cloud communications into their customer experiences, and as they do, Twilio's revenue growth trajectory will remain robust for the next several years - hence analysts expecting a 30% revenue CAGR here over the next two years.

Net net, Twilio is a winning stock in a flat market. It projects to remain so for the foreseeable future, too.

As of this writing, Luke Lango was long SHOP, ROKU, TTD, CHGG and OKTA.

SAO PAULO, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Brazilian automaker CAOA reached an initial agreement to buy Ford Motor Co's plant in Sao Bernardo do Campo, the companies said on Tuesday, but CAOA could slash 1,300 jobs, according to the union representing the plant's workers. 

Ford announced in February that it would shut down the plant, its oldest in Brazil, which employs some 3,000 workers, as part of a global restructuring and a push to exit the heavy truck business. 

Wagner Santana, president of the union that represents Ford's workers, told reporters that in conversations with CAOA, the Brazilian automaker said it would initially retain only some 800 workers and that 1,300 would be let go, with the remainder being kept by Ford. 

Doria has defended Sao Paulo as a manufacturing hub at a time when the auto industry turned to other Brazilian states that were offering aggressive tax incentives. He has introduced a tax incentive of his own. 

At the news conference, Doria said a decision on how many jobs will be kept can only be made once Ford and CAOA close the sale, which is set to go through a 45-day due diligence process. 

""Preserve all jobs, that's the fundamental condition for a contribution from the state,"" Doria said, in reference to potential tax benefits. 

Santana said CAOA plans to pay those it hires up to 80% of their current Ford salaries, noting that is still much more than salaries paid in other states. 

A CAOA spokesperson declined to comment.  

""The objective is to make the factory profitable and productive, so it generates employment and riches,"" said Carlos Alberto Oliveira Andrade, CAOA's president and founder, whose initials make up the company name. 

Brazil's large domestic market and protectionist economy has long attracted the world's biggest automakers to set up shop here, and CAOA is the rare carmaker that is actually domestically owned. It has struck deals to make cars for Korea's Hyundai and co-owns China's Chery operation in Brazil, whose cars are branded as CAOA Chery.

Ford opened the plant in 1967, and it is the company's oldest in the country. It was primarily used to make heavy trucks, as well as the compact Ford Fiesta, a sales laggard. Ford is undergoing a global restructuring and has said it would focus on a much newer plant in the Northeastern state of Bahia.",Brazil automaker CAOA signs preliminary agreement to buy Ford plant - Nasdaq.com,https://www.nasdaq.com/article/brazil-automaker-caoa-signs-preliminary-agreement-to-buy-ford-plant-20190903-01037

BRUSSELS, Sept 3 (Reuters) - China'sHuawei Technologies  on Tuesday said the U.S. government had instructed law enforcement to ""coerce"" and ""entice"" its employees to turn against the company, as it steps up its pushback against a U.S. campaign that could threaten its survival.

Huawei made its assertions in a news release on Tuesday and in an undated document seen by Reuters.

Huawei on Tuesday said the U.S. government was using its judicial and administrative powers as well as other means to disrupt its business and that of its partners.

A Justice Department spokesman said that while they do not comment on specific investigations, ""in all matters, our investigative techniques comply with the law and all subjects of investigations enjoy the same rights to due process afforded by our Constitution and safeguarded by an independent judiciary.""

Huawei said in its public statement that staff and Huawei partners were subjected to unlawful searches, detention and arrest while some employees were visited by FBI agents at their homes and pressured to collect information on the company.

According to the Huawei document, eight employees, several of them U.S. citizens, were involved in the incidents. All of them are mid- to high-level executives. The latest incident happened on Aug. 28 when an employee from Huawei's U.S. office informed the company of a visit from the FBI asking the person to be an informant.

The Justice Department said the FBI would not have a separate comment.

Huawei did not provide any evidence for its accusations, saying that their employees had reported them to the company. Reuters could not independently confirm the information provided by Huawei.

Since the start of this year, at least three U.S. employees have been contacted by U.S. law enforcement agencies, the Huawei document said.

Beyond the accusations of putting pressure on its employees, Huawei also claimed that the U.S. government was launching cyber attacks on the company and mobilising companies that work with Huawei to bring unsubstantiated accusations. The document did not provide specific details about these efforts.

The company also accused U.S. authorities of selectively launching criminal investigations based on civil cases that have already been settled and filing criminal charges based on claims of technology theft.

""The fact remains that none of Huawei's core technology has been the subject of any criminal case brought against the company, and none of the accusations levied by the U.S. government have been supported with sufficient evidence,"" the company said.","Huawei says U.S. enticing, coercing staff to provide company info - Nasdaq.com",https://www.nasdaq.com/article/huawei-says-us-enticing-coercing-staff-to-provide-company-info-20190903-01112
2019-09-03 13:21:30,"Professional providers of financial advice should look carefully at the history of innovation since it can provide a proven and much needed roadmap for their future. Traditional financial services business models are under attack by new technologies, new approaches and new players forcing many incumbents into increasingly uncompetitive or irrelevant positions.

The industry has been historically structured around a series of strong linear disciplines (investment, insurance, taxes) where each has spent a lot of time and resources building moats against one another. 

The history of innovation successes that moved industries forward paints a different picture. It has always pointed to intersections and cross-discipline idea sharing and collaboration. New ideas and real progress happens when diverse perspectives, specializations and ideas intersect and this is where new knowledge, insights and solutions are generated.

To address an ongoing and accelerating rate of change in the industry, all financial providers need to bridge these moats of conflict, ego and distrust to creatively collaborate into client-centric teams. This is the best way to mix the latest of each disciplines’ thinking and solutions to keep ahead of rapid change and truly address clients’ increasingly complex family and business wealth needs.

The future of your firm may not be in enhancing and continuing the extrapolation of your current linear services but positioning your firm into a unique cross-discipline team approach.

To better understand this intersection and the power of industry collaboration as a strategic goal, we went to Institute member Travis Jennings, CEO of FinanceCAPE – A Tampa based financial concierge firm that has passionately been working to build strong networks of allied financial firms for the maximum benefit of clients.

Hortz:You explain what you and your services represent as being a Financial Concierge. What does that mean exactly? 

Jennings: The concept of being a “Financial Concierge” means being a genuine caretaker of the client in a 360-degree fashion. Anything and everything that may influence or impact their financial well-being is of concern to us. As a concierge, we are charged with the coordination, planning, and execution of how to manage the communication lines with their CPA, estate planning attorney, tax professional, insurance agent, banker, etc. Our goal is to create intersections of value through proactive planning with the additional professionals they rely on; to identify greater levels of opportunities and unseen challenges that can only be seen and resolved in co-ordination.

This is where our obligation and commitment as a fiduciary really shines. It’s one thing to have an excellent grasp on investments and wealth producing strategies; it’s another thing to manage the execution of those strategies which often require tools from other financial professionals to optimize investment results. The majority of clients we work with do not have the time or interest in facilitating these sorts of discussions. As a result, we quarterback the process for them to ensure the right questions are being asked and comprehensive strategies are being applied.

Hortz:What have you seen as client response or client experience to this approach?

Jennings: This approach brings freedom to the client: freedom of time, freedom of worry, and, most importantly, freedom from distrust. We are contending with a long-standing reputation our industry has cultivated of being transactional - “in and out” when it comes to client interaction. When you are targeting what is truly “best” for the client, you can demonstrate that by sticking around to bridge the gaps and have transparent discussions with other financial professionals who have a vested interest in your clients’ lives. This creates an enormous amount of trust with your client. The goal is to provide as much value to our client. To be the light that guides their path through a seemingly dark forest that has become the unfortunate norm within the industry.

Hortz:How does having a concierge approach really differentiate you and the services you provide?

Jennings: Being able to empathize with clients while also coordinating efforts with other financial professionals is as much an art as it is a science. This task is not for the faint of heart. Often, we contend with challenging personality types, individuals who are strictly transactional or are not interested in having proactive discussions on how to best serve the client. Our multifaceted approach allows us to create a one-stop solution that saves the client time and worry while uncovering additional opportunities that come from relationship optimization with fellow financial professionals. It uniquely positions us in the crossroads or intersections of all their financial specialists and needs.

Hortz:Tell us more about this intersection.

Jennings: Creating these intersections of value is what makes the concierge model work. The old saying of “many hands make for light work” rings true when a little bit of sweat equity and due diligence is applied to the overall relationship. When we establish long-term and short-term goals with our clients we recognize the limitless possibilities that exist through proactive planning and relationship management with other financial professionals. We admit that we DO NOT have all of the answers. We carry a keen expertise when it comes to wealth management, as well as tax solutions, but understand that we are not CPA’s, attorneys, or bankers. Each one of these professionals provides a different angle with points of consideration that effect our clients’ overall well-being. As caretakers, we welcome and rely on each expertise that allows us to serve the client in a 360 degree fashion.

Hortz:What do you see as your role at this intersection? 

Jennings: We facilitate the intersection. The effort it takes to connect the dots is no easy task as there often are barriers to entry with each professional. Whether it is time, personalities or distance, facilitating these conversations to create the working or engaged intersections has taken many years to perfect. By bringing everyone together, by helping make things happen, working together as equals to search for solutions for our clients – then magic can happen at this intersection of experts. The key is in the commitment each of us has to serve to our clients. In putting their needs, goals, and considerations first, we find common ground that we synergistically build upon and create value together.

Hortz:What have been your experiences working with other financial professionals in this potential intersection point?

Jennings: The beginning of any new professional relationship can present challenges as you are figuring each other out. Once other professionals recognize that we are facilitating positive opportunities for our mutual clients, seeking to save them time and increase their value, the relationship typically takes off. The beautiful thing about always doing the right thing for your client is that it equates to value compounding itself over time. This leads to greater trust with all parties involved in addition to a more than happy client who is truly getting the best of the best

Hortz:What are your best recommendations for advisors based from your experiences?

Jennings: Always put yourself in your client’s shoes and ask yourself how you would want an advisor to treat you. As primary as that sounds, it is a constant reminder and has been the backbone to how I built my firm. I always want my advisor to go the extra mile, be transparent and be proactive. The proactive part doesn’t stop at a financial plan that canvases the next 30 years of a client’s projected financial wellness. It requires additional conversations with other trusted professionals. It requires you easing the burden and stress for your client so they can see and feel, on an ongoing basis, how much you care as opposed to just hearing it during quarterly reviews.

 My best recommendation is to assume a leadership role in your client’s life. It’s where you make the proactive effort to bridge the gap and identify value opportunities with other trusted advisors in their life. Our duty and responsibility as a “concierge” is rooted in action and investing the time it takes to forge trust and this vibrant, coordinated intersection of financial services for our clients.

2019-09-03 08:59:00," Leverage is an investment strategy adopted by corporations wherein borrowed capital is used to expand operations and amplify possible returns from risk capital. Per the theory of cost of capital, a company's capital structure reflects a mix of debt and equity that is used to finance capital projects. Now a comparative analysis of the theory of cost of capital reveals that most companies prefer debt financing over equity since debt is cheaper, especially in periods of low interest rates. This is because when a company resorts to debt financing, it takes on fixed expenses in the form of interest payments for a specific time period. However, in case of equity financing, a shareholder not only becomes a partial owner of the company but develops a direct claim on the company's future profits as well. So, debt financing remains the preferred option for corporates. However, debt financing has its share of drawbacks. The problem arises when leverage, referred to as the amount of debt a company bears, becomes exorbitant. A high degree of financial leverage means high interest payments, which affect a company's bottom line. Therefore, choosing a less debt-ridden stock should be an appropriate option for a risk-averse investor.  And here comes the importance of leverage ratios, which can measure the exact amount of debt risk a company bears. Debt-to-equity ratio is one such measure, perhaps the most popular one, to evaluate a company's creditworthiness for potential equity investments.  Analyzing Debt/Equity  Debt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders' Equity This metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A company with a lower debt-to-equity ratio shows improved solvency for a company. Investors must be looking for stocks exhibiting solid earnings growth in the last couple of quarters. However, blindly investing in stocks displaying solid earnings growth, without considering their debt level, is not a wise move.  The Winning Strategy  Considering the aforementioned factors, it is prudent to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure steady returns. However, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome.

2019-09-03 14:00:00,"Sept 3 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc  is opening up its face recognition technology to all users with an option to opt out, the social media company said on Tuesday, as it discontinued a related feature called ""Tag Suggestions.""

The old feature enabled users to choose whether Facebook could suggest that their friends tag them in photos, without giving them control over other uses of the technology.

The face recognition setting, available to some Facebook users since December 2017, has additional functions such as notifying account holders if their profile photo is used by someone else.

Facebook's face recognition technology has been at the center of a privacy related lawsuit since 2015.

The lawsuit by Illinois users accused the company of violating the state's Biometric Information Privacy Act, claiming it illegally collected and stored biometric data of millions of users without their consent.

Last month, a federal appeals court rejected Facebook's effort to undo the class action status of the lawsuit. 

""We have always disclosed our use of face recognition technology and that people can turn it on or off at any time,"" Facebook said last month.

The company said it continues to engage with privacy experts, academics, regulators and its users on face recognition and its control options.","Facebook brings face recognition to all users, discontinues 'Tag Suggestions' - Nasdaq.com",https://www.nasdaq.com/article/facebook-brings-face-recognition-to-all-users-discontinues-tag-suggestions-20190903-00988
2019-09-03 06:49:00,"The Zacks Steel Producers industry consists of producers of a wide range of steel products for a number of end-use industries including automotive, construction, appliance, container, industrial machinery, transportation, and oil and gas. These products include hot-rolled and cold-rolled coils and sheets, hot-dipped and galvanized coils and sheets, reinforcing bars, billets, wire rods, strip mill plates, standard and line pipe, and mechanical tubing products.

Here are the industry's three major themes:

Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dim Prospects

The Zacks Steel Producers industry is part of the broader Zacks Basic Materials sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #172, which places it at the bottom 33% of more than 250 Zacks industries.
 The group's Zacks Industry Rank , which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates a gloomy near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.
 The industry's position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are pessimistic about this group's earnings growth potential. Over the past year, the industry's earnings estimate for the current year has gone down 61.1%.
 Before we present a few steel producers stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock market performance and current valuation.Industry Lags S&P 500 & Sector
 The Zacks Steel Producers industry has lagged both the Zacks S&P 500 composite and the broader Zacks Basic Materials Sector over the past year.
 The industry has declined 36.5% over this period compared with the S&P 500's decline of 0.5% and broader sector's decline of 16.2%.One-Year Price Performance

Industry's Current Valuation
 On the basis of trailing 12-month enterprise value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) ratio, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing steel stocks, the industry is currently trading at 5.65X, below the S&P 500's 10.89X and the sector's 8.68X.
 Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 9.56X, as low as 5.15X and at the median of 7.60X, as the chart below shows.Enterprise Value/EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) Ratio

Enterprise Value/EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) Ratio

Bottom Line
 The steel producers industry remains hamstrung by sustained overcapacity, driven by continued growth in Chinese production. Sino-U.S. trade tensions also pose as headwinds to the industry. A weakening Chinese economy amid trade war has triggered a slowdown in steel demand in China. Falling U.S. steel prices are also hurting American steel producers.
 Here, we present one stock sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and two stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) that are well positioned to gain amid the prevailing challenges. There is also another stock with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) that investors may currently hold on to. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .L.B.

2019-09-03 11:40:19,"Investors in United Airlines Holdings Inc (Symbol: UAL) saw new options become available today, for the October 11th expiration. At Stock Options Channel  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the UAL options chain for the new October 11th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.    The put contract at the $81.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.35. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $81.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $78.65 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of UAL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $82.36/share today. Because the $81.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.90% return on the cash commitment, or 27.87% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost  .  makeArticleAd();  Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for United Airlines Holdings Inc, and highlighting in green where the $81.00 strike is located relative to that history:       Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $83.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.76. If an investor was to purchase shares of UAL stock at the current price level of $82.36/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $83.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.13% if the stock gets called away at the October 11th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if UAL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for United Airlines Holdings Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing UAL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $83.00 strike highlighted in red:    Considering the fact that the $83.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 51%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.35% boost of extra return to the investor, or 32.19% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost  .    The implied volatility in the put contract example is 30%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 29%.    Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $82.36) to be 27%.

LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Trading government bonds or currencies using information gleaned from unpublished polls could breach market abuse rules, Britain'sFinancial Conduct Authority (FCA) said on Tuesday.

The FCA was responding to lawmaker concerns that during the Brexit vote in 2016, polling companies provided broadcasters with surveys while at the same time selling data privately to hedge funds which could then trade on the information.

Clarity has become more pressing as the next national election is potentially as soon as next month, sending polling firms into top gear.

""We encourage firms, where appropriate, to take legal advice on specific questions and actions which should be applied on a case-by-case basis,"" the FCA said in a statement on Tuesday.

""It is important to note that all firms and individuals, regardless of whether they carry out regulated financial services activities, fall in scope of our regulatory remit on market abuse.""

The concern among UK lawmakers prompted FCA Chief Executive Andrew Bailey to meet with polling industry officials to see how the watchdog's regulatory remit could interact with polling.

The FCA said in its formal response on Tuesday that it would be a breach of rules if an established polling firm shared bond market-moving information pre-publication, other than in the ""normal exercise of employment, a profession or duties"".

""It could also be an offence for anyone in possession of the information to trade in the relevant government bonds in advance of publication of the polling results if it is trading on the basis of the anticipated bond price movement that will result from publication of the results,"" the FCA said.

Trading in spot foreign exchange is not covered by the insider dealing provisions of market abuse rules, but other FCA rules would apply, the watchdog said.

The British Polling Council, an industry body, last year rejected lawmaker accusations of conflicts of interest in the sector.",UK watchdog warns polling firms ahead of possible Brexit election - Nasdaq.com,https://www.nasdaq.com/article/uk-watchdog-warns-polling-firms-ahead-of-possible-brexit-election-20190903-00449
2019-09-03 08:30:17,"A Norwegian savings bank dating back to the mid-1800s has just   invested in a cryptocurrency exchange set up by local business   magnate Bjørn Kjos.

In a   press   release    posted on the Oslo Stock Exchange, Sparebanken Øst said it   had taken a 16.3 percent stake in Norwegian Block   Exchange (NBX) for 15 million Norwegian krone (around $1.638   million).

NBX was   revealed     to be in development in April of last year, after being   founded by Kjos and his family. Bjorn's son Lars Ola Kjos -   apparently a   fan of   bitcoin    - is leading the exchange's operations. The platform   launched    for limited user testing in mid-August.

With Bjorn the founder and former CEO of Norwegian Air   Shuttle, the top Scandinavian airline is   expected    to tie up with NBX to offer cryptocurrency payments for flight   tickets.

In its investment announcement, Sparebanken Øst said:

""Possible collaboration with the airline Norwegian Air     Shuttle, a key player with NBX, could be a platform for     launching new solutions on a mass scale, and the bank sees     great market potential both nationally and     internationally.""

The bank added that, in backing in NBX, the exchange ""will   offer solutions that will equip the bank to manage competition   and future-oriented solutions for its customers.""

2019-09-03 07:02:00," Cancer has become a major health scare in the 21st century, with nearly every individual knowing someone or the other who has been affected. This life-threatening disease has attracted many big companies to invest in and develop solutions. Majority of the drug makers in the world are spending millions on developing treatment for oncology patients, with focus on the prevention, diagnosis and treatment. With still a diverse area left to explore and companies trying desperately to ""lead the market"" with its unique cancer-drug composition, investors can select stocks to gain attractive returns.  Cancer > 100 and Still Counting  Cancer in layman's term is a disease that is caused by the uncontrolled division of cells in the body. Doctors and researchers across the world have so far found more than 100 diseases, which can be collectively called cancer. The vast cancer-fighting industry has been broken down into several categories pre, in and post-cancer treatment. Companies that focus on prevention of cancer produce cessation products, for example smoking cessation products to reduce the risk of developing lung cancer. Others focus on diagnostics that involve analyzing and identification through tissue biopsies to determine the presence of cancerous cells.  The treatment of cancer remains the primary focus, whether it is invasive and non-invasive surgeries or chemotherapies. Some cancer patients need personalized medicines caused by mutation in DNA from the cancer cells. Developing a generic medicine for cancer has a lot of grey area to cover and decades of research work still waits.  Why Invest in Cancer-Fighting Stocks?  In 2018, IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science reported around $150 billion was spent on medicines to treat cancer and this would rise to $250 billion in 2023. The investment in cancer-fighting stocks attracts investors with the potential to generate higher returns over the long term and beat the market. So far this year, the biotech sector has seen a boom boosted by new drug discovery, approval of patents and most importantly, mega-mergers. The S&P Biotechnology Select Industry Index is up by 12% on a year-to-date basis and is still growing. The biotech space took a flight in January 2019 with the announcement of the merger of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company BMY  and Celgene Corporation CELG  , two leading oncological drug makers. Bristol-Myers Squibb has offered to acquire Celgene for $74 billion.  5 Stocks to Buy Now  With the growing rate of cancer patients every year, cancer-fighting stocks seem to be gaining immensely.

2019-09-03 11:37:54,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

If investors are searching for market-weighted leadership off and on the price chart, look no further than Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ). If you also want above-average returns with less risk, these two MSFT stock strategies make going long all the more compelling. Let me explain.

Despite August's market volatility and mostly pressured price action, it continues to be a standout year for MSFT stock. Relative to the S&P 500's own burly gain of 16%, shares of Microsoft are up an impressive 36%.

This return differential amounts to more than a double. What's more, while the S&P 500 dropped 1.7% this past month - as much as 4.5% at its worst - and gave up key price supports on the price chart, shares of MSFT continued to demonstrate their durability as a market standout.

At its weakest, MSFT pulled back less than 3%. Critical trend-line supports remain intact and for the month, shares finished up 1.45%. The price performance has also allowed Microsoft stock to retain the top spot as the world's largest publicly traded company and keep its market capitalization in excess of $1 trillion.

Microsoft's tenacity isn't without merit either. Microsoft's most recent earnings topper in late July backs that positive view. Right now MSFT's leadership is also unmatched among mega-cap stocks. Wall Street's former and long-standing crown jewel Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and brief top dog Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN )  both finished underwater in August. Similar to the broader market, both stocks undermined their bullish price trends to varying degrees.

Blame it on what you will, but MSFT stock continues to look like the stronger all-around investment. Taking a visual inspection of MSFT's technical wherewithal proves this.

Since clearing its Dot.com all-time-high of $60 in late 2016, MSFT has put together a constructive bull run which has yielded about 125% for shareholders. The rally also continues to demonstrate healthy pattern characteristics. Market leadership strongly suggests that Microsoft shares are headed even higher.

Currently MSFT stock is in the process of building a weekly chart base-on-base formation. The sturdy pattern of nearly three months has successfully tested an existing uptrend and lateral price support. That's bullish compared to the broader market's performance last month. Now, and with Microsoft shares on the cusp of  a stochastics crossover and the market stealthily putting together a bullish follow-through day signal on Aug. 13, all the elements for a successful breakout are in place.

One suggested trend approach for entering Microsoft is to position as shares rally through the base-on-base formation high of $141.20. That's roughly 2.5% above the current MSFT stock price. Should a breakout occur, I'd set an initial target for taking partial profits near $165.

The 17% premium relative to the pattern and all-time-high looks justified given MSFT's resiliency. And in anticipation, today's durable platform will lead to a price gain similar to the December to April leg within Microsoft's price trend.

To keep long exposure looking smart off and on the price chart I'd recommend an initial stop-loss beneath $133. This amounts to risk of just under 6% and gives sufficient technical leeway without waiting for a full-fledged failure of the base breakout.

Alternatively, for intermediate-term investors looking to make MSFT stock a core holding, an adjustable collar position is an attractive way to position.

This flexible strategy limits and reduces risk, can allow investors to accumulate shares more safely and captures upside profits if Microsoft continues to rally. One favored collar is the November $150 call/$130 put combination for $139.50 with shares trading at $137.86.

2019-09-03 09:16:31,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

The stock market dodged a bullet in August. It may not be quite so lucky in September.

Let me explain…

For the month of August, the S&P 500 lost almost 2%. That's not good. But, it's nowhere near as bad as it looked a week ago, and nowhere near as bad as it could have been. If the market had broken to the downside of its recent trading range - which it looked close to doing so last week - the target for the S&P 500 would have been around 2750.

That's not a disaster. It's a drop of only about 9% from the all-time high reached in July. It would have been painful, for sure. But most folks could probably handle it.

What is much more difficult to handle would have been the bearish setup that sort of move would have created on the long-term chart.

Take a look at this monthly chart of the S&P 500 plotted along with its 20-month  exponential moving average (EMA) …

Longtime readers know I use this chart to determine the long-term trend of the broad stock market. If the S&P 500 is trading above its 20-month EMA, then we're in a bull market. If the index is below the line, then the bear is in charge.

If the S&P 500 had declined to the lower target of about 2750, then it would have closed the month of August below its 20-month EMA. And that would have called into question the viability of the long-term bull market.

So, like I said… the market dodged a bullet.

But it's still in the battle zone. It won't take much of a decline in September to shift the longer-term trend to bearish. And, with the significant negative divergence on momentum indicators like the  MACD  and  RSI , the next decline phase could be a BIG one.

For now, though, we can all breathe a collective sigh of relief. The market didn't fall apart in August. And  the short-term pattern looks more bullish than bearish . But, traders should keep a watchful eye on this long-term chart of the S&P as we get through September. It could be setting us up for a scary October.

Best regards and good trading,

2019-09-03 13:02:00,"Sept 3 (Reuters) - Walmart Inc  said on Tuesday it would discontinue sales of some ammunition in stores across the United States, in response to the mass shootings in Texas last month that killed several people.

The largest U.S. arms retailer also said it would discontinue handgun sales in Alaska, the only state where it sells these guns.

Walmart will stop selling short-barrel rifle ammunition such as the .223 caliber and 5.56 caliber after clearing current stock. While this type of ammunition is commonly used in some hunting rifles, they are also used in large capacity clips on military-style weapons, the company said.

The retailer, which has been under pressure to change its policies on gun sales, said it took the action following the death of 31 people in mass shootings in Texas and Ohio, one of which took place in a Walmart store.

Just last month, Walmart asked employees at its U.S. stores to take down signs and playable demos of violent video games, but made no changes to its policy on selling firearms.

""As a company, we experienced two horrific events in one week, and we will never be the same,"" Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said in a letter to Walmart's associates.

The retailer, however, said it would continue to cater to hunting and sport shooting enthusiasts, selling long barrel deer rifles and shotguns.

The company added that its latest actions would reduce its market share of ammunition from around 20% to a range of about 6% to 9%.

""We believe it will likely drift toward the lower end of that range, over time, given the combination of these changes,"" McMillon said.",Walmart to stop selling short-barrel rifle ammunition - Nasdaq.com,https://www.nasdaq.com/article/walmart-to-stop-selling-shortbarrel-rifle-ammunition-20190903-00956

SKX  , Rent-A-Center, Inc. RCII  , Crocs, Inc. CROX  , Lincoln Educational Services Corp. LINC  and Funko, Inc. FNKO  .  Here are highlights from Friday's Analyst Blog:    Consumer Spending Fuels Q2 GDP: Top Picks   Last month, the Department of Commerce's initial estimate for second-quarter GDP pushed the economy's most widely watched metric below the level recorded for the first quarter. Now, the latest estimate for the gauge has moved even lower, as was widely expected. Economists are attributing the slide to the fallout of the bitter U.S.-China trade war. The petering out of the impact of Trump's tax cuts is believed to be another reason for this significant decline in growth. However, GDP still surpassed some estimates, only due to the contribution from strong consumer spending. This is why it still makes good sense to invest in consumer discretionary stocks, which derive strength from personal spending, universally acknowledged as the engine of the U.S. economy.  Trade War, Receding Impact of Tax Cuts Hurt GDP  Per the Commerce Department's second estimate, GDP for the second quarter currently stands at an annualized rate of 2%. This is marginally lower than the pace of 2.1% estimated last month. It represents an even more significant slowdown from the 3.1% pace recorded in the first quarter. The economy expanded 2.6% during the first half of 2019. Economists attribute this deceleration to the U.S.-China trade war. The conflict shows no sign of ending and has reduced business investment and hurt manufacturing. It now threatens to end the 11-year long economic expansion. Another reason for the loss in economic momentum is the receding impact of Trump's tax cut and government spending drive.   Consumer Spending to the Rescue  Though the Fed Chair thinks that the economy is favorably positioned, the central bank is closely observing events. Jerome Powell has stated time and again that the Federal Reserve will ""act as appropriate"" to sustain the pace of economic momentum. Last month's rate cut supports such a view and markets have already penciled in another reduction in rates after the Fed's September meeting. At this point, the only saving grace for the economy is the robust pace of consumer spending. The Department of Commerce raised its estimate for growth in consumer spending from 4.3% to 4.7% for the second quarter. The metric, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, benefited from higher spending overall, especially on autos, apparel and restaurants.  Strong consumer spending also helped American businesses rack up their first increase in profits in three quarters. The 5.3% rise in adjusted pretax corporate profits was also the first since mid-2014. Higher spending also contributed to a decline in inventory accumulation during the second quarter.  Our Choices  Despite the slowdown in economic growth, the U.S. economy remains in a strong position thanks to a solid burst of consumer spending. With American consumers remaining confident, the trend is likely to be sustained in the quarters ahead. This is why investing in consumer discretionary stocks remains a prudent choice. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult. This is where our VGM Score  comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.

The petering out of the impact of Trump's tax cuts is believed to be another reason for this significant decline in growth. However, GDP still surpassed some estimates, only due to the contribution from strong consumer spending.

This is why it still makes good sense to invest in consumer discretionary stocks, which derive strength from personal spending, universally acknowledged as the engine of the U.S. economy.

 Trade War, Receding Impact of Tax Cuts Hurt GDP 

Per the Commerce Department's second estimate, GDP for the second quarter currently stands at an annualized rate of 2%. This is marginally lower than the pace of 2.1% estimated last month. It represents an even more significant slowdown from the 3.1% pace recorded in the first quarter. The economy expanded 2.6% during the first half of 2019.

Economists attribute this deceleration to the U.S.-China trade war. The conflict shows no sign of ending and has reduced business investment and hurt manufacturing. It now threatens to end the 11-year long economic expansion. Another reason for the loss in economic momentum is the receding impact of Trump's tax cut and government spending drive. 

 Consumer Spending to the Rescue 

Though the Fed Chair thinks that the economy is favorably positioned, the central bank is closely observing events. Jerome Powell has stated time and again that the Federal Reserve will ""act as appropriate"" to sustain the pace of economic momentum. Last month's rate cut supports such a view and markets have already penciled in another reduction in rates after the Fed's September meeting.

At this point, the only saving grace for the economy is the robust pace of consumer spending. The Department of Commerce raised its estimate for growth in consumer spending from 4.3% to 4.7% for the second quarter. The metric, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, benefited from higher spending overall, especially on autos, apparel and restaurants. 

Strong consumer spending also helped American businesses rack up their first increase in profits in three quarters. The 5.3% rise in adjusted pretax corporate profits was also the first since mid-2014. Higher spending also contributed to a decline in inventory accumulation during the second quarter.

 Our Choices 

Despite the slowdown in economic growth, the U.S. economy remains in a strong position thanks to a solid burst of consumer spending. With American consumers remaining confident, the trend is likely to be sustained in the quarters ahead.

This is why investing in consumer discretionary stocks remains a prudent choice. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.

This is where our VGM Score  comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners.

2019-09-03 15:00:00,"MELBOURNE, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Several BHP Group shareholders, including the Church of England pension fund, are recommending the company suspend its membership in industry groups that advocate for policies inconsistent with the Paris climate change agreement.

The resolution was filed on Tuesday by the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR) ahead of BHP's ,  annual general meetings (AGM) in London and Sydney, the ACCR said in a statement.

Co-filers included the Church of England Pensions Board and Grok Ventures, the private investment vehicle of Australian tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes, as well as institutional investors that combined hold A$140 billion( $94.6 billion) under management.

""ACCR has met with BHP on multiple occasions, and we have given them a long list of examples of adverse climate lobbying by their industry associations,"" it said.

BHP Chief Executive Officer Andrew Mackenzie said in July that the world's biggest miner would invest $400 million over five years to reduce emissions, as it also became the first miner to pledge to tackle pollution caused when customers use its products. 

ACCR said that the inconsistency between BHP's climate-aware positioning and ""the oppositional advocacy of its industry associations is especially acute in Australia."" Australia is the world's biggest coal exporter.

Industry groups like Minerals Council of Australia have repeatedly called for coal friendly policies, including government subsidies for coal-fired power stations and the development of a new thermal coal basin in Queensland, the ACCR said.

To meet carbon targets in the Paris accord, Western countries must stop burning coal for power by 2030, experts have said.

The ACCR lodged a similar resolution in 2017 that saw BHP review its membership of more than twenty industry associations and quit the World Coal Association.

At the time, BHP pledged to review its membership in any groups that advocated for ""material"" differences in policy positions to its own that could impact public policy and where it did not otherwise see sufficient membership benefit.

BHP has said that it can accomplish more with industry groups by being members but that it would keep its membership of groups and their policy positions under review.

BHP's upcoming London AGM is on Oct. 17 while its Sydney AGM is Nov. 7.

2019-09-03 16:28:35,"The DividendRank  formula at Dividend Channel  ranks a coverage universe of thousands of  dividend stocks  , according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics - strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive. Patterson Companies Inc (Symbol: PDCO) presently has an above average rank, in the top 50% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most ""interesting"" ideas that merit further research by investors.    But making Patterson Companies Inc an even more interesting and timely stock to look at, is the fact that in trading on Tuesday, shares of PDCO entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $15.98 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30. In the case of Patterson Companies Inc, the RSI reading has hit 29.9 - by comparison, the universe of dividend stocks covered by Dividend Channel  currently has an average RSI of 47.2. A falling stock price - all else being equal - creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield. Indeed, PDCO's recent annualized dividend of 1.04/share (currently paid in quarterly installments) works out to an annual yield of 6.22% based upon the recent $16.72 share price.    A bullish investor could look at PDCO's 29.9 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. Among the fundamental datapoints dividend investors should investigate to decide if they are bullish on PDCO is its dividend history.

2019-09-03 10:06:00,"By Ana Mano

SAO PAULO, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Burger King will launch a plant-based burger imitating meat called the ""Rebel Whopper"" in Brazil in November, the company said on Tuesday, amid an international rush for mass-market chains to cater to vegetarian and vegan diners.

Burger King will sell the vegetarian burgers developed by meatpacker Marfrig Global Foods SA  for 29.90 reais ($7.26) in Brazil, representatives of the two companies said at a press briefing in Sao Paulo.

The launch of plant-based products comes amid heightened consumer concerns over health, the environment and even animal welfare, forcing companies to adapt to consumers wanting to eat less meat.

The trend has given rise to non-meat start-ups like Beyond Meat Inc  and Impossible Foods Inc in the United States, with Brazil-based traditional meat-packers like Marfrig and JBS SA  following suit.

Burger King, owned by Brazilian-controlled 3G Capital via its majority stake in Restaurant Brands International , will launch the burger in Sao Paulo city on Sept. 10, expanding to Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states in October, and elsewhere in November.

The chain found in a survey that 69% of Brazilian consumers were likely to buy a plant-based burger if offered at Burger King, ranking first ahead of China with 41%, the company's Brazil CEO Iuri Miranda said.

He estimated Brazil's fast food market is worth 400 billion reais ($97 billion).

In the United States, Impossible Foods supplies the plant-based burgers sold in Burger King stores, while Marfrig will be the chain's exclusive supplier in Brazil.

Executives at Burger King and Marfrig declined to comment on details or duration of that contract.

Marfrig's chief executive for South America, Miguel Gularte, said the company is developing other plant-based products which may be sold in supermarkets, but they will not use the same recipes as the Burger King burgers.

2019-09-03 09:32:00,"Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust (NYSE: PEI) or PREIT, has been hit particularly hard by the wave of retail bankruptcies commonly referred to as the retail apocalypse . It's a shopping mall operator with ownership interests in properties across the United States, and significant exposure to chains including SearsHoldings , Macy's , and J.C. Penney . As such, it's had to use creative means to adjust for the current retail reality.

Shareholders may have caught a lucky break. Back in 2012, a new management team took control and had the foresight to divest its lower-value mall assets. The idea was to focus on properties with higher sales per square foot, which are more attractive to retailers and can garner better rental rates.

When this divestment process started in 2013, PREIT managed 38 malls with average sales per square foot of $379. After years of selling properties, the company now manages 21 properties with average sales per square foot of $525.

It still lists three malls as ""noncore"" and could also sell these assets in part or whole. It owns the Valley View Mall and the Wyoming Valley Mall in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, which both have significant vacancies that it has been unable to fill, and the Exton Square Mall in Exton, Pennsylvania, where it was able to sell a land parcel to be developed into an apartment complex. Given the poor state of these three malls, it is also possible that they will just be written off or abandoned entirely.

Pennsylvania REIT has actively managed its portfolio to adjust to where it sees the most value accruing. Shareholders should continue to expect the company to monetize its assets through a sale where it can.

Image source: Getty Images.

Industrywide disruption at retailers has led to a number of bankruptcies from department stores and niche chains. Other retailers such as Macy's and Chico's  have also pulled back by closing stores.

To replace its lost tenants, PREIT has redeveloped much of what formerly was occupied by department stores into gyms, movie theaters, grocery stores, and smaller retail spaces. Over the past few years, the company has successfully repositioned 13 former department stores with over 25 new occupants.

Examples of redeveloped stores include turning a former JCPenny into a movie theater complex at the Willow Grove Park complex in Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, and turning a former Sears into three new stores at the Moorestown Mall in Moorestown, N.J.

But such redevelopment requires capital investment; the JC Penny project at Willow Grove Park cost the company approximately $28 million, while redeveloping the Sears at Moorestown Mall cost $29 million.

Cash isn't plentiful for PREIT. The company has had to borrow aggressively to fund its redevelopment activity in addition to selling its noncore malls, and it is betting that it will be able to generate an attractive rate of return on these new developments. Many projects are still underway, so it is too early to judge if the strategy will bear fruit.

Densification is yet another tool for shopping mall operators to maximize the value of their assets. It refers to a shopping mall redeveloping some of its real estate into other types of property, including residential apartments, hotels, or offices.

Those who have been paying attention to the REIT section are probably aware of the significant push that mall operators includingSimon Property Group  have made into densification. These projects generally involve partnering with a specialized developer or just selling the land to another real estate company in order to get a project done and monetize some real estate value.

In the case of PREIT, the company has used joint ventures or sold land to redevelop for nonretail purposes.

PREIT has a 50/50 joint venture with fellow shopping center REIT Macerich  to redevelop a mall in downtown Philadelphia formerly known as The Gallery into the Fashion District Philadephia. It is adjacent to a convention center and popular tourist attractions and will contain various entertainment facilities in addition to a shopping mall. PREIT has also sold land at its Exton Square Mall to a developer to build apartments.

The company has more densification plans and expects to yield as much as $300 million in potential asset sales as part of these projects.

Image source: Getty Images.

It is not in an enviable position. The company has seen its occupancy rate decline and has had to pony up to invest in redeveloping several former anchor spaces. This has put pressure on cash flows, which have also declined, and on its balance sheet, which has seen leverage increase.

Although the company has attracted new tenants with its redevelopment efforts, the driving factor of success will be shoppers coming back to once-vacant malls. Densification efforts are also interesting but still too early to judge.

Executing a turnaround won't be easy given the broader industry trends that the company is fighting. But PREIT has laid out a cogent plan to reposition itself for the future of retail, and it has a good shot at coming out the other end as a stronger company.

2019-09-03 16:20:00,"By Sinéad Carew

NEW YORK, Sept 3 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday as investors worried about global growth prospects after data showed U.S. factory activity shrank in August for the first time since 2016 and the United States and China imposed new tariffs on each other over the weekend.

Investors fled riskier assets as the latest round of tariffs and the lack of a date for a resumption of U.S.-China talks gnawed at any hopes for a resolution to the long-running trade war, which has rattled markets for months and weighed on world economies. 

""If anything the U.S. manufacturing data signals that the new tariffs couldn't come at a worse time. It's bad news on top of bad news. That's why investors are so focused on negotiations"" said Alec Young, managing director of global markets research at FTSE Russell based in New York.  

""Not only have expectations been receding for a U.S.-China deal but they can't even agree on a date to meet,"" said Young. 

He also cited growing uncertainty around Brexit as a concern for investors. British lawmakers on Tuesday triggered a vote that could allow them to stop Boris Johnson pursuing a ""no-deal"" Brexit, a challenge that the government warned would prompt the prime minister to seek an election on Oct. 14. 

Earlier in the day data showed British construction companies last month suffered the sharpest drop in new orders since the financial crisis amid Brexit jitters. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 285.26 points, or 1.08%, to 26,118.02, the S&P 500  lost 20.19 points, or 0.69%, to 2,906.27 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 88.72 points, or 1.11%, to 7,874.16.

Trade-sensitive industrials  fell 1.4%, making for the biggest percentage loser among the S&P 11 major sectors. Technology stocks  fell 1.3%, weighed down by chipmakers, which have a large revenue exposure to China. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index  dropped 1.8%.

Boeing Co shares , tumbled 2.7% providing the biggest drag for the Dow, after the Federal Aviation Administration said on Friday a global panel of experts will need a few more weeks to finish its review of the company's 737 MAX certification. 

U.S. casino operators felt the brunt of slowing economic growth in China as gambling hub Macau posted weak August casino revenue. Shares of Las Vegas Sands Corp , Wynn Resorts Ltd  and MGM Resorts International  fell between 2% and almost 4%. 

The only sectors that gained ground were utilities , rising 1.8%, real estate , climbing 1.3% and consumer staples , which closed the session up 0.5%. 

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.61-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.50-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 43 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 49 new highs and 134 new lows.  

On U.S. exchanges 6.72 billion shares changed hands compared with the 6.99 billion average for the last 20 sessions.","Wall St pushed down by weak data, trade worries - Nasdaq.com",https://www.nasdaq.com/article/wall-st-pushed-down-by-weak-data-trade-worries-20190903-01156
2019-09-03 07:22:00,"The energy industry can be highly volatile, but energy services companies like Baker Hughes, a GE Company (NYSE: BHGE) and Helmerich & Payne (NYSE: HP) are particularly susceptible to price swings. That's because they sell products and services to oil and natural gas drillers, which often pull back hard on spending when oil prices falter (a relatively frequent occurrence lately). What makes the comparison between Baker Hughes and Helmerich & Payne so interesting, however, has less to do with the oil industry and more to do with the companies themselves. Here's why one of this pair is a much better option than the other today.

Baker Hughes, a GE Company was formed in mid-2017, when GE merged its oil and gas businesses with Baker Hughes. That created a company that can provide products and services to the energy industry across the entire spectrum of the space, including the upstream (drilling), midstream (pipelines), and downstream (chemicals and refining) subsectors. The company actually refers to itself as the world's ""first and only fullstream provider.""

Image source: Getty Images.

It has a material business, with revenues of $6 billion in the second quarter. Notably, that figure was up 8% year over year. Orders of $6.6 billion were up 9% year over year, as well, suggesting that Baker Hughes is on a solid path. Which is great news, since the company has had a hard time staying in the black since the merger was completed. That's not exactly Baker Hughes' fault; spending in the oil industry has been touch and go because of volatile oil prices . However, profitability does play into the bigger picture here, just a little more indirectly.

That's because General Electric (NYSE: GE) is working through a difficult turnaround effort that hasn't been going particularly well . After the merger of GE's oil and gas business with Baker Hughes, the industrial giant ended up with a 62.5% stake in the combined entity. That's why GE is stuck on the end of Baker Hughes' name. GE has since reduced that stake to a little over 50%, which means it still has a controlling position in Baker Hughes. That stock sale, however, was made at what some believe to be a fire sale price, suggesting that GE was selling out of desperation . With Baker Hughes' shares down roughly 66% since a peak in late 2017, that analysis sounds pretty spot on.

The thing is, GE remains highly leveraged and appears to have a lot of work ahead before its turnaround starts producing material results. Which means that it could decide to sell more Baker Hughes shares to raise cash, if it needs it. Fear of such sales taking place will likely put a damper on Baker Hughes' stock until either there's more clarity at GE (like notably improving earnings) or the company actually sells the shares, which it has promised to do.

BHGE data by YCharts

Baker Hughes, a GE Company is a significant business and has a strong operating history behind it. But most investors should avoid the company until its relationship with GE gets much closer to ending. It will survive the energy industry's current malaise, even if it means bleeding red ink for a bit, but there's no end in sight to the complicated GE story. And that's a risk that's just not worth taking on right now for most investors.

When you compare that situation to Helmerich & Payne, the answer is pretty easy. Like Baker Hughes, Helmerich & Payne has been struggling to adjust to a fast-changing energy landscape. That's meant bottom-line losses. Overall, however, it has done a reasonably good job of dealing with a difficult market . Helmerich & Payne doesn't have the breadth of offerings that Baker Hughes does, but it is a leader in its drilling services niche and will at worst muddle through.

You can be doubly confident of that fact if you take a look at the company's balance sheet . Long-term debt makes up just 10% of Helmerich & Payne's capital structure, making it one of the least leveraged of its closest peers. Moreover, it has the leading market share position in the U.S. onshore space (which is where roughly 90% of its rigs are located), partly because it controls a large portfolio of the most desirable and technically advanced drilling rigs. That's not an accident. Helmerich & Payne has specifically focused on leading the industry in technology, and that's proven to be a successful approach over time. One of the best examples of the company's long-term success is its incredible 46-year history of annual dividend increases. None of its peers comes close to matching that. 

While it may take a strong stomach to buy Helmerich & Payne, given the out-of-favor sector in which it operates, it is one of the better-situated companies in the space. What makes the company a better pick than Baker Hughes, meanwhile, is that Helmerich & Payne is well positioned and it doesn't have a troubled third party in possession of more than half the company's shares. In other words, you can get exposure to an important energy services company without the added risk of a struggling GE.

Helmerich & Payne is the better option here because of the complicated relationship Baker Hughes has with GE. That's not a situation that is going to resolve itself quickly, and it's likely to be a material headwind to the stock until it does actually get resolved. That said, both companies have done a decent job of dealing with the oil industry's current volatility and, frankly, the ups and downs in the space over time, as well. But with a rock-solid balance sheet, leading position in its niche, and no third-party ownership complications, Helmerich & Payne just looks like a safer choice than Baker Hughes today.

LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The euro plunged to a 28-monthlow against the dollar on Tuesday as investors priced in deepernegative interest rates for longer in the euro zone.

The common currency's drop also came on the back of astrengthening dollar as the trade spat between Washington andBeijing intensified and traders turned to buying U.S. assets assafe-haven investments without hedging their dollar currencyexposure, analysts said. 

Money markets have increased to more than 80% theprobability that the European Central Bank will cut itsbenchmark rate by 20 basis points when it meets next week. 

 The ECB benchmark rate now stands at minus 0.40% and it has all but promised a monetary policy stimulus package as economicgrowth falters. Monday's PMI survey showed Europeanmanufacturing contracted for seven straightmonths. urn:newsml:reuters.com:*:nL5N25Q2T8urn:newsml:reuters.com:*:nL5N25Q32W

The euro EUR=EBS was last down by 0.3% at $1.0936. It fellto $1.0926 earlier, its lowest since mid-May 2017. A break belowthe key $1.1000 level last week had sparked heavier sell-offs.

Against an index of its six major rivals, the dollar .DXY rose to 99.37 on Tuesday, the highest since mid-May 2017, asinvestors became more gloomy about the global economy'sprospects amid the U.S.-China trade dispute.

Bloomberg News reported that Chinese and U.S. officials arestruggling to agree a schedule for a round of trade negotiationsthat had been expected this month.

Overseas investors dived into buying U.S. Treasuries,considered the most liquid and safe investment in tumultuoustimes. 

The 10-year Treasury bond yield fell 2.5 basis points to1.48% on Tuesday, close to the low of $1.44% it reached lastweek that was last seen in mid-2016.

The flows have boosted the dollar, but investors' decisionto either buy Treasuries unhedged, or trim some of theircurrency hedges has intensified the gains in the greenback, saidRichard Falkenhall, senior forex strategist at SEB. 

Higher government bonds in the United States compared withthe rest of the developed world makes it worthless to buy U.S.government bonds to overseas investors if they also buyprotection against unexpected swings in the U.S. currency.

""The dollar tends to outperform all other currencies exceptthe yen"" when the global economy slows down, said Falkenhall. 

""Everything is going in the same direction pointing to astronger dollar,"" he said.

EURO AND ITALY 

The euro could get some relief if the 5-Star Movement andthe Democratic Party form a coalition government in Italy,analysts said. 5-Star members will vote on Tuesday on forming acoalition with PD.

""If the vote succeeds, the euro could gain somewhat,"" MUFGanalysts said in a note, adding that ""Italian assets like bondsand stocks would likely rally somewhat further"". 

Elsewhere, the pound fell to its lowest in nearly threeyears on Tuesday as British lawmakers prepared to vote on thefirst stage of their plan to block Prime Minister Boris Johnsonfrom pursuing a no-deal Brexit. GBP/urn:newsml:reuters.com:*:nL5N25U0GW

2019-09-03 13:50:13,"In trading on Tuesday, shares of Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (Symbol: CLF) touched a new 52-week low of $6.81/share. That's a $6.29 share price drop, or -48.02% decline from the 52-week high of $13.10 set back on 09/26/2018. Large percentage drops always require that the stock post even larger percentage gains from the low in order to recover the old price point, and for CLF that means the stock would have to gain 92.36% to get back to the 52-week high. For a move like that, Cleveland-Cliffs Inc would need fundamental strength at the business level. Here's a rhetorical question: Who knows more about fundamentals at the business level than the company's own insiders? So let's take a look to see whether any company insiders were taking the other side of the trade as CLF shares were being sold down to this new 52-week low, focusing on the most recent trailing six month period. As summarized by the table below, CLF has seen 7 different instances of insiders buying over the past six months.     makeArticleAd();  In the short run, while the new 52-week low suggests the stock is at the cheapest price and perhaps therefore the best bargain it has been over the last 52 weeks, the low print also means anyone who has purchased the stock over that timeframe is staring at an unrealized loss. Oftentimes, that factor drives a stock's technical analysis metrics by creating overhead resistance, with investors who bought higher now anxious to reverse their trade once they are back to breakeven. The chart below shows where CLF has traded over the past year, with the 50-day and 200-day moving averages included.       Time will tell whether the insider purchases foretell a future rebound for CLF shares, which are presently showing a last trade of $6.86/share, slightly above the new 52-week low.

2019-09-03 08:40:00,"  Extra Space Storage Inc. EXR  has earned a solid recognition in the self-storage industry. The company has been putting in efforts for the expansion of its geographical footprint through accretive acquisitions and third-party management platforms. It enjoys solid presence in key cities and opts for strategic joint ventures to drive long-term profitability.  makeArticleAd();  Also, shares of Extra Space Storage have outperformed its industry  in three months' time. The company's shares have gained 13.8%, while the industry has rallied 5.9% during this time frame.       Currently, the trend in estimate revisions for 2019 funds from operations (FFO) per share indicates a favorable outlook for this self-storage REIT. In fact, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock is likely to rally further in the near term on a number of favorable factors, and the current price offers a good entry point.   Let's explore what makes it a solid choice:   Expansion Efforts  : Extra Space Storage has grown its branded store count from 820 in 2010 to 1,752 in second-quarter 2019. Also, total stores managed for third-party owners increased from 181 in 2012 to 595 in second-quarter 2019. Moreover, over the past five years, Extra Space Storage acquired $4.6 billion in properties. The company gained an increased scale in several core markets on the back of these acquisitions as well as fortified its presence in a number of new markets.    These efforts have helped this Salt Lake City, UT-based self-storage real estate investment trust (REIT) emerge as the second largest self-storage owner and/or operator and the largest self-storage management company in the United States. Majority of this REIT's stores are situated around large population centers which enjoy above-average population and income demographics for stores.    Furthermore, the industry is characterized by fragmented ownership, and only around 30% of the total self-storage square footage is under REIT's ownership. This creates solid scope for consolidation at some level in the future and with a solid balance sheet, Extra Space Storage is well poised to compete for acquisitions.   Healthy Asset Fundamentals  : The self-storage asset category is basically need-based and recession-resilient in nature. This asset class has low capital-expenditure requirements and generates high operating margins. Furthermore, the self-storage industry continues to witness solid demand, backed by favorable demographic changes. Specifically, the downsizing trend, an encouraging labor market, increase in the number of people renting homes have escalated the needs of consumers to rent space at a storage facility to park their possessions. In addition, self-storage assets are benefiting from adoption of technology, and serving the millennial generation.   Balance-Sheet Strength and High ROE  : Extra Space Storage remains focused on improving its balance sheet. The company exited the June-end quarter with roughly $47.7 million of cash and cash equivalents. Moreover, as of Jun 30, 2019, Extra Space Storage had $399.9 million available for issuance under its ATM equity program. Over the years, the company has increased the size of its unencumbered asset pool. Also, it has staggered its maturities. Further, Extra Space Storage's Return on Equity (ROE) is 16.71% compared with the industry's average of 5.06%. This reflects that the company reinvests more efficiently compared to the industry.   Dividend Payouts  : Solid dividend payouts remain arguably the biggest attraction for REIT investors and Extra Space Storage remains committed to this purpose. This May, the company announced a 4.7% hike in its quarterly dividend payout. The company has achieved a five-year total increase of 91.5% in dividend. Such shareholder-friendly efforts are encouraging.   Other Key Picks    Investors can also consider other top-ranked stocks in the REIT space like Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.

In addition, self-storage assets are benefiting from adoption of technology, and serving the millennial generation.   Balance-Sheet Strength and High ROE  : Extra Space Storage remains focused on improving its balance sheet. The company exited the June-end quarter with roughly $47.7 million of cash and cash equivalents. Moreover, as of Jun 30, 2019, Extra Space Storage had $399.9 million available for issuance under its ATM equity program. Over the years, the company has increased the size of its unencumbered asset pool. Also, it has staggered its maturities. Further, Extra Space Storage's Return on Equity (ROE) is 16.71% compared with the industry's average of 5.06%. This reflects that the company reinvests more efficiently compared to the industry.   Dividend Payouts  : Solid dividend payouts remain arguably the biggest attraction for REIT investors and Extra Space Storage remains committed to this purpose. This May, the company announced a 4.7% hike in its quarterly dividend payout. The company has achieved a five-year total increase of 91.5% in dividend. Such shareholder-friendly efforts are encouraging.   Other Key Picks    Investors can also consider other top-ranked stocks in the REIT space like Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.

Sept 3 (Reuters) - U.S. oil and gas producer Concho Resources Inc  said on Tuesday it would sell a portion of its New Mexico assets for $925 million to KKR-backed Spur Energy Partners LLC and plans to use the money to lower its debt and buyback shares.

The deal is the latest in the sector as oil and gas producers have been divesting non-core assets amid investor pressure to shore up their cash reserves for buybacks and dividends.

The company, the top oil producer in New Mexico, also said in a post earnings conference call in August that it did not plan to allocate capital to the assets for the next five years.

MUFG Securities Americas analyst Michael McAllister said while the sale isn't a ""game changer"" for Concho, it was a good deal as the company wasn't going to put much money into its New Mexico assets for a few years.

The assets, a narrow strip of about 100,000 gross acres bordering Concho's operations in the Delaware basin, produce about 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), the company said in a statement.

Analysts at Capital One Securities said the offer price was ""solid"", adding that such non-core property sales would help the lower the company's cash operating expense, currently at $9.83 per barrel of oil equivalent.

The proceeds from the deal will be used to pay down debt and initiate the share repurchase program of up to $1.5 billion, the company said. 

However, analysts at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey said Concho would need to show clear progress in its targeted cost goals before ""truly regaining credibility with the Street"" and questioned if the sale was the optimal longer term strategy.

The company's stock has already fallen more than 25% since it missed profit estimates for the third time in a row on July 31, leading to several brokerage cutting their price targets.

Shares of Concho were down 2.4% at $71.44 amid a broader sell off in energy stocks as oil prices tumbled on rising OPEC and Russian oil output as well as the protracted U.S.-China trade dispute.

2019-09-03 10:55:12,"Investors in HSBC Holdings plc (Symbol: HSBC) saw new options begin trading today, for the October 11th expiration. At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the HSBC options chain for the new October 11th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.

Because the $35.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 65%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.51% return on the cash commitment, or 14.55% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost .

Considering the fact that the $36.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 55%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.12% boost of extra return to the investor, or 20.39% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost .

2019-09-03 16:00:00,"   Adult life brings new financial responsibilities, and you   need to be prepared for them.  Graduating from college brings significant financial and lifestyle changes, and it's easy to feel overwhelmed. While you're trying to adjust to your new life in the workforce, you must also start paying back your student loans  and planning for your future. It's a lot to tackle at once, and many young college graduates don't know where to begin. Everyone's financial goals and budgets will vary, but there are five key things that every college graduate -- no matter their field or salary -- should do to start their adult lives off on the right foot.   Image source: Getty ImagesmakeArticleAd();  1. Start an emergency fund An emergency fund  is meant to help you cover unexpected expenses, like a medical emergency, replacing a broken home appliance, a job loss, or filing an insurance claim. Without one of these funds, you may have to charge these expenses to a credit card, or risk falling behind on your payments. Once you've gotten into a debt cycle, it's difficult to get out again, so it is worth putting some money aside now to cushion yourself against unexpected payments. Your emergency fund should contain three to six months' worth of living expenses. If you have any extra cash left over after paying your basic living expenses each month, put it here first. Once you've built up your emergency fund to an acceptable level, you can begin saving for your other financial goals. Don't forget to replenish your emergency fund if you ever need to draw upon it. And as your expenses increase, increase your emergency fund as well. 2. Set up a student loan repayment plan Private student loans may require you to pay a set amount each month, but federal student loans offer several repayment plans  , some of which are income-driven, so that you can pay less when your income is lower, and more when your income is higher. Consult with your loan servicer if you're not sure which student loan repayment plan is right for you. If you have multiple student loans, think about consolidating them  into a single loan so that you only have one monthly payment instead of several. Those planning to pursue public service  , military, or teacher loan forgiveness  should make sure they understand the rules of these programs, including acceptable repayment plans, documentation requirements, and qualifying employment. Failing to follow these rules to the letter could disqualify you from the program, or force you to wait longer for the government to forgive your remaining loans. 3. Create a budget Your monthly budget should cover your basic living expenses, including housing, utilities, insurance, transportation, and groceries. You should also include any subscriptions you pay for, as well as your student loan payments. If you have any other loans -- like a car loan -- include those as well. Once you've recorded your living expenses and your income, you must decide what to do with the money that's left over. You should put some toward an emergency fund, some toward discretionary purchases like dining out, and some toward retirement or other future savings goals. As your income increases, reevaluate your budget, and always raise your savings amount before spending more on discretionary purchases to help keep yourself on track for your financial goals. 4. Get a credit card Many millennials have chosen to forego credit cards because they don't want to risk running up credit card debt. There are other ways you can build your credit history, but credit cards are one of the easiest. You may have already had a student credit card  in college. If so, consider upgrading to a better rewards credit card  once you've landed your first job. Those without a credit history may struggle to get a credit card on their own. If you have a parent or a friend with an established credit history, they could make you an authorized user on their card. Assuming they're a responsible payer, this will help both of your credit scores. Or you can choose a secured credit card  . The credit limit is usually only a few hundred dollars on these cards, and they often require you to pay a matching security deposit. But regular, on-time payments on this card can help improve your credit score over time. 5. Open a retirement account Your earlier retirement contributions matter much more than your later ones because the money has longer to sit in your account and grow. By starting early, you can reduce the amount you need to save per month in order to hit your target amount. Your employer may offer a 401(k), and this is a good place to begin, especially if your company matches some of your contributions. Or you could open an IRA on your own. Set up automated payments if you can so that you don't have to worry about remembering to transfer the money. Your employer should do this automatically if you're enrolled in the 401(k). It takes a while to adjust to the new financial demands of adult life, but if you take the five above steps soon after graduation, you'll find the rest of it easier to manage.

  Adult life brings new financial responsibilities, and you   need to be prepared for them. 

Graduating from college brings significant financial and lifestyle changes, and it's easy to feel overwhelmed. While you're trying to adjust to your new life in the workforce, you must also start paying back your student loans  and planning for your future. It's a lot to tackle at once, and many young college graduates don't know where to begin. Everyone's financial goals and budgets will vary, but there are five key things that every college graduate -- no matter their field or salary -- should do to start their adult lives off on the right foot.

An emergency fund  is meant to help you cover unexpected expenses, like a medical emergency, replacing a broken home appliance, a job loss, or filing an insurance claim. Without one of these funds, you may have to charge these expenses to a credit card, or risk falling behind on your payments. Once you've gotten into a debt cycle, it's difficult to get out again, so it is worth putting some money aside now to cushion yourself against unexpected payments.

Your emergency fund should contain three to six months' worth of living expenses. If you have any extra cash left over after paying your basic living expenses each month, put it here first. Once you've built up your emergency fund to an acceptable level, you can begin saving for your other financial goals. Don't forget to replenish your emergency fund if you ever need to draw upon it. And as your expenses increase, increase your emergency fund as well.

Private student loans may require you to pay a set amount each month, but federal student loans offer several repayment plans  , some of which are income-driven, so that you can pay less when your income is lower, and more when your income is higher. Consult with your loan servicer if you're not sure which student loan repayment plan is right for you. If you have multiple student loans, think about consolidating them  into a single loan so that you only have one monthly payment instead of several.

Those planning to pursue public service  , military, or teacher loan forgiveness  should make sure they understand the rules of these programs, including acceptable repayment plans, documentation requirements, and qualifying employment. Failing to follow these rules to the letter could disqualify you from the program, or force you to wait longer for the government to forgive your remaining loans.

Your monthly budget should cover your basic living expenses, including housing, utilities, insurance, transportation, and groceries. You should also include any subscriptions you pay for, as well as your student loan payments. If you have any other loans -- like a car loan -- include those as well.

Once you've recorded your living expenses and your income, you must decide what to do with the money that's left over. You should put some toward an emergency fund, some toward discretionary purchases like dining out, and some toward retirement or other future savings goals. As your income increases, reevaluate your budget, and always raise your savings amount before spending more on discretionary purchases to help keep yourself on track for your financial goals.

",Workday (WDAY) Shows Momentum: Is It Part of Your Portfolio? - Nasdaq.com,https://www.nasdaq.com/article/workday-wday-shows-momentum-is-it-part-of-your-portfolio-cm1206617
2019-09-03 15:33:00," August was chock-full of negative news for stocks. A single   month is nothing, though. Try many quarters -- even years -- of   pessimism, as   Macy's    (NYSE: M) ,   Urban Outfitters    (NASDAQ: URBN) , and   Axos Financial    (NYSE: AX) shareholders have endured. Bad news has tanked all   three stocks in the past year. But bad news often spells opportunity for investors who look   beyond the headlines at the underlying business opportunity.   Stocks are, after all, shares of businesses with the ability to   dynamically adapt to changes in the economy, other business and   consumer habits, and more. Thus, though the market has been   unkind to Macy's, Urban Outfitters, and Axos Financial, three   Foolish contributors think they're cheap and worth a look right   now. Don't underestimate this department store   Nicholas Rossolillo    (Macy's):    Big changes in retail have given the department store industry a   serious black eye. Slow to pick up on the rise of online shopping   and dealing with rising competition from big-box stores that have   upped their game, department stores have seen their sales in   steady decline for years; sales are down another 4% so far in   2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.makeArticleAd(); Macy's has been a big culprit as it closes down stores to   rightsize its real estate footprint, while increasing its online   presence. The transition has been a rocky one, to say the least.   After putting up low-single-digit comparable-store sales (a   measure of the number and size of customer purchases at existing   locations) in 2018, that metric has reverted to a mere 0.5%   increase through the first half of 2019. Along with storefront   closures, revenue is down 0.6% and adjusted earnings are down   39.5%. The iconic retailer entered the year with too much inventory,   so heavy discounting has been a big reason for the earnings   decline. With the problem fixed, though, management believes it   is   on track to return to growth    , and it's looking for ways to cut expenses. Online sales have   been a bright spot; to double down on what's working best, Macy's   inked a deal with   Alphabet    's Google to optimize its inventory and distribution network.   While Macy's is certainly down, it's far from out of the game,   and remains one of the better-positioned department-store chains   to deal with an evolving consumer landscape. Nevertheless, short-term myopia has sent    Macy's stock    down over 50% this year, and shares are currently trading for a   mere 8.7 times 12-month free cash flow (basic profit after   operating expenses and capital expenditures). Toss in the facts   that Macy's has reduced long-term debt by 15% since last summer,   to $4.68 billion, and that it pays a dividend yielding 10.5%, and   this looks like one   cheap retail stock    poised for a rebound. Grab this well-oiled profit machine while it's cheap   Anders Bylund    (Urban Outfitters):    Right now, you can pick up shares of this youth-oriented clothing   and lifestyle retailer for just 9.7 times trailing earnings. The   stock also trades at less than 7.3 times trailing cash flow, or   roughly 0.6 times trailing sales. These valuation ratios sit far   below the retail sector's averages, and they also look affordable   in comparison to Urban Outfitters' five-year averages. At the same time, the company is outperforming most of its   sector peers in terms of running a solid business. With a 9.7%   operating margin and 12% return on assets over the last four   quarters, Urban Outfitters runs a tight ship. The trailing cash   conversion cycle has hovered near the 40-day mark for several   years, and is among the sector's strongest efficiency readings.   Fiscal responsibility over many years also resulted in a   squeaky-clean balance sheet with $520 million of cash equivalents   and zero long-term debt. All that being said, fashion is a notoriously trend-sensitive   industry, and even a well-run company can miss out on large   swings in consumer tastes. Urban Outfitters has had some pain on   that front over the last couple of years, including a weak   shopper response to its products in women's fashion in the second   quarter. But the company is fighting back with a successful   customer rewards program, expanded e-commerce initiatives in   several international markets, and   a strong start to the third quarter    driven by a successful back-to-school campaign. In short, we're looking at a well-run company that responds   appropriately to changes in the market. Even in difficult market   conditions, Urban Outfitters posts strong profits and   sector-leading efficiency metrics. And in case of absolute   disaster, this company could ride out a long and painful storm on   that mint-condition balance sheet. Yet investors value Urban Outfitters like a struggling chain   on the brink of bankruptcy; that's a big mistake. I see Urban   Outfitters as a fantastic buy today.   Image source: Getty Images.  Time to make another deposit   Jason Hall    (Axos Financial):    It's only been a few weeks since I last made the case that   Axos Financial was absurdly cheap    . Well, guess what? It's even cheaper now. Moreover, Axos has resoundingly answered questions about its   ability to deliver growth with a strong   yes    .   Axos reported double-digit growth in the second   quarter    across all of its most important metrics. Assets, book value per   share, interest and non-interest income, and earnings per share   all increased by at least 14% in the quarter. Since then, its stock price has fallen more than 11%. However,   it's worth noting that much of the sell-off is related to   concerns about the prospects for banks as a whole:       AX    data by   YCharts    . As you can see, both regional and big banks, as measured by   the   SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF    and   SPDR S&P Bank ETF    respectively, have fallen sharply over the past month. That   reflects the market's fears of interest-rate uncertainty, as well   as ongoing global macroeconomic turmoil that could pull the U.S.   and much of the world into recession. Sure, recession is a possibility. Heck, I'd go as far as to   say that recession isn't just possible, it's   inevitable    , and people   do    need to   prepare for the next recession    . The thing is, to invest in stocks for the long term and   generate long-term wealth, you need to ride out market downturns,   and not get caught up in the mistake of trying to time your way   around the next crash. Right now, Axos trades for less than 8.5 times 2019 earnings   estimates. That's crazy-cheap for a company that's generated   double-digi   t earnings    growth for years, and that has the capacity to grow earnings at   double-digit rates for many more years to come. Even if we see a   recession in the next year or so, investors who buy Axos at   today's valuation, and hold for the long term, could find   themselves very glad they did.   10 stocks we like better than Macy's       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Along with storefront   closures, revenue is down 0.6% and adjusted earnings are down   39.5%.

The iconic retailer entered the year with too much inventory,   so heavy discounting has been a big reason for the earnings   decline. With the problem fixed, though, management believes it   is   on track to return to growth    , and it's looking for ways to cut expenses. Online sales have   been a bright spot; to double down on what's working best, Macy's   inked a deal with   Alphabet    's Google to optimize its inventory and distribution network.   While Macy's is certainly down, it's far from out of the game,   and remains one of the better-positioned department-store chains   to deal with an evolving consumer landscape.

Nevertheless, short-term myopia has sent    Macy's stock    down over 50% this year, and shares are currently trading for a   mere 8.7 times 12-month free cash flow (basic profit after   operating expenses and capital expenditures). Toss in the facts   that Macy's has reduced long-term debt by 15% since last summer,   to $4.68 billion, and that it pays a dividend yielding 10.5%, and   this looks like one   cheap retail stock    poised for a rebound.

  Anders Bylund    (Urban Outfitters):    Right now, you can pick up shares of this youth-oriented clothing   and lifestyle retailer for just 9.7 times trailing earnings. The   stock also trades at less than 7.3 times trailing cash flow, or   roughly 0.6 times trailing sales. These valuation ratios sit far   below the retail sector's averages, and they also look affordable   in comparison to Urban Outfitters' five-year averages.

At the same time, the company is outperforming most of its   sector peers in terms of running a solid business. With a 9.7%   operating margin and 12% return on assets over the last four   quarters, Urban Outfitters runs a tight ship. The trailing cash   conversion cycle has hovered near the 40-day mark for several   years, and is among the sector's strongest efficiency readings.   Fiscal responsibility over many years also resulted in a   squeaky-clean balance sheet with $520 million of cash equivalents   and zero long-term debt.

All that being said, fashion is a notoriously trend-sensitive   industry, and even a well-run company can miss out on large   swings in consumer tastes. Urban Outfitters has had some pain on   that front over the last couple of years, including a weak   shopper response to its products in women's fashion in the second   quarter. But the company is fighting back with a successful   customer rewards program, expanded e-commerce initiatives in   several international markets, and   a strong start to the third quarter    driven by a successful back-to-school campaign.

In short, we're looking at a well-run company that responds   appropriately to changes in the market. Even in difficult market   conditions, Urban Outfitters posts strong profits and   sector-leading efficiency metrics. And in case of absolute   disaster, this company could ride out a long and painful storm on   that mint-condition balance sheet.

Yet investors value Urban Outfitters like a struggling chain   on the brink of bankruptcy; that's a big mistake. I see Urban   Outfitters as a fantastic buy today.

  Jason Hall    (Axos Financial):    It's only been a few weeks since I last made the case that   Axos Financial was absurdly cheap    . Well, guess what? It's even cheaper now.

Moreover, Axos has resoundingly answered questions about its   ability to deliver growth with a strong   yes    .   Axos reported double-digit growth in the second   quarter    across all of its most important metrics. Assets, book value per   share, interest and non-interest income, and earnings per share   all increased by at least 14% in the quarter.

Since then, its stock price has fallen more than 11%. However,   it's worth noting that much of the sell-off is related to   concerns about the prospects for banks as a whole:

 AX    data by   YCharts    .

As you can see, both regional and big banks, as measured by   the   SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF    and   SPDR S&P Bank ETF    respectively, have fallen sharply over the past month. That   reflects the market's fears of interest-rate uncertainty, as well   as ongoing global macroeconomic turmoil that could pull the U.S.   and much of the world into recession.

Sure, recession is a possibility. Heck, I'd go as far as to   say that recession isn't just possible, it's   inevitable    , and people   do    need to   prepare for the next recession    . The thing is, to invest in stocks for the long term and   generate long-term wealth, you need to ride out market downturns,   and not get caught up in the mistake of trying to time your way   around the next crash.

Right now, Axos trades for less than 8.5 times 2019 earnings   estimates. That's crazy-cheap for a company that's generated   double-digi   t earnings    growth for years, and that has the capacity to grow earnings at   double-digit rates for many more years to come. Even if we see a   recession in the next year or so, investors who buy Axos at   today's valuation, and hold for the long term, could find   themselves very glad they did.

2019-09-03 07:32:00,"By Ali Kucukgocmen and Kenneth Li

ISTANBUL/NEW YORK, Sept 3 (Reuters) - U.S. online streaming service Netflix  has applied for a license to continue operating in Turkey under new online broadcasting rules that have raised fears over possible censorship in the future.

Turkey last month granted its radio and television watchdog sweeping oversight over all online content, including streaming platforms and news outlets, a move that raised concerns that the state was tightening its control over the media. 

As part of obtaining the license, the Los Gatos, California-based subscription streaming service will set up a local entity and pay 0.5% of revenue generated in Turkey to the government. The company said it is in discussions to pay similar levies in Spain and Italy.

Netflix serves 1.5 million subscribers in Turkey and only reaches about 10% of the country's broadband households, the company said, making the Turkish market a potentially important and lucrative source of new subscribers as competition mounts.

The company operates one of the world's largest streaming services and has sustained its position at the top by courting new subscribers outside the United States as its U.S. home market matures.

To date, Turkey has not attempted to censor Netflix content, a source familiar with the matter said.

Turkey's new regulation stipulates that content providers should get a fresh license to continue operating in Turkey, and comply with RTUK guidelines.

If they don't respect the guidelines, they will be given 30 days to change their content, or face having their licenses suspended for three months and later canceled. The announcement last month did not specify what standards RTUK would expect.

Critics have said the move will allow the government to tighten its grip on Turkish media, which is largely owned or controlled by supporters of President Tayyip Erdogan and his ruling AK Party. 

GROWTH MARKET

Netflix and the Saudi Arabian government were widely condemned when the company pulled an episode of the comedy show, ""Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj"" from its Saudi Arabia service in January, after officials complained. The show was critical of Saudi Arabia after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. 

Unlike other popular internet-based content providers and services, including Alphabet Inc'sYouTube and Twitter Inc , which were banned at one time in Turkey, Netflix is generally not a platform for news or current affairs.

Netflix is hoping a proactive approach to working with local regulators, such as by bolstering parental controls, would help it address potential censorship issues down the line, the source said.

""Our goal is to protect children from content that may be inappropriate for their age, while ensuring our members can continue to watch the shows and films of their choice,"" a Netflix spokesman said on Monday.

Netflix declined to comment about potential censorship concerns beyond its statement.

In the quarter ended June 30, it lost subscribers in the United States for the first time in eight years and fell short of targets for new subscriber growth overseas. Netflix executives said it would still meet its annual target.

In Turkey, it has invested in local programming and some of its TV series have attracted international audiences, including ""The Protector,"" about an Istanbul shopkeeper who battles immortal enemies.

Netflix has ordered two seasons of ""The Gift"" - another Turkish supernatural drama - and has commissioned the Turkish series, ""Love 101.""

Shares of Netflix were down 1% to $290.86 on Nasdaq. ",Netflix applies for license under new Turkish broadcasting rules - Nasdaq.com,https://www.nasdaq.com/article/netflix-applies-for-license-under-new-turkish-broadcasting-rules-20190903-00881

The nominations include Sudan's first female foreign minister, and a former World Bank economist as its new finance minister who will a face an economic crisis that has deepened in recent months.

Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok approved them along with 12 other new ministers, a member of the main civilian group in the ruling Sovereign Council said.

Adel Ibrahim was tapped to lead the Energy and Mining Ministry, the source said. General Jamal Aldin Omar will lead the defence portfolio, he added.

The government will lead a three-year transition to elections under a power-sharing deal between the military and civilian opposition.

2019-09-03 16:40:00,"The U.S.-China trade war looms more heavily than ever over the markets and the global economic picture continues to worsen. Nonetheless, stocks will still play a vital role as Wall Street giants and investors need to find returns somewhere amid the current interest rate environment. One way to find solid investments, with potential for big returns, is to search for stocks that more analysts have started to cover recently.

Broker recommendations play their part no matter how investors feel about them. And we seemingly all take a look no matter what. Individual investors, large institutional portfolio managers, and everyone in between are likely pleased to see one of their stocks get an upgraded rating or a new analyst covers the company.

Right off the bat, investor interest can generate more analyst coverage. This helps explain why analysts jump on young, much-hyped and talked about tech companies. Then, as new coverage is initiated, the company and the stock become more visible, which in turn often leads to more demand potential and therefore the possibility of higher prices. 

Plus, analysts almost always initiate coverage with a positive recommendation. And the logic follows because why spend all the time and write a research report on a company not widely tracked only to say it's not good?

When it comes to companies with little to no analyst coverage, one new recommendation can sometimes give portfolio managers the validation they need to build a position. And the more money they can invest, the more they can potentially influence prices.

The best way to use this information is to search for companies with analyst coverage that has increased over the last 4 weeks. We just look at the number of analyst recommendations today and compare it to the number of analyst recommendations 4 weeks ago.

The rule of thumb here is that an increase in coverage leans bullish and a decrease signals bearish behavior. It is also worth pointing out that, in general, the change in the average broker recommendation is a better indicator than the actual recommendation itself.

On top of that, it is typically more bullish if the increase went from none to one or if the coverage was minimal to begin with. (As the number of analysts climbs the addition of new coverage isn't earth-shattering.) In the end, increased coverage is still better than decreased coverage, unless the coverage is heading in the wrong direction. 

Now let's try this screen…

• Number of Broker Ratings now greater than the Number of Broker Ratings four weeks ago

(This shows stocks where new coverage has recently been added.)

• Average Broker Rating less than Average Broker Rating four weeks ago

(By 'less than', we mean 'better than' four weeks ago.)

• Prices greater than or equal to 5

(We're applying all of the above parameters to stocks above $5 a share since many money managers won't even look at stocks under $5)

• Average Daily Volume greater than or equal to 100,000 shares

(If there's not enough volume, even individual investors won't want it).

Here are three of the nine stocks that came through the screen this week…

ACM Research, Inc. (ACMR) - (from 2 analyst four weeks ago to 4)

K12 Inc. (LRN) - (from 2 analysts four weeks ago to 3)

Central Garden & Pet Company (CENT) - (from 1 analysts four weeks ago to 4)

2019-09-03 07:00:00,"MILAN, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Italian credit data and information group Cerved  has hired Mediobanca as an adviser to study options for its bad loan unit, as the market gears up for consolidation.

""Such an assessment is still at a preliminary stage and no decision has been taken,"" Cerved said in a statement on Tuesday.

Italy's loan recovery industry is in ferment with players looking to bulk up in the face of slowing disposals by banks after years of massive bad loan sales and regulatory changes.

Credito Fondiario, in turn, recently hired Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank to assess strategic options. 

Cerved is evaluating possibilities after losing in June a 10-year bad loan management contract with Monte dei Paschi di Siena .

Forced by regulators to speed up its balance sheet clean-up, the Tuscan bank chose to terminate the contract early, paying a hefty penalty fee, to have more freedom to shed bad debts. 

Also, Cerved's joint attempt with U.S. funds Elliott and Bain Capital to bid for soured debts and a majority stake in a bad loan unit put up for sale by Eurobank  ran aground when the Greek bank in June entered exclusive talks with Pimco. 

Cerved could now decide to sell its loan management division and concentrate on its credit information business, which it recently strengthened through a small acquisition. 

""Our concentration in terms of clients (of the bad loan management unit) is very low. As multi-client, we could be of interest for someone bigger which has, however, just one or two clients,"" Cerved CEO Andrea Mignanelli told Reuters last month.

At 1013 GMT, shares in Cerved were up 2.8%, bucking a 0.3% drop in the Italian market .

The group reported in July a 10% yearly rise in first-half revenues to 246 million euros ($274 million), with the loan management division accounting for 87 million, up 30.5% year-on-year.

Cerved, which has a market value of nearly 1.5 billion euros, earlier this year caught the eye of buyout firm Advent, which however dropped its takeover bid after news of its offer leaked.

2019-09-03 08:45:00,"September is here, and as the weather shifts and leaves fall, investors are trying to shake out what's next for the broader market and individual companies in their portfolios and on their watch lists. Temperatures may be cooling, but concerns about a global economic slowdown and the trade dispute between the U.S. and China have recently been heating up, and stock pickers are looking for signs to determine whether the bull market will continue its run.

With that in mind, let's look at some companies with earnings reports this month that could grab headlines and have broader implications for the market. The table below lists seven of them.

Data source: Yahoo! Finance.

Here's why their stocks are worth keeping an eye on this month.

Image source: Getty Images.

It's been on a roll with its quarterly reports, surpassing the average analys t earnings target in each of its last four quarters and putting up stellar revenue growth and stock performance. The database computing company has been on a tear this year, and its stock has climbed roughly 375% since market close on the day of its initial public offering in October 2017.

Investors will be watching to see if it can keep its strong sales growth streak alive and whether its Atlas database-as-a-service business serves up another quarter of blistering growth. MongoDB is also scheduled to present at the Citi Global Technology Conference on Sept. 6 and the Deutsche Bank Technology Conference on Sept. 10, so it's shaping up to be a big news month for the high-flying tech company.

GameStop has struggled as video game sales have continued to migrate to digital-distribution channels. And the company's efforts to build its business in areas like game development and publishing and mobile-phone stores have fallen short. It suspended its dividend earlier this year because it needs to redirect cash back into the business in order to better position itself for the changing games market.

The upcoming second-quarter report should provide some insight on how same-store sales and cost-reduction initiatives are doing -- as well as some color and guidance related to the performance of video game console hardware, games from leading publishers, and the pop-culture merchandise space that hosts big players like Funko .

The semiconductor market can be a good bellwether for the broader technology sector because chips are core components in consumer-level and enterprise-level devices and infrastructure.

Broadcom's management shed light on how big tech companies are reading and dealing with some macroeconomic headwinds. The company has seen its outlook affected by the U.S.-China trade war. And restrictions placed on dealing with Chinese hardware company Huawei have meant that it appears to have lost (at least temporarily) one of its biggest customers.

Broadcom revealed several weeks ago that it would be acquiring Symantec 's enterprise security business for $10.7 billion, and investors may get extra information on the big deal, which is expected to close before the year is out. Management could offer additional color about its big push into software and its appetite for additional acquisitions.

Big tech stocks have shown some weakness in recent weeks as signs of softening demand among leading industry players have combined with some worrying economic indicators in global market s to shake investor confidence. Oracle stock has retreated from the record high it hit with its las t earnings report , but investors will still be looking for signs of solid momentum for its cloud service offerings. The company's role as a top enterprise software provider means that its upcoming quarterly report and guidance could also provide a view into broader corporate sentiment about macroeconomic conditions.

September could bring some legal news for the company as well. Oracle has appealed the July dismissal of its lawsuit challenging the Pentagon's bidding process for the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) cloud computing contract that is valued at upward of $10 billion. The suit alleges that the government violated procurement laws and that the bidding process unfairly favored Amazon and was unduly influenced by personal relationships.

Oracle's board of directors also gave the go-ahead in August for a billion-dollar shareholder lawsuit against company executives Larry Ellison and Safra Catz, with the suit alleging that the executives breached their fiduciary duties by paying a substantial premium to acquire NetSuite in a $9.3 billion deal that was completed in 2016.

Shareholders will be watching to see if the company's first-quarter report and guidance have the business on track to continue its impressive sales and earnings growth. Its performance and outlook could also provide insight into broader economic sentiment. Because it provides workplace uniforms and cleaning services, demand for its products could be an indicator of whether businesses are still feeling confident about expanding.

The uniform rental company's stock trades in the neighborhood of its record high and has benefited from strong economic growth over the last decade. With concerns about worsening macroeconomic conditions potentially starting to mount, Cintas'  upcoming first-quarter report could provide a better picture of the business' near-term outlook and a marker for gauging enterprise sentiment on a wider scale.

Micron's fourth-quarter release will provide new information for assessing how the DRAM (or dynamic random access memory) and NAND flash-memory markets are shaping up. DRAM and NAND chip prices have been dragged down by inventory glut, but signs that the memory-chip market may have already reached the bottom of its cycle have propelled stock rebounds for industry leaders in 2019.

Micron's results and guidance may provide some outlook on the broader consumer-tech space, enterprise categories like data centers, and what to expect from other memory-chip specialists like Western Digital  and SMART Global Holdings . Micron's earnings report and conference call may also shed some extra light on the business' dealings with Huawei, one of Micron's biggest customers. The memory specialist has stated that it has a legal workaround that will allow it to continue selling some of its products to the Chinese company. It's worth keeping an eye on how that plays out.

It las t report ed earnings in June, raising its full-year guidance and powering the stock to a record high. Investors will want to see if management's bullish outlook has shifted at all with the upcoming third-quarter report and conference call. J.P. Morgan analyst Ken Goldman cut his rating on the spice giant from neutral to underweight in August, creating some recent downward pressure for the stock. Its second-quarter report arrived with comments from management suggesting there would be strong sales performance in the second half of the year, and in the holiday period particularly, so third-quarter revenue and guidance will be under the microscope.

Investors will also get more news about Brexit, which could have an impact on McCormick's business -- as cited in Ken Goldman's note. Whether there will be a ""no deal"" exit that could lead to increased shipping expenses should be clear by the end of September.

McCormick will also be presenting at the Barclays Global Consumer Staples Conference on Sept. 4.

2019-09-03 15:23:00,"Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel  , in trading on Tuesday, shares of BGC Partners Inc - Class A (Symbol: BGCP) were yielding above the 11% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $0.56), with the stock changing hands as low as $4.99 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the iShares Russell 3000 ETF ( IWV  ) back on 5/31/2000 - you would have paid $78.27 per share. Fast forward to 5/31/2012 and each share was worth $77.79 on that date, a loss of $0.48 or 0.6% decrease over twelve years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $10.77 per share in dividends over the same period, increasing your return to 13.15%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.0%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 11% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. BGC Partners Inc - Class A (Symbol: BGCP) is a member of the Russell 3000, giving it special status as one of the largest 3000 companies on the U.S. stock markets.      In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company.

2019-09-03 09:31:00,"Content delivery specialist Akamai Networks (NASDAQ: AKAM) is on a roll at the moment. The stock has gained 46% over the last 52 weeks and is trading near multiyear highs. Apart from a speculative spike in the dot-com boom at the turn of the millennium, we're looking at all-time record prices here.

Is Akamai worth buying at these elevated prices, or is it time to back away from an overheated stock? Let's have a look.

Image source: Getty Images.

There's a simple truth behind Akamai's surging stock prices: Business is booming.

Akamai's trailing revenues have grown 50% larger in five years. Free cash flow rose 72% over the same period. Adjusted earnings took a dip in 2017 and early 2018, then mounted a strong comeback. That metric increased by 37% in five years, including a 64% boost over the last year alone.

During the same five-year time span, Akamai's valuation ratios have bounced around in a relatively steady range. The price-to-earnings ratio now sits at 33.4, just 5% below where it was in the summer of 2014. The stock is also trading at 25 times free cash flow, 23% below the value five years ago and fairly consistent with the long-term trend.

In recent earnings calls , Akamai's management pinned the earnings improvements on strong sales of its security services . The media and carrier segment, which consists of Akamai's delivery platforms for audio and video content, posted 4% year-over-year growth in the recently reported second quarter, while security sales surged 32% higher.

Akamai also reaped huge rewards from the Trump administration's tax reform in 2017. The company's effective tax rate had been hovering near the 30% line for half a decade when the corporate tax rules were overhauled The tax rate has been sitting near 14% since then, and Akamai's management expects it to stay below 20% for the long haul.

Data security is a hot sector right now and Akamai is carving out a valuable niche within that space as a leading provider of cloud security tools. That effort should keep revenues and profits rising for several years. When the security trend cools down, we'll see Akamai moving forward at long-term growth rates closer to the more mature content delivery division's current velocity.

That's why investors aren't paying a growth-stock premium for Akamai's shares here. The high-octane epoch of the company's business prospects looks very exciting in the short term but less interesting from a longer perspective.

Furthermore, Akamai's tax-based advantages could come to an abrupt end if the next election cycle results in a left-leaning administration that sets out to reverse Trump's corporate tax cuts in a hurry. My crystal ball is in for repairs, so I can't say for sure that this will happen, but Akamai is exposed to significant tax risk.

I thought Akamai looked overpriced and speculative a year ago , and the stock has only raced higher since then. This stock could suit a certain type of investor betting on the security boom lasting a bit longer. That's fine, as long as you realize that the stock could come tumbling back down for reasons as varied as a calmer network security sector or a certain outcome in the 2020 elections. I'm not a buyer at this point, despite Akamai's good-looking financial data trends.

2019-09-03 09:32:00,"Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (NYSE: BIP) is a value investor at heart. Because of that, the company won't invest in an opportunity unless it meets its strict criteria, even if it's in a market segment that Brookfield's specifically targeting. In recent years, for example, the company has publicly stated that it wanted to make acquisitions in Mexico as well as in the Indian telecom tower sector. It had opportunities in both areas in the past but chose to walk away because the returns didn't meet its high bar.

Instead of compromising on returns, Brookfield remained patient. That approach has paid off as it recently announced deals in both regions. CEO Sam Pollock discussed why the company was finally able to make these long-awaited moves on the second-quarter conference call .

Image source: Getty Images.

Pollock stated on the call:

A number of you will know that we opened an office in Mexico in 2015 with the intention of establishing a local presence in the country, consistent with the approach we've done in many other places. Up until now, we've not seen opportunities to acquire assets at appropriate risk-adjusted returns. We went to Mexico as we view it as a very business-friendly country with good market fundamentals, and we see the value of investing in the country over the long term.

The company highlighted Mexico in early 2017. That was because President Trump's threats to reduce trade between the U.S. and Mexico had created a lot of uncertainty. Brookfield thought this situation would allow it to make value-based acquisitions. Those opportunities, however, failed to materialize. Pollock later noted the cause as ""probably a little bit of a disparity between views on valuations between buyers and sellers.""

While it took much longer than expected, that disparity has finally narrowed because ""institutional interest [in the Mexican market] has moderated somewhat"" in recent months, according to Pollock. ""This created an opportunity for us to enter the market and acquire a low-risk, high-quality asset within our target return range."" In this particular deal, the company bought a recently built pipeline that transports natural gas from the U.S. to Mexico. Pollock noted that ""the business is very attractive as the pipelines generate stable and predictable cash flows without volume or commodity price risk."" That makes it an excellent fit for Brookfield since it will enhance the long-term sustainability of the company's high-yield dividend.

Pollock then turned his attention to another recent transaction. He stated that ""you also may be aware that we've been monitoring opportunities in the telecom market in India for the past several years."" The company had a deal in place in 2017 to invest in a portfolio of 40,000 towers. However, it was conditional on the merger of two telecom companies, which didn't proceed as planned.

The Indian telecom market, however, has since consolidated and stabilized. Because of that, Brookfield was recently able to acquire a portfolio of 130,000 towers. Pollock noted that this business ""generates stable and predictable cash flows that will benefit from expected increases in data usage."" That's why he believes ""this is a great opportunity to penetrate a high-growth market at our target returns.""

Image source: Getty Images.

Mexico and the Indian telecom tower sector aren't the only two areas where the company has been patiently waiting for the right opportunity. It's also on the lookout for deals in the water infrastructure and airport segments.

While Brookfield did make a small deal for a water irrigation system in Peru in 2017, it wants to make a much bigger splash in the sector. It's looking for opportunities in water supply, transportation, and recycling. At some point the right deal will likely emerge, especially given the vastness of the market potential. According to one estimate, the shortfall between government investment in water infrastructure and the global need is a staggering $6.7 trillion by 2050.

Brookfield is also looking for a deal to diversify its transportation infrastructure business to include operating airports. The company had an agreement in place in 2015 to acquire a company that had the right to operate an airport in Brazil, but it fell apart. As a result, Brookfield is still waiting for the right opportunity. Pollock noted on the second-quarter call that the company is actively monitoring the airport sector in India, which it thinks ""is a very attractive sector."" Because of that, ""if something came along there, I think that's something we'd look at.""

By sticking to its strict return criteria, Brookfield can make deals that move the needle. Its recent slate of acquisitions, for example, will help boost its cash flow per unit by 20% from where it was a year ago. That outsized growth rate is increasing the long-term sustainability of the company's 4.3%-yielding dividend while giving it the fuel to grow that payout at a faster pace in the future.

2019-09-03 07:19:00,"By Giulio Piovaccari

MILAN, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Industrial vehicle maker CNH Industrial  has decided to split in two and list its truck, bus and engine division in an effort to boost asset values and streamline its businesses.

The plan comes just six years after CNH Industrial was created when Fiat Industrial - spun off from the Italian carmaker - was folded into U.S.-based agricultural and construction machine firm CNH.

Monica Bosio, head of equity research at Intesa Sanpaolo-Banca IMI, said the plan should help boost the value of the agriculture side, which is currently trading at a discount compared to competitors.

""The split should also give more appeal to the truck unit as it might become an interesting asset for other operators, despite the pledge by Exor to remain key shareholder in both entities,"" she said.

CNH's top shareholder Exor - the holding group of Italy's Agnelli family, which also controls Fiat Chrysler Automobiles  and premium sports car maker Ferrari  - said in a statement it supported the new plan.

""Exor will continue to be the shareholder of reference in both entities following completion of the spin-off process,"" it said.

Last year, CNH's agriculture and construction business had proforma sales of $15.6 billion, while its so-called ""On-Highway"" operations generated $13.1 billion.

The group's most profitable businesses were agricultural equipment and powertrains, which both boasted margins of 8.9% compared with the 2.7% of commercial vehicles.

Under the plan, some high-margin industrial vehicle brands including heavy-duty quarry truck maker Astra and Iveco Defence Vehicles will be assigned to the agricultural and construction unit.

""The agricultural entity will trade at higher multiples from the beginning, despite the challenging environment, because that's the business with higher margins. Multiples at the truck entity might increase depending on the management's ability to extract margins and eventual M&A perspectives,"" Bosio added.

But in a sign agricultural margins could also come under pressure, U.S. rival Deere & Co.  last month announced a review of costs after bad weather and the U.S.-China trade war dented profits, triggering a profit warning. 

""It looks as if (Exor head John) Elkann is focusing on cash-in deals to help fund asset diversification at Exor,"" said Roberto Lottici, asset manager at Milan-based Ifigest.

The new plan, dubbed ""Transform 2 Win"" will reduce operating costs and increase efficiency ""through targeted restructuring actions"", CNH said in a statement.

The group expects full implementation of the plan by the end of 2022 and to spend between $450-$500 million in restructuring charges.

In a separate statement, CNH said it planned to enter a strategic and exclusive partnership for Iveco with U.S.-based Nikola Corporation, as it seeks to accelerate its transition towards emission neutrality for heavy-duty trucks in North America and Europe.

The Italian-American group will take a $250 million stake in Nikola, which will kick-off the production of a zero-emission heavy-duty vehicle powered by proprietary hydrogen fuel cell and battery technology, it said.

Massimiliano Chiara, the company's CFO, laid out increases in capex and research and development (R&D) as part of the new plan. Chiara said capex would go up from 1.9% of net sales this year to 3.5% in 2020 and average 3.7% between 2020 and 2024. R&D spending, meanwhile, will go up from 3.8% of net sales to 4.2% in 2020 and average 4.5% from 2020 to 2024.

Milan-listed CNH shares were down 3.5%, having risen as much as 1% when the break-up plan was announced.",CNH Industrial to list truck and bus business in break-up - Nasdaq.com,https://www.nasdaq.com/article/cnh-industrial-to-list-truck-and-bus-business-in-breakup-20190903-00824
2019-09-03 09:29:40,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Most people say option trading is risky.

Novice traders often don't take the time to learn the right way to use options. They jump right in - thinking, ""I got this.""

They gamble, blow up their accounts, and then walk away penniless and swearing off options forever.

Even experienced traders sometimes get caught up in the allure of fast gains. They overleverage their positions - take a bigger position size than they should - and then take a hit. All the option traders I know, including myself, have blown up their accounts at least once.

But it's not the option that's risky… it's the strategy. And when used the right way, options are far less risky than trading stocks.

You see, most people use options the wrong way. Most people use options to increase leverage… to get more ""bang for their buck."" In other words, most people use options to increase risk.

That's wrong. That's the exact opposite of what options were designed for.

The options market was created so investors could  reduce risk . Options allow investors to hedge their positions… and to risk much less money than they would buying a stock outright.

Let's say you want to buy stock in Company X. It trades for $10 a share. You could put up $1,000 to buy 100 shares… But you can control the same amount of stock with one option contract. You can buy a contract for, let's say, $50… and leave the other $950 in your account.

If Company X's stock goes up, you'll make money. If the stock goes down, the most you'll ever lose is that $50. That's a 100% loss… but it's a lot less than potentially losing 20% or more of the $1,000 you risked buying the stock.

This is a simple example. And it's the simplicity that proves my point. Options allow you to risk much less and profit just as much as you would when buying stocks.

But that benefit disappears if you overleverage the trade and take on a larger position with options than you would otherwise take with the stock.

That's the biggest mistake most novice option traders make. Instead of replacing a 100-share purchase with one call option, they take the entire amount they would have allocated to the stock and buy a much larger position with the options.

Rather than buying one call option for $50 and leaving the remaining $950 in the bank, novice traders take the entire $1,000 and put it into buying more call options.

They end up buying 20 call options to try to get more bang for their buck. What would have been a 100-share purchase has turned into control of 2,000 shares. Instead of using options to reduce risk, they've increased their risk 20 times.

Losing 100% on an overleveraged trade would be a disaster. And it's why most folks think option trading is dangerous. But it's not dangerous if you trade options the way they were originally intended…  as a way to reduce risk .

Limit your option exposure to control just the number of shares you would normally purchase. Leave the rest of the money in the bank. Then it won't be so bad to lose 100% on an option trade.

It will almost always turn out better than what you could have lost on the stock.

Best regards and good trading,

Jeff Clark

P.S.  Trading options isn't inherently risky… It all depends on the strategy you use. And the strategy I recently uncovered in the gold market could make you a fortune… no matter what gold does.

You see, it's one thing to make money on gold by holding long-term investments or buying bullion. And you wouldn't be wrong to consider those options. But what I've uncovered could make you up to five or 10 times more money on gold than those ""buy-and-hold"" investments.

2019-09-03 14:00:00,"  Moving overseas doesn't get you out of paying your student   loans.  Student loans shouldn't hold you back from pursuing your dreams, even if that dream is to live abroad. Moving overseas while carrying student loan debt can be scary and cause hesitation. But with proper planning and some financial strategy, it can actually be advantageous and help to pay off your student loans faster  . Here's what you need to do to prepare your student loans  before moving abroad.   Image source: Getty ImagesmakeArticleAd();  Figure out if you'll need an international bank account Depending on your current bank and employer, you may want to open an international bank account in order to access your funds while abroad. Major banks like Chase and CitiBank have branches all over the world, increasing your chances that they will have a local branch close to where you'll be living. But if your bank is limited to the U.S. and you plan on living abroad long-term, you'll probably want to open a local bank account. Indeed, if you are employed by a local company in another country, they may need you to open an international bank account so that you can get paid. However, if you're still working for an American company, you can probably keep your U.S. account and continue making student loan payments like you always have. Once you've worked out whether you need an international bank account, it is important to find out whether your provider will accept student loan payments from it. Student loan payment options for people living abroad There are several options for making your student loan payments while living abroad. You should get your bank accounts in order and determine the best payment method before moving overseas. This will help you maximize your funds by avoiding potential fees and provide you with an organized plan so you never miss a payment. Paying student loans with a U.S. bank account if you're working for a U.S. company If you're living abroad but working for a U.S. company that can deposit your paycheck into your U.S. bank account, the solution is easy -- pay your student loans directly from your U.S. bank account. This is the best-case scenario for seamlessly managing your student loan repayment while living abroad. Paying student loans with a U.S. bank account if you're working for an international company If you're working for a company abroad that deposits your paychecks into an international bank account, you probably won't be able to pay your student loans directly from that account. In this case, you'll need to set up regular transfers from your international bank account to your U.S. one so that you can pay your student loans from there. Not only will you be responsible for managing the additional step of making the transfers, it's likely you'll incur transfer fees as well. Always make sure you have enough money in your U.S. bank account to pay your loans on time:  Start by putting extra funds in your account to act as a   safety net while you figure out the transfer process and   timeline. Set up automatic transfers to your U.S. account so that you   always have enough money there. Transfers can take a few days to process, so make sure you   set them up to arrive well before your student loan payment   date. Talk with your bank to figure out the best way to deposit   money from an international account and plan for what the fees   will be.  Paying student loans with a credit card You'll need to make sure your student loan provider accepts credit card payments, (federal student loan providers do not), and find out whether there are any associated fees for using a credit card. This isn't the best option because of associated fees, but it can work in a pinch. You'll need to use a U.S. credit card to make your student loan payment, and then you'll also need to use a U.S. bank account to pay off your credit card bill without incurring additional fees. Make sure you pay your bill immediately to avoid interest charges. The benefit of this method is that you get a short grace period between when you make your student loan payment and when you have to pay off your credit card. If you're in a bind -- for example, if your money didn't transfer to your U.S. bank account in time to pay your student loans -- this option can work in your favor. What to discuss with your student loan provider before moving abroad Before packing up your life and moving to another country, talk with your student loan provider so everyone is on the same page. This can help you avoid any payment mishaps or confusion, so your student loans don't hold you back while abroad.   Give them your international address and phone   number:    Ensure your loan provider has your most up-to-date information in   case they need to contact you. Provide them with your new local   address or the address of someone who is reliable and close to   you, like a parent. Update your phone number and email so you   don't miss any important information or documents that may be   sent to you.  Create a document with your lender's contact information,   due dates, and monthly payment information:    Keep track of your payments all in one place while you're abroad.   Create a simple spreadsheet that's stored in the cloud and can be   accessed from any device in case your device is lost or stolen.   The more organized you are up-front, the less likely you will be   to forget about your student loans while figuring out your new   life.  Ask about any fees involved with paying by your method of   choice:    Credit card processing fees, bank transfer fees, and foreign   transaction fees can add up quickly, especially when they aren't   planned for. Make sure you understand what fees may be incurred   and explore other payment options to avoid unnecessary fees.  Consider setting up autopay:    This is crucial to make sure you stay on top of your payments   while living abroad. Ask your loan provider if they offer any   discounts for setting up autopay -- some providers offer a 0.25%   reduction just for setting one up. You'll save money and avoid   missing any payments. The key here is to always make sure you   have enough money in your bank account to make the monthly   payment.        Decide whether your current repayment plan will still work for you once you move abroad Since you're moving abroad and likely changing jobs, it's important you make sure your repayment plan is still the best option for you given your new salary and cost of living. Private lenders don't always offer flexible repayment plans, but your federal loans come with a number of flexible repayment options  . You can consider refinancing your student loans  if you have good credit. This can lower your monthly payments and save you money by reducing your interest rate. However, it can also extend your repayment period and cause you to lose out on other benefits. Be sure to compare rates and benefits before signing up for a new loan.  Student loan consolidation  is also worth considering. It can simplify your payments so you don't have to worry about multiple due dates and payments while abroad. The downside is that consolidation may also extend your repayment period and leave you paying more over the life of your loan. At the same time, if you have less disposable income overseas, it could make your monthly payments more manageable. You should weigh the pros and cons for your given situation before jumping into loan consolidation. Pay off your student loans early if you can Living abroad can actually benefit you when it comes to paying off your student loans. If you're able to maintain your current salary while moving to an area with a lower cost of living, or if you're able to secure a job that includes housing, you'll immediately have more disposable income. Those extra funds can be put toward your student loans to save you money in interest and pay down your balance faster. However, this takes commitment, as you may be tempted to use that additional cash flow to explore your new surroundings. Moving to a new country doesn't make your student loans disappear. Set yourself up for success by organizing your finances ahead of time and keeping in touch with your student loan provider. It's easy to get caught up in the adventure and newness of living abroad, but you must stay on top of managing your student debt in order to prevent your loans from going into default and wreaking havoc on your finances.

2019-09-03 17:03:00,"Sept 3 (Reuters) - Tyson Foods Inc  lowered its 2019 adjusted earnings forecast on Tuesday, citing a litany of causes including a recent fire at its Holcomb slaughterhouse and volatility in the commodity market.

The fire resulted in an unforeseen shutdown at the slaughterhouse in Kansas last month, likely curtailing Tyson's meat processing operations.

The company also appears challenged by higher prices for animal feeds such as corn because of unprecedented planting delays this spring due to widespread flooding.

Tyson said slower-than-expected operational improvements in the chicken segment and implementation of enhanced food safety initiatives were among the factors hurting its full-year profit.

""The discrete challenges we've encountered this quarter now lead us to believe we will fall short of our previously stated guidance,"" said Noel White, Tyson Foods' chief executive officer.

Tyson now expects to earn an adjusted profit between $5.30 and $5.70 per share, from a prior forecast of $5.75 to $6.10 per share. 

Shares of the company fell 6% in after-hours trading.

 Tuesday's forecast comes nearly a month after the company posted better-than-expected third quarter earnings, which sent its shares to a record high.

However, Tyson said its outlook for fiscal 2020 remains positive as it expects more favorable market conditions.

Tyson has been upbeat about the next fiscal year as it looks to reap benefits from the spread of African Swine Fever, a fatal hog disease in China.","Tyson cuts profit forecast, says slaughterhouse fire among challenges - Nasdaq.com",https://www.nasdaq.com/article/tyson-cuts-profit-forecast-says-slaughterhouse-fire-among-challenges-20190903-01251

2019-09-03 09:00:41,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

The market was higher and lower on Friday, but when all was said and done, it essentially ended the day flat. The S&P 500 finished last week's action essentially flat, gaining a tiny 0.06% … the usual modest action we see before a three-day weekend, on the usual modest volume.

General Electric (NYSE: GE ) may have been the ultimate reason stocks finished the week on a (barely) high note. It gained 1.8% on Friday, rallying on a partial legal victory that should ease its vulnerability to a lawsuit that alleges accounting fraud. The suit now must prove there was forehand knowledge of accounting problems that have become nightmarish for the organization and its shareholders.

And, the market managed to overcome the drag that Chesapeake Energy (NYSE: CHK ) proved to be on Friday, when it slumped more than 6%. There was no news, but a major selloff in crude oil and natural gas tripped up most names in the industry.

As the new, shortened trading week gets going though, it's the stock charts of Western Digital (NASDAQ: WDC ), Weyerhaeuser (NYSE: WY ) and Air Products & Chemicals (NYSE: APD ) that deserve the closest looks. Here's why, and what to look for next.

Weyerhaeuser suffered the same rough end to 2018 most other stocks did. But, it hasn't enjoyed the same rebound most other names have mustered so far in 2019. Rather, the stock has seemingly been stuck on a range.

Slowly but surely though, that's changing. While WY stock may remain trapped between support and resistance, it's also starting to find support in places where it hadn't. In the meantime, a handful of momentum indicators have flipped to a bullish mode.

With nothing more than a passing glance, it would be easy to just say Air Products & Chemicals shares are bouncing around, moving sideways after a big runup over the course of the first half of the year. And, perhaps that's all that's happening at this time.

A longer, more detailed examination of the chart since the end of July, however, reveals there may be more going on than it superficially seems. A pullback may be brewing, and the stock's vulnerability could be even more pronounced because of the 44% advance that took shape between January and July.

Finally, the rebound Western Digital stock has been working on since the beginning of this year has really taken hold. It's not yet over a key hump, and has another one to test following that. But, we're starting to see support where we need to see it most, and starting to see momentum indicators solidify in a major way.

Your 30s are arguably the most pivotal decade of your financial life. You're a little older and wiser, and you're (hopefully) earning more money than you were in your 20s. But you still have a lot of years ahead of you and your decisions have far-reaching consequences.

This is great news if you have solid financial goals and a good grasp of how to manage your money responsibly. But if you're guilty of any of the following five money mistakes, now's the time to start making some changes before it's too late.

Debt isn't all bad, but credit card debt definitely is. You get no benefit from it and it becomes expensive very quickly. Some credit cards have APRs over 30%!

If you're only making the minimum payment each month, it can take years to pay off your balance . Credit card debt can also inhibit your ability to save for long-term goals like retirement or a new home.

Paying off credit card debt isn't easy, but it can be done. Here are a few ways to make sure you have the money to pay off your cards:

You'll also want to be smart about making payments.

Pay at least the minimum balance on all of your cards, but throw your extra cash into the card with the highest APR first. When that's paid off, move on to the card with the next-highest APR. Continue from there.

You could also transfer your balance to a card with a 0% introductory APR or take out a personal loan if you want predictable monthly payments.

The average American buys their first home around age 32, according to the National Association of Realtors. In today's material world, the temptation to keep up with the Joneses and buy a luxurious house is hard to ignore. But this can hurt your finances in more ways than one:

If the bulk of your paycheck is going to a mortgage payment, that's less money you can put toward other things. Things like saving for retirement or your kid's college fund. Or taking that trip around the world you've always wanted to go on.

There are many rules of thumb for how much you can afford to spend on a home. Some say 2-2.5 times your annual salary. Others say 30% of your monthly gross income or less.

Ultimately, you have to decide what you can afford. But don't max out your budget just because you can. Look at cheaper houses first to see if you can find something you like at a cost you can comfortably afford.

The Great Recession left many people wary of investing because of the risk of losing money. But many people don't realize that you're virtually guaranteed to lose money if you don't invest.

Inflation slowly erodes the value of the money you have stashed in your savings account . Investing in stocks, bonds, and other assets is one of the best ways to ensure that your money grows over time.

While you should diversify your assets between stocks and bonds at every age, don't invest too conservatively in your 30s. You still have plenty of time before you need to draw upon your savings in retirement. If your assets lose value in the short term, you still have time to make it back.

Enlist the help of a financial advisor if you're unsure how to invest properly. Go with a fee-only advisor instead of an advisor who earns commissions when you make certain investments. And use an online broker that doesn't charge high fees to get the best return on your money.

Once you get married and begin having children, invest in a life insurance policy to protect your family in case you die unexpectedly. No one wants to think about these things happening, but you have to. The alternative is leaving your family to scrape by without enough money to pay the bills if the worst comes to pass.

Compare rates from a few different companies to see which offers the best rates. You can take out a single policy for the primary breadwinner or a policy for both partners. A term life policy is best for most people and typically covers 5-30 years, so you can choose the amount of protection you need.

Do you need that expensive baby gear? Do you put your child's college fund ahead of your retirement savings? Overspending on your children can come back to hurt you -- and them -- in the long run.

Spending too much on your children now can leave you with less money to save for your future. If you run out of money later in life, your children will bear the burden of supporting you. This could easily cost them tens -- if not hundreds -- of thousands of dollars. That hurts their ability to save for their future.

It's great if you can provide for your child's college and your own future at the same time, but place your own financial security first.

Avoiding these five financial mistakes in your 30s can help make your 40s, 50s, and beyond much easier. If you're guilty of any of these bad habits, take steps to correct them today.

This may be the perfect cash back card ! That's because it packs in $1,148 of value. Cardholders can earn up to 5% cash back, double rewards in the first year, and avoid interest well into 2020. With such a deep bench of perks you'll wonder how this card packs in a $0 annual fee. Best yet, you can apply and get a decision in two minutes. Learn more with our in-depth review.

2019-09-03 13:47:58,"Legendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.    In trading on Tuesday, shares of Tapestry Inc (Symbol: TPR) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 29.95, after changing hands as low as $20.34 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF ( SPY  ) is 48.1. A bullish investor could look at TPR's 29.95 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. The chart below shows the one year performance of TPR shares:     Looking at the chart above, TPR's low point in its 52 week range is $18.5356 per share, with $51.29 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $20.26.  makeArticleAd();   Find out what 9 other oversold stocks you need to   know about »

2019-09-03 10:55:17,"Investors in Plains All American Pipeline LP (Symbol: PAA) saw new options begin trading today, for the October 11th expiration. At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the PAA options chain for the new October 11th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.

Because the $21.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.62% return on the cash commitment, or 25.16% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost .

Considering the fact that the $21.50 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 55%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.59% boost of extra return to the investor, or 24.85% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost .

2019-09-03 14:01:00,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Fall means football. It hopefully means cooler weather. It also means a new TV season. While we once waited breathlessly for the latest from CBS (NYSE: CBS ),  Disney's (NYSE: DIS ) ABC or Comcast's (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) NBC, we're now more likely to focus on what's coming from Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) YouTube and Amazon's  (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Prime.

The season has already begun  as Amazon begins streaming Carnival Row . This is either a gritty version of Sherlock Holmes meets Tinker Bell , another liberal bashing of immigration laws  or Orlando Bloom's big comeback.

Maybe it's all three.

Carnival Row also proves that AMZN is not only a TV network, but a big Hollywood studio and the new home for executive intrigue.

While first launched as an add-on to free shipping, Amazon's Prime Video is becoming a key stand-alone business for the company. As the cost of building clouds drops, and more companies build their own, Cloud Czars like Amazon face the challenge of filling their clouds with must-have services.

Amazon's Prime efforts, including its free IMDb service, which it's turning into something more like cable , are having their effect. Amazon is even gaining traction against Netflix in the race for America's attention.

Amazon is pressing its advantage.

Amazon stepped up when Disney offered its Yes Network , which televises sports teams, including the New York Yankees. Amazon is buying exclusive content at film festivals  and burying the hatchet with Google. It's offering programming deals on its streaming stick to take share from Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU ).

Video works for Amazon because, unlike all its competitors, it is its own advertiser. Consumers watch Amazon lingerie shows , or concerts, then stay to buy clothes or back to school items.

Competitors like Disney clearly see that Amazon can monetize its content like no one else.

With its Fire Stick, Fire TV and Prime Video, Amazon has bypassed all the old gatekeepers of media and commerce. It's a platform. It's a host of programming services riding that platform. As in the case of the Taylor Swift concert, it's the store these services advertise. It's an ecosystem unique in the history of business.

That may be why Disney+ won't launch on the Amazon Fire Stick , although it's launching on every other streaming platform. It's not a technology issue.  It's a deliberate business choice , one that could help Roku and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) take share in the platform derby.

That may also be why the sabbatical of Amazon executive vice president Jeff Blackburn is being covered like a Hollywood scandal. Not that AMZN hasn't had its share of Hollywood scandals, including a me-too scandal that took down its head of content two years ago.

But none of this may matter. Amazon is the platform that re-sells its competitors services. Amazon Prime is not just a streaming product, but a whole host of channels. Amazon can enter into, and even dominate, the European market at no incremental cost. Amazon is the advertiser that makes money from advertising.

While Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A , NYSE: BRK.B ) has been lightening up on stocks this year, it has been increasing its purchases of Amazon. So have hedge funds like William Ackman's Pershing Square. So have I.

This is happening despite two failures to hold the $2,000 per share level, or the $1 trillion valuation Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) flew past without looking back at early this year. Amazon now trades at 13% less than it did a year ago, and it pays no dividend .

Yet at its opening price of $1,772 per share, Amazon stock remains a great bargain for any investor with a five-year time horizon. Video is one reason why.

2019-09-03 08:28:00,"JOHANNESBURG, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Ltd  said on Tuesday its debt as of June 30 had fallen below 40 billion rand ($2.63 billion) and that levels were safely below a covenant threshold, sending shares in the South African drugmaker up more than 9%.

The firm, which has a market value of 35 billion rand, built up debt as it shifted from being a mainly generics business in a few countries into a multinational with specialist therapies, including for thrombosis.

Aspen's debt stood at 53.5 billion rand at the end of 2018, more than six times than in 2013, when it went on an acquisition spree, snapping up blood-clot treatment brands, a manufacturing plant from GlaxoSmithKline  and the rights to anaesthetics from AstraZeneca .

Its shares have tumbled nearly 70% since September 2018, when the company said it was selling its infant formula business.

The leverage ratio, which assesses the ability of a firm to meet its financial obligations, is expected to end between 3.60x and 3.70x against a covenant threshold of 4.0x, it said in a trading statement.

Aspen shares jumped nearly 14% after its trading statement to a level last seen on Aug.5, before paring gains to trade 9.68% firmer at 84.27 rand as of 1339 GMT.

Aspen, which operates in Europe, said reported revenue for the year ended June 30 would either be flat or rise 2%, while on constant exchange rates revenue is expected to be flat or decline by 3% when it reports its annual results on Sept. 11.

The largest pharmaceutical company in Africa said it performed a rigorous impairment testing of tangible and intangible asset values once again, resulting in total impairments of 3 billion rand.

""Contributing factors to these impairments are expected pressure on the oncology portfolio in Europe and the restructuring of certain production facilities to align these with production process improvements and expected future manufacturing requirements,"" it said.

Normalised headline earnings per share from continuing operations is seen falling between 5% and 9% from a restated 1,518.5 cents.

2019-09-03 11:32:53,"Investors in Mondelez International Inc (Symbol: MDLZ) saw new options begin trading today, for the October 11th expiration. At Stock Options Channel  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MDLZ options chain for the new October 11th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.    The put contract at the $54.00 strike price has a current bid of 96 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $54.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $53.04 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MDLZ, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $55.13/share today. Because the $54.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 66%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.78% return on the cash commitment, or 17.08% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost  .  makeArticleAd();  Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Mondelez International Inc, and highlighting in green where the $54.00 strike is located relative to that history:       Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $56.00 strike price has a current bid of 84 cents. If an investor was to purchase shares of MDLZ stock at the current price level of $55.13/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $56.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 3.10% if the stock gets called away at the October 11th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MDLZ shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Mondelez International Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MDLZ's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $56.00 strike highlighted in red:    Considering the fact that the $56.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

On our website under the contract detail page for this contract  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.52% boost of extra return to the investor, or 14.64% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost  .    The implied volatility in the put contract example is 22%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 18%.    Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $55.13) to be 17%.

2019-09-03 15:25:04,"Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel  , in trading on Tuesday, shares of Kosmos Energy Ltd (Symbol: KOS) were yielding above the 3% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $0.1808), with the stock changing hands as low as $5.99 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the iShares Russell 3000 ETF ( IWV  ) back on 5/31/2000 - you would have paid $78.27 per share. Fast forward to 5/31/2012 and each share was worth $77.79 on that date, a loss of $0.48 or 0.6% decrease over twelve years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $10.77 per share in dividends over the same period, increasing your return to 13.15%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.0%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Kosmos Energy Ltd (Symbol: KOS) is a member of the Russell 3000, giving it special status as one of the largest 3000 companies on the U.S. stock markets.      In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Kosmos Energy Ltd , looking at the history chart for KOS below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3% annual yield.   makeArticleAd();   Click here to find out which 9 other dividend   stocks just recently went on sale »

2019-09-03 07:25:00," Net profit margin is the most effective parameter to measure a company's profits. A proper analysis of the same shows how well a company is run and the headwinds confronting it. A higher net margin reflects the company's efficiency at converting sales to actual profits.  Net Profit Margin  = Net profit  / Sales  * 100. In simple terms, net profit is the amount a company retains after deducting all costs, interest, depreciation, taxes and other expenses. In fact, net profit margin can turn out to be a potent point of reference to gauge the strength in a company operations and cost-control measures. Also, higher net profit is essential for rewarding stakeholders. Further, strength in the metric not only attracts investors but also draws well-skilled employees that eventually add to the value of the business. Moreover, a higher net profit margin compared to its peers gives the company a competitive edge.  Pros and Cons  Net profit margin helps investors gain clarity on a company's business model in terms of pricing policy, cost structure and manufacturing efficiency. Hence, a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors. However, net profit margin as an investment criterion has its own share of pitfalls. The metric varies widely from industry to industry. While net income is a key metric for investment measurement in traditional industries, it is not that important for technology companies. Moreover, the difference in accounting treatment of various items - especially non-cash expenses like depreciation and stock-based compensation - makes comparison a daunting task. Further, for companies preferring to grow with debt instead of equity funding, higher interest expenses usually weigh on net profit. In such cases, the measure is rendered ineffective while analyzing a company's performance.  The Winning Strategy  A healthy net profit margin and solid EPS growth are the two most sought-after elements in a business model.

Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other.

Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Signet shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Signet is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Retail - Jewelry industry that ranks in the Top 44% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 28 cents per share to 26 cents per share in that period. Given the way analysts feel about Signet right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there's a trade developing.

At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the EWZ options chain for the new October 11th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.

Because the $40.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 54%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.77% return on the cash commitment, or 36.26% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost .

Considering the fact that the $40.50 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 51%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.76% boost of extra return to the investor, or 36.07% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost .

2019-09-03 09:06:00,"Job openings in August climbed by 3.2% year over year to 5.94 million, according to Glassdoor's latest Job Market Report . That's just below July's all-time high of 6 million openings listed on the jobs website.

With so many companies needing to fill open positions, pay rates  last month also rose by 1.9% to a median rate of $53,950 a year. ""That's in line with the rate of growth seen over the last three months, but is still below the 2.6% average pay growth we saw in the second half of 2018,"" wrote Glassdoor's Daniel Zhao in a press release. ""Pay growth has been stubbornly low in 2019, and we don't yet see any signs of faster acceleration consistent with full employment.""

Job openings are nearing record levels. Image source: Getty Images.

Boston had the fastest rate of job growth at 8.5%, driven by the diversity of industries within the city.

San Francisco had the highest rate of pay growth at 3.2%, continuing a 13-month streak. But job openings in the city actually fell by 0.1% ""driven partially by a pullback in hiring in the tech industry, but the decline was also seen across many industries in the local economy,"" according to Glassdoor. Here are the job openings and pay across 10 major metropolitan areas.

Data source: Glasssdoor. YOY = year over year.

Even though there are some fears of a recession, American consumer sentiment remains near generational highs. That has driven hiring in service industries as well as beauty and fitness, ""a smaller industry that relies heavily on consumer spending,"" Zhao noted.

Data source: Glassdoor.

While the demand for workers has been strong, pay growth has not climbed to reflect that. Some fields, however, have done better than others, with a shortage of workers causing companies to be willing to pay more to fill openings.

Data source: Glassdoor.

It's worth noting that except for field engineer and truck driver, all the jobs with the fastest rates of wage growth pay below the $53,950 median for all jobs. That suggests that employers are having a hard time filling lower-paying jobs, forcing them to raise wages.

If openings continue to climb, wages should rise at least in fields where a lack of employees will hit a company's bottom line. That hasn't happened across the board yet, as companies have been slow to raise wages. But at some point -- as we see on the list above -- the need to fill positions should make companies pay more for at least some jobs.

2019-09-03 15:30:00," What's the first rule of successful real estate investing? Of   course, you just said to yourself, ""location, location,   location."" Well, when it comes successful equity trading, the   first rule that should come to your mind is ""price, price,   price."" More specifically, it is the share price performance of a   stock or ETF relative to other stocks and ETFs traded in the   market that is the most important metric to put in your   favor. If a security you are looking to buy has a proven track record   of outperforming others in the broad market, or within its   specific industry group, then that tells you others on Wall   Street think there is something special about it that makes it   worth buying. This ""something special"" could be a variety of things,   including a proven track record of strong revenue and earnings   growth, e.g., Walt Disney (NYSE:      DIS    ); a breakout product or game-changing service, e.g., Netflix   (Nasdaq:      NFLX    ); or a high-demand personal technology product, e.g., Apple   (Nasdaq:      AAPL    ). Whatever the reason, or combination of reasons, the price   performance relative to the rest of the market will tell you more   about what the market thinks about that security than any other   fundamental ratio or so-called ""valuation"" metric you will ever   use. The chief way to assess share price performance relative to   the rest of the market is an indicator called   relative strength (   RS    )    . This indicator assigns a numerical score to a stock based on   its price performance relative to other stocks in the market. The RS rank gives you a great sense of how strong a stock has   performed compared to the rest of the market. And though past   performance isn't a guarantee of future results, a stock or ETF   with a strong RS rank is far more likely to continue   outperforming the rest of the market than those with a low RS   rank. So, what is a ""strong"" RS rank? RS ranges from 0 (weakest) to   100 (strongest). When I look for stocks to trade, I want to see a   RS rank of at least 70, meaning it has outperformed 70% of all   other stocks in the market over the past six months. The 70 threshold here is the minimum level, and the reason why   is because with so many stocks to choose from, why try to pick   one that hasn't shown market-beating performance? Think of it like trying to bet on professional sports. When   you are looking to pick winning teams, do you look at the teams   with losing records first and hope they pull off an upset? Or, do   you look at teams with winning track records and bet on those to   win based on their relatively better records? Any successful sports gambler will tell you the odds of   success are greater when you bet on teams with a winning record.   Sure, you may be the victim of a big upset occasionally, but most   of the time betting on the team with the better record   (particularly over time) will net you the best results. Well,   it's the same for equity trading, and in this sport, RS is the   way to keep track of a winning record in the markets. Now, over the past several decades, there have been numerous   academic studies demonstrating the importance of relative   strength when it comes to successful stock selection. The latest   study is the work of Prof. Eugene F. Fama at the University of   Chicago. In his Nobel Prize-winning research, Fama showed that   relative strength was one of the three factors identified as the   biggest drivers of stock prices. Before Prof. Fama, there was James P. O'Shaughnessy, who   studied 46 years of market history and concluded that stocks with   high relative strength significantly outperformed the overall   stock market. Other high-profile research advocating for the use of relative   strength includes market luminaries such as   Investor's Business Daily    chairman and founder William O'Neil, famed investor Jesse   Livermore, and market pros H.M. Gartley and Robert Levy. For traders looking to identify winning stocks, the most   important thing is price, price, price. Once you've put that   factor on your side via a strong RS rank, the rest of your   undertaking becomes a whole lot easier.

Streaming news for Tuesday includes a deal that has Eros Now stock on the rise.

Eros International (NYSE: EROS ) has signed a deal with OnePlus that will have its content appearing on OnePlus TV in India. The company does not reveal the financial details of the deal that brings Eros Now content to OnePlus TV.

What this means for customers is that they now have easy access to content from Eros Now. They will be able to use the interface found on OnePlus TV sets to search through a catalog of films and shows from Eros Now. It will also allow OnePlus TV customers to view the content in HD and 4K. This does require a TV with these resolutions.

The streaming news comes as Eros International looks to break into the over the internet (OTT) avenue of content delivery. This has been growing more lately as customers continue to cut cords and skip out on traditional methods, such as cable and satellite.

""Today we are at a cusp of a revolution in India and are excited to partner with Eros Now for our upcoming OnePlus TV,"" Vikas Agarwal, General Manager for OnePlus India, says in a statement . ""We envisage this as a forward-thinking partnership which will emerge as the next big deal amidst the entertainment and advanced tech and telecom industry.""

EROS stock was up 7% as of Tuesday afternoon. However, the stock is down 79% since the start of the year.

As of this writing, William White did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-03 10:10:00,"Investing in technology stocks can be an excellent way for long-term investors to experience significant gains in their portfolios. Over the past decade, the Nasdaq 100 index, which is made up mostly of tech stocks , has gained 313%, while the S&P 500 index has increased by 163%.

But selecting the right tech stock isn't always easy, which is why we asked three Motley Fool contributors for their top tech stocks to buy right now. Here's why they suggested Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) , Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) , and PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) .

Image source: Getty Images.

Anders Bylund (Micron Technology): Analysts and investors alike have started to acknowledge that Micron's cyclical turnaround is happening. It's not too late to jump on this skyrocket before the real meat of this up-cycle comes in.

Micron's stock peaked almost exactly one year ago at $64.66 per share. By Christmas share prices had plunged all the way to $28.39 -- a 56% drop in four months. Memory chip prices were falling after a couple of years with stable street prices, and pundits argued that another lengthy price war was coming.

The price war never materialized. Micron and a mere handful of memory chip peers scaled back their production lines instead of flooding the market with cheap products. DRAM and NAND chip prices still fell, but not by the torrential percentage rates seen in the price wars of 2008 and 2015 .

Here in the summer of 2019, memory prices have stabilized to rates near the industry's overarching long-term trends. Micron's sliding revenue chart should turn upward in the second half of this calendar year, driven by stronger demand for both DRAM and NAND chips. In turn, those end markets are heading into secular upswings of their own. Smartphone sales could kick-start their stalled engines as consumers look for new handsets with support for the faster 5G wireless networking standards, and the NAND market continues to explore rising demand from enterprise and data center storage customers.

Meanwhile, Micron shares trade at bargain-bin valuation ratios such as 5.4 times trailing earnings and 8.5 times free cash flows. Skeptics still expect the memory market to melt down in a series of uncontrollable price wars, but that's just not how this maturing market works anymore. And Micron's shares are left undervalued until further notice. This would be a great time to pick up some Micron shares.

Rich Duprey(Roku): Investing in a stock that has rocketed 400% higher in just eight months requires a leap of faith for most investors, but Roku may be the company to convert the masses.

No one is getting more out of the revolution in how video is consumed than Roku. What started as a simple hardware manufacturer of boxes to help viewers watch streaming content has since evolved into a sprawling service for content providers and advertisers. Physical devices are still part of the mix, but merely to provide a gateway for the platform side of its business.

Despite the heights it's already hit, there's no reason to think Roku can't do more. That's because its platform is ""agnostic"" to the content offered, welcoming thousands of stream apps into its home. As viewers flock to its service to consume content, finding it easy to locate and watch shows, providers are following en masse. That's also why it's becoming the platform of choice for smart TV manufacturers: Roku says one out of every three smart TVs sold in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2019 featured Roku TV.

Revenue surged 59% in the second quarter as the number of active accounts jumped to 30.5 million and the number of hours watched expanded to 9.4 billion. Adjusted gross profits expanded to a mouthwatering 66%, indicating the business is scalable and the end hasn't yet been achieved.

No investment can go up forever, but that could have been said of Roku at numerous points along its meteoric journey so far. Because there is no impediment to the streaming video platform's continued rise, it may be a more difficult and risky decision to bet against Roku than to back its continued ascent.

Chris Neiger (PayPal): There's a quiet shift happening right now, and if you're not paying attention, you might miss it. It's the transition from cash to cashless payments. The change has been happening for years, but with the proliferation of the Internet and smartphones it's beginning to accelerate -- and PayPal is already benefiting.

The company is one of the leading online payment platforms, a great position to be in considering that online retail sales will grow from just 11% of all U.S. retail sales right now to 14% by 2021. Online sales are helping to boost PayPal's total payment volume (TPV) -- the total amount spent on the company's platform -- which increased 24% year over year in the second quarter to $172 billion.

But the company is also benefiting as more people use their smartphones to pay for items and to pay each other. PayPal's popular Venmo app, which allows users to pay their peers money or to buy things at merchant stores, processed $24 billion of TPV in the second quarter, an increase of 70% from the year-ago quarter.

Investors looking for a top tech stock that's betting big on the transition to a cashless society would be wise to take a look at PayPal. PayPal's CEO believes that digital payments -- including mobile, peer-to-peer, and online payments -- could eventually reach $100 trillion. And with PayPal already benefiting from this market, the company looks like a great long-term tech investment .

2019-09-03 12:23:00,"This morning, without warning -- and without any news relating to the company specifically, it seems -- shares of satellite communications company Intelsat (NYSE: I) abruptly plunged 16%.

The stock has since recovered somewhat, and as of 11:40 a.m. EDT, it's trading down ""only"" 7%. But that still leaves investors scratching their heads: Why did Intelsat stock fall in the first place?

One guess: SpaceX.

Image source: Getty Images.

Four months ago, Elon Musk's SpaceX made headlines when it launched 60 of its new ""Starlink"" broadband internet satellites into orbit aboard one of its Falcon 9 reusable rockets. And over the Labor Day weekend, some new news broke: Judging from recent filings with the Federal Communications Commission, it appears that SpaceX is planning to launch as many as four more Starlink missions over the next four months.

SpaceX eclipsed the size of Intelsat's 50-satellite constellation in one fell swoop in May. By the end of the year, it could have 300 satellites in orbit, which could be six times as many as Intelsat has. (Admittedly, Intelsat's sats are bigger, more complex, and offer wider coverage because they're in geostationary orbit and not in low Earth orbit -- but still, that's a lot of sats).

And with SpaceX using its own rockets to launch -- its own reusable rockets, which it's already built and only needs to pay for the fuel to launch them -- SpaceX's cost of deploying these satellites can only be a fraction of what Intelsat has to pay to expand its network.

In contrast, when Intelsat was building its own satellite constellation, it had to hire -- and pay -- SpaceX to launch them. Partly as a result, Intelsat is nearly $15 billion in debt, further hampering its ability to compete. While I can't say for certain that this is the scenario that has Intelsat investors spooked this morning, I'd say it's a pretty fair guess -- and maybe it's not only Intelsat investors who should be worried.

2019-09-03 10:46:00," As of late, it has definitely been a great time to be an investor in Caleres, Inc. CAL  . The stock has moved higher by 21.2% in the past month, while it is also above its 20 Day SMA too. This combination of strong price performance and favorable technical, could suggest that the stock may be on the right path.

2019-09-03 12:49:00,"MONTREAL, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Air Canada  has challenged Onex Corp's   proposed acquisition of WestJet Airlines , on grounds that the deal may not meet the country's ownership rules, according to a letter sent by the carrier to the Canadian Transportation Agency.

Toronto-based Onex's planned C$3.5 billion ($2.6 billion) buyout of Calgary-based WestJet has received approval from the carrier's shareholders and some regulators, but the agency is still reviewing whether the deal meets Canada's protective ownership laws. 

Under Canadian rules, foreigners cannot own more than 49% equity in a Canadian airline. The rules further restrict a foreign airline and any single foreign owner from controlling more than a quarter of voting interests in a Canadian carrier.

""The uncertainty and flexibility of co-investor

participation introduces significant risk that non-Canadian co-investors will have control-in-fact of WestJet following the transaction,"" Air Canada said.

Air Canada declined to comment on the letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.

The Canadian Transportation Agency said it is aware of the issues raised in Air Canada's letter.

""The process underway will allow the CTA to determine whether the proposed transaction will result in an undertaking that is Canadian,"" the agency said by email.

Onex said in a statement that it ""is engaged with the CTA on the regulatory approval process of our transaction.""

Air Canada also argued that Onex requires at least a quarter of its board to be Canadian, which is below the government's threshold for control.

Under the terms of the deal announced in May, Onex's acquisition of WestJet is set to close later in 2019 or early next year. WestJet shares were down 0.3% at C$30.77 on Tuesday afternoon.

International Business Machines (NASDAQ: IBM ) has been a big, fat dud. Shares of Big Blue are down 8% in the past year, 15% in the past three years and 30% over the past five years. The performance of IBM stock is a major drag compared to big tech and the stock market overall.

Rather than be in IBM as a contrarian play, investors could have sat in consensus picks. For instance, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOG ) have doubled over the past five years. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) has tripled, while Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is up five-fold.

IBM may have had Buffett along for the ride for a while, but other than that, it severely lacked any positive catalysts. More than five straight years of quarterly revenue declines say as much. However, are the long-term charts starting to turn more bullish on International Business Machines stock?

Some may say yes. Let's take a look.


 Click to Enlarge

Above is a long-term weekly chart of the IBM stock price. One can see that, short of a few spikes and plunges, IBM has mostly gone nowhere over the past few years. In fact, it has trickled lower, as a series of lower highs has pressured the share price.

However, while that downtrend line is technically still in place because IBM is below it, note that the stock did push above it earlier this year. Only once the volatility in August picked up did IBM stock fall back below it.

The preceding price action is important though because IBM made a higher low from its May/June lows. That also came amid intensifying trade talks, just as the August spill did.

Now though, IBM stock price is putting together an uptrend, as well as holding its 50-week moving average. Coiling just below its 200-week moving average, the stock is pressing above it in Friday's trading session.


 Click to Enlarge

In the short-term, a move to $139 could be in the cards. That's where IBM stock will find its 50-day moving average, as shown on the daily chart above. Over that mark puts IBM above its major moving averages, both daily and weekly, as well as weekly downtrend resistance.

That opens the door to its 2019 highs near $151. Also worth mentioning is that while IBM stock has struggled over the past 12 months, it's actually up 19.5% so far on the year. That's not all that far from the 22% gain the PowerShares QQQ ETF (NASDAQ: QQQ ) has logged so far in 2019.

So perhaps IBM stock has a bit more momentum than investors tend to give it credit for.

The problem with International Business Machines stock has not been the valuation. Instead, it's been growth.

While Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet continue to generate a huge presence in the cloud, IBM has been relatively quiet. That's not to say it has no presence in the cloud space (because it most certainly does). But it missed a huge opportunity to emulate what has become key growth pillars for top mega-cap tech stocks.

Acquiring Red Hat does help, but it came at a price of $34 billion. That's not a cheap figure and one could argue that for such a price, IBM could have acquired other companies with better growth. Remember, IBM has a market cap of ""just"" $120 billion.

Either way, growth is still hurting. Analysts forecast a 2.1% decline in revenue for 2019. This goes alongside estimates calling for a 7.1% dip in earnings to $12.81 per share. Should IBM report in-line results, it leaves shares trading at about 10.5 times current earnings. At that price, it's not exactly expensive, particularly with a ~5% dividend yield to boot .

If the technicals start to work out and if IBM can actually deliver, the stock could be setting up for a long-awaited rally .

Estimates call for revenue to grow a whopping 4.1% next year and for earnings to explode higher by 4.8%. All jest aside, a return to mid-single-digit growth, a strong dividend and low valuation could certainly attract buyers. Let's see if the charts will confirm the change in sentiment going forward.

Leading the Apple  (NASDAQ: AAPL ) rumor mill today is news of how the iPhone 11 performs. Today, we'll look at that and other Apple Rumors for Tuesday.

iPhone 11 Scores : A new Geekbench score may give us a look at the iPhone 11's specs , reports BGR . The scores on Geekbench appear to be for the successor to the iPhone XR. These scores have this new device getting 5415 in the single-core test and 11294 for the multi-core score. The device is also sporting a 6-core 2.66GHz A13 processor and has 4GB of RAM. With the newest line of iPhone devices likely coming out later this month, these scores could be legitimate.

AR Glasses : Apple may still be working on its AR glasses , MacRumors notes. A recent look inside the code for iOS 13 shows several mentions to such a device. Among these is a ""STARTester"" app, which has the ability to switch to a head-mounted position. Other lines of code also make reference to what could be AR modes for other apps. Some rumors claim that AAPL is no longer working on AR glasses, but others say they may come out as early as 2020.

Watch Patent : A new Apple Watch patent may give us a look at future bands , reports 9to5Mac . The patent describes a new type of Watch band that would be able to unlock the device for the person. It may be able to do this thanks to a sensor on the band that sits where the wrist goes. Think of it as a version of Touch ID for the wrist. Once in contact with the owner, it can unlock the device.

Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2019 and Full-Year Results Conference   Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A   brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal   presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Patrick   McKillop, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may   begin.  Patrick McKillop    --   Director of Investor Relations  Thank you. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us for   today's conference call to discuss our financial results for our   fiscal fourth quarter 2019 and fiscal year 2019. By now, all of   you should have had the opportunity to review the press release   discussing the results. If you have not, a copy of the release is   available in the Investor Relations sections of our website   www.napcosecurity.com. On the call today is Richard Soloway,   President and CEO of NAPCO Security Technologies; and Kevin   Buchel, Senior Vice President and CFO. Before we begin, let me take a moment to read the   forward-looking statement. This conference call may contain   forward-looking statements that involve numerous risks and   uncertainties. Actual results, performance or achievements may   differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking   statements as a result of certain factors, including those set   forth in the Company's filings with the SEC. During the call, we may also present certain Non-GAAP   financial measures, such as adjusted EBITDA and certain ratios   that are used with these measures. In the press release and on   the financial tables issued earlier today, you'll find the   definition of these non-GAAP financial measures, a reconciliation   of these non-GAAP financial measures with the closest GAAP   financial measure, as well as a discussion about why we think   these non-GAAP financial measures are relevant to our results.   These financial measures are included for the benefit of   investors and should not be considered instead of GAAP   measures. I will turn the call over to Dick in a moment, but before I   do, I just want to mention a few things on the IR front. In terms   of upcoming investor outreach, we will be attending and hosting a   one-on-one meeting at the Lake Street Big3 conference on   September 12th in New York and also at the CL King Conference in   New York on September 19th. Investor outreach is crucial   especially for small cap companies such as NAPCO. And I would   like to thank all of those folks that assist us in these   conferences and marketing trips. With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to Richard   Soloway, President and CEO of NAPCO Security Technologies. Dick,   the floor is yours.  Richard L. Soloway    --   President and Chief Executive Officer  Thank you, Patrick. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our   conference call. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our   results. The fourth quarter and fiscal year 2019 marked another   record revenue and profitability performance for NAPCO. Our SaaS   recurring revenues continued to grow at a rapid rate. Our   recurring revenues annual run rate is now $20.4 million as of   June. Our focus on targeting the professional installations and   mostly commercial end market is driving this continuous   growth. Our balance sheet remains strong with zero debt as of this   report, and our cash balances continue to grow. Capitalizing on   key industry trends, including school security solution, wireless   fire and intrusion alarm communicators, enterprise access control   system and architectural locking products remains our focus. The   management team here at NAPCO continues to focus on the key   metrics of growth, profit and return on equity. These metrics are   important for us as well as our shareholders. Our business   strategy is to executing well and our interests are aligned with   our shareholders as senior management at NAPCO owns 38% of the   equity. Before I go into greater detail, I'll now turn the call over   to our CFO, Kevin Buchel. He will provide an overview of our   fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year financial results, and then   I'll be back with more on our strategies and outlook. Kevin?  Kevin S. Buchel    --   Senior Vice President of Operations and Finance and Chief   Financial Officer  Thank you, Dick, and good morning, everybody. For the fourth   quarter, net sales increased 9% to $29.6 million, which was a   record quarterly performance and the 20th consecutive quarter of   year-over-year record sales, as compared to $27.3 million for the   same period a year ago. For fiscal 2019, net sales increased 12%   to a record $102.9 million, as compared with $91.7 million a year   ago. The increase in sales for the quarter were primarily related   to increased sales of our alarm communication services,   door-locking products and access control products. For the full   fiscal year, the increase in sales was primarily related to   increased sales from alarm communication services and products,   door-locking products and access control products. Recurring   monthly revenue from the alarm division increased 44% for the   quarter and 45% for the fiscal year. Recurring revenue now has an   annual run rate of $20.4 million based on June 2019 recurring   revenue. Gross profit for the fourth quarter increased 7% to $12.9   million with a gross margin of 44%, as compared to $12.1 million   with a gross margin of 45% last year. Gross profit for fiscal   year 2019 increased 16% to $43.9 million with a gross margin of   43%, as compared to $38 million with a gross margin of 41% last   year. The increase in gross profit for the fourth quarter and the   fiscal year was primarily due to the increase in sales as   partially offset by increased salary and freight expenses. The slight decrease in gross margin in the fourth quarter was   primarily due to product mix, as well as additional sales   discounts given related to several new product launches. The   increase in gross margin for the fiscal year was primarily due to   the 45% increase in recurring revenue, where the gross margin was   78%, as well as the leverage from the Dominican Republic   manufacturing facility generated from equipment revenue increases   of 7%. Also, please note that the tariff situation with China has   no effect on our margins as we manufacture virtually 100% in the   Dominican Republic. Even when we get raw materials from China,   they're shipped directly to the DR, so no tariffs. Our   competition is not as fortunate. They have tariff issues on both   finished and raw material. R&D expenses for the fourth quarter increased 8% to $1.9   million or 6% of sales compared to $1.7 million or 6% of sales   last year. For the fiscal year, R&D expenses increased 9% to   $7.2 million or 7% of sales as compared to $6.6 million or 7% of   sales last year. The increase for the three months and the full   year was primarily due to additional personnel. SG&A expenses for Q4 increased 3% year-over-year to $6.3   million or 21% of sales as compared to $6.1 million or 23% of   sales last year. For the fiscal 2019, SG&A expenses increased   1% to $23.2 million or 23% of sales as compared to $23 million or   25% of sales last year. The increases in dollars was primarily   from increases in employee compensation. The decrease as a   percentage of sales was primarily the result of the percentage   increase of sales exceeding the increase in selling, general and   administrative expense. Operating income for the fourth quarter increased 11% to $4.8   million as compared to $4.3 million last year. For the fiscal   year, operating income increased 60% to $13.5 million compared to   $8.4 million last year. Income tax expense for the quarter decreased by $531,000 to   $35,000, as compared to $566,000 last year. Income tax expense   for fiscal 2019 increased $538,000 to $1.2 million as compared to   $684,000 for the same period a year ago. The decrease in income   tax expense for the fourth quarter was primarily due to the   recognition of increased R&D tax credit. The increase in   income tax expense for the fiscal year was primarily due to the   aforementioned increase in operating income. The Company's   effective tax rate remained relatively constant at 9% for fiscal   2019 as compared to 8% for fiscal 2018. Net income for the fourth quarter increased 28% to a fourth   quarter record of $4.7 million, which equates to 16% of net sales   or $0.26 per diluted share as compared to $3.7 million or $0.20   per diluted share last year. For the year, net income increased   60% to a record $12.2 million, which equates to 12% of net sales   or $0.66 per diluted share, as compared to $7.6 million or $0.41   per diluted share for the same period a year ago. The change in   net income for the quarter and the year ended June 30, 2019, was   primarily due to the items previously mentioned. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, as outlined in the schedule   included in today's press release, increased 10% to $5.2 million,   which equates to 17% of net sales or $0.28 per diluted share   compared to $4.7 million or $0.25 per diluted share last year.   For the year, adjusted EBITDA increased 51% to $15 million, which   equates to 15% of net sales or $0.81 per diluted share as   compared to $10 million or $0.53 for diluted share last year. Moving on to the balance sheet. The cash balance at June 30,   2019, was $8 million as compared to $5.3 million at June 30,   2018. Our working capital as of June 30, 2019 was $51.1 million   as compared to $44.3 million at June 30, 2018. Current ratio is   4.6:1 at June 30, 2019 as compared with 5.7:1 at June 30, 2018.   And debt remained at zero at June 30, 2019. Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was   $2.9 million[Phonetic] and for the full fiscal year was $8.7   million. Inventory levels remain higher than normal as we are   gearing up for several new product launches, including iSecure,   our new Marks' anti-ligature lock, and our new line of AT&T   LTE StarLink Radio, all of which, I think, we'll cover   momentarily. Capex was $388,000 during the quarter and was 1.9 --   $1,988,000 for the year. That concludes my formal remarks, and I would now like to   return the call back to Dick.  Richard L. Soloway    --   President and Chief Executive Officer  Kevin, thank you. The growth of our business is strong, and we   believe the trend will continue in the future. Demand for our   recurring revenue product is coming from alarm communications,   including fire, intrusion and the growth of the smart home   category. We continue to believe that the market opportunity for   school security in the United States is significant. There are   approximately 100,000 K-12 and 10,000 colleges and universities   in the US. None of us will ever forget the tragic event that took   place during 2018 and continue to take place this year. We remain   dedicated to providing solutions and products that schools that   desperately need. During our past conference calls, we have discussed an   increased volume of legislation being passed by many states since   2018, which includes funding of $1 billion. According to a US   News & World Report article from earlier this year, states   are considering nearly 250 different school safety builds in   2019. This underscores how the issue remains front and center for   everyone. The federal government, you may recall, in 2018 passed   a grant program which has allocated $100 million dollars per year   through 2028 for school security. We're also aware of other   pending legislation, which we are monitoring. The pipeline for   school security products looks robust. And we will continue to   announce new wins when we can, as we need to receive approval   from the schools prior to doing so. Recently, we have witnessed more and more active shooter   incidences taking place at houses of worship and other public   meeting places. We have seen a need to expand the use of our SAVI   audit system for these location. The continuing violence in   public area is painting a clear picture for the need to secure   these areas with our products, such as wireless locks and access   control. During Q4, we began the launch of our new AT&T LTE   StarLink line of universal fire, intrusion alarm and IoT   communicators. We now have StarLink lines on both Horizon and the   AT&T LTE network, which provides our dealers with the largest   LTE service coverage in the US. Also, we will be launching the   new version of our Marks Division anti-ligature locks. These   locks meet ADA, that's American with Disabilities Act,   requirements as well as the BHMA highest anti-ligature standard.   The shaping and structure of these locksets are designed to   restrict the attachment of lines, laces, etc, to doorknobs and   levers. The locksets are offered in unprecedented, cylindrical,   mortise styles, models and functions and provide easy   installation and retrofit to all popular door constructions. We are very excited about the upcoming launch of our latest   product iSecure. It was debuted at the ISC West Trade Show in Las   Vegas in April of this year. The iSecure is designed for the new   breed of professional installers and savvy consumers. It has   quick installation time, and its advanced features are perfect   for smart home applications so in demand today. The iSecure won   the MVP, that's the Most Valuable Product, Award in the Home   Controls category at the trade show and drew lots of traffic from   dealers into our trade show booth. Lastly, our FireLink Fire Alarm Control Panel with a built-in   cellular communicator was launched earlier this year. FireLink,   an all-in-one 8-32 zone fire alarm panel with built-in cellular   LTE StarLink-powered communicator, has grown quickly in sales.   FireLink comes pre-configured and pre-activated enabling easy   installation and cost savings for dealer. FireLink will add to   our already rapidly growing recovering revenue. We'll begin our Q&A session portion of this call in a   moment. Our fiscal year 2019 was a very successful record-breaking   year for us as we continued to grow the Company and deliver   strong profits. Our shareholders have been rewarded with very   healthy returns and stock performance. NAPCO is in a strong   position to continue its growth in sales and profits going   forward. We are excited about the future fiscal year 2020 and   beyond. NAPCO's senior management maintains a higher level of   ownership in our equity, approximately 38%, and I would like to   thank everyone for their support and for joining us in the   exciting future we have. Our formal remarks are now concluded. We'd like to open the   call for the Q&A session. Operator, please proceed. Questions and Answers:  Operator  Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer   session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from   the line of Jaeson Schmidt with Lake Street Capital. Please   proceed with your question.  Jaeson Schmidt    --   Lake Street Capital -- Analyst  Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I just want to   start with the security market -- school security market. It   seems like you are seeing some really nice traction there. Can   you comment if you're seeing the size of the installed increasing   over the past few months here?  Richard L. Soloway    --   President and Chief Executive Officer  This -- good morning. There are many different types of jobs   that we're getting, and some of them are larger than others, and   we always find that with the jobs that we do, the schools,   especially universities, keep adding to that. So we've done some   schools -- we've gone back four times, keep doing the dorm   buildings and the classrooms and the executive offices. But   they're all different sizes all over the country. If you've seen   the press releases we've put out, they're all starting to come   together where localities want to protect their students, come to   the realization this is not going to stop unless something major   is done in policy within the country, which that looks like that   kind of stymied, I don't know what's going to happen with   that. So the only way around all this is to put in school security.   And our line of school security is the widest school security   line in the industry. And that we make stand-alone, we make   remote control, we make systems where you can have a man trap and   lock an active shooter between doorways. There are different ways   of configuring our systems that we're very flexible. So we expect   that to continue small, medium and large job, and each job   increasing in volume as they add more facilities too them.  Jaeson Schmidt    --   Lake Street Capital -- Analyst  Okay. That's helpful. And along those lines, just given the   increasing correction in that market, do you expect to need to   add to headcount in a significant way to address all the   opportunities?  Richard L. Soloway    --   President and Chief Executive Officer  We have a very nice network of sales agents and reps and in   fact, we've made an integration between the Marks group and the   Alarm Lock group. So we have more sales people, and they are more   intense in their territory. But we don't expect to see an   increase in -- for the new year. In fact, this year the SG&A   was basically flat. We are very budget conscious. We wanted to   make sure we get the most efficiency out of each of our sales   people. As far as the manufacturing side of the business, we're   in the Dominican Republic. Our components are shipped in from all   over Asia, and we do all our assembly there. The minimum wage in   the Dominican Republic is $2,500 a year, so it's not really   material. If you get another 50 workers assembling products, the   margins are great on the product, so that it's not really a   material effect. So we're pretty stable in both of these areas,   both sales, marketing and manufacturing.  Jaeson Schmidt    --   Lake Street Capital -- Analyst  Okay. And the last one for me and I'll jump back into queue. I   know previously you threw out a $40 million recurring revenue run   rate target for fiscal 2021. Do you still feel confident in that   target?  Kevin S. Buchel    --   Senior Vice President of Operations and Finance and Chief   Financial Officer  Not only do I feel confident -- it's Kevin. Not only do I feel   confident, Jaeson, I thought, we would be pushing hard to get to   $20 million -- we got to twenty $20.4 million run rate. $40   million, we could beat it. And I'm just keeping -- I'm still   saying $40 million. But if we had recurring revenue into the   other areas of the business, like we talked about, we try to get   it into the locking side, the access, we'll blow past the $40   million. For now, let's just call it $40 million by June of   2021.  Jaeson Schmidt    --   Lake Street Capital -- Analyst  Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.  Kevin S. Buchel    --   Senior Vice President of Operations and Finance and Chief   Financial Officer  You're welcome, Jaeson.  Richard L. Soloway    --   President and Chief Executive Officer  Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike   Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your   question.  Mike Walkley    --   Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst  Great. Thanks. Great to see the recurring revenue growth and   reiteration of targets. Just a question for me on the hardware   gross margin side. What about -- maybe a little bit closer to 40%   with the $24 million hardware revenue achieved this quarter, can   you talk a little bit about the mix that impacted margins for the   quarter and maybe a little more color on some of the price   discounts that you gave during the quarter?  Kevin S. Buchel    --   Senior Vice President of Operations and Finance and Chief   Financial Officer  One of the[Phonetic] things -- we tried to do by -- is to   capture a lot of the AT&T radio market -- LTE. And we   introduced that in the fourth quarter, and our thought process   was to capture that market, because once we start getting the   recurring revenue, we got that pretty much for life. It is a big   market. We didn't have it. We're starting to get it. I would put   about 2% margin effect in the quarter because of that. So I would   have expected normal situation to be at 40% also. We came in and   basically set 37%. So there is a 3% differential. 2% I would say,   is because of discounts we gave on the new product introduction.   1%, I would say, is due to the mixed -- sometimes there's mix   differences. If we get a big school job at a university in one   quarter and you get a job that's not as big the following year,   that could easily affect it by 1%. Nothing that we saw out of the   ordinary to have a 1% differential on mix. Not that unusual. The   part that was different was the 2% because of discount. Virtually   all due to the AT&T LTE radio intro.  Mike Walkley    --   Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst  Great, thanks. And then maybe just building on that, you   highlighted all kinds of new products ramping in the coming   quarters. How should we think maybe about mix from the new   products? How does that impact gross margin in the short term on   the hardware side? Obviously, growing recurring revenue is great   for the long term, but how should we maybe think about short-term   margins given some of these new products coming into the   model?  Kevin S. Buchel    --   Senior Vice President of Operations and Finance and Chief   Financial Officer  I think, in Q1 you'll see a little more of what we saw in Q4   in the introduction, because the LTE -- that's a big area for us.   You'll see a little more of that. I don't think you'll see any   discounting or we introduce the new anti-lig, that's a very   expensive high margin product to begin with. And everybody wants   to get their hands on the new version. We don't have to do that.   We're like one of the few that manufactured this. The iSecure   that's coming out of the gate very aggressively priced. We don't   have to discount that beyond what it is. People are going to jump   at that, just because the price is so good right out of the gate.   It is going to blow away the competition. So I don't expect any   discounting on that one either. It's really a little bit more on   the radio side, but we believe that the recurring growing   dramatically like it has with 78% to 80% gross margin that -- it   will more than make up for that.  Mike Walkley    --   Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst  Thanks, and last question for me and I'll pass on. Just on the   recurring revenue given your conference, you still think of like   40% plus year-over-year growth rate? Or does it slow in the short   term and accelerate as the new products start to ramp? And then   secondly, just given the ramp at AT&T, any color how it's   going so far, maybe relative to the Verizon launch? Thank   you.  Richard L. Soloway    --   President and Chief Executive Officer  We expect that, the $40 million is the number that we're going   to hit in June 30, 2021[Phonetic] year. We think that with the   AT&T, the iSecure and some of the locking products that are   going to be generating recurring revenue, which is revolutionary   for the business never been done before in the whole industry.   Locks traditionally don't generate recurring revenue. They're a   one-off sale, but our versions of the locks will generate   recurring revenue. The installation companies as well as end   users. We think that we can go beyond the $40 million and we'll   do -- do to get our market share. But I think that the price   point that we've established are going to be pretty stable. And   we're going to hit that number of $40 million and beyond. That's   how we look at it.  Mike Walkley    --   Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst  Thanks. Thank you.  Richard L. Soloway    --   President and Chief Executive Officer  Okay, Mike.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Pfau   with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.  Matt Pfau    --   William Blair -- Analyst  Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask on   hardware growth in the quarter. It's the lowest for the year. And   -- but the full year was about 7%, which is sort of in line with   what you guys have talked about longer term. Was there anything   disappointing in the quarter or one-off in the quarter that had   that growth rate below the other quarters and the year? And how   do we think about that growth rate going forward as the fourth   quarter more indicative of the go forward, or is the full-year   growth more of how we should think about it?  Kevin S. Buchel    --   Senior Vice President of Operations and Finance and Chief   Financial Officer  The hardware growth for the full year of 7% was one of the   highest increases we've had in years. We've been saying our goal   is to get the high single or double digit. So 7%, we're on our   way to high single, I don't think there's any reason for us to   believe why we can't do more better from a percentage point of   view for fiscal 2020. Since we're introducing so many things   between, iSecure, the new anti-lig, the new radios, the FireLink   panel hasn't been out that long. We're doing -- we spend a lot of   money on R&D, for us a lot, hasn't gone up by that much but   $7.2 million this past year? They're spending a lot of time on   doing a lot of things that get us more recurring and more   hardware. The hardware sales is very important to us too. The   Dominican leverage we talked about is very important. Just we   didn't see it as much in Q4, but you saw it for the full year.   And that's a big part of what we're doing. We're getting so busy   down there. We're going to be going to a second shift on radios   soon. These are all good things. So if I was projecting out, I   would still believe that low-single -- I mean, high-single digits   for Q -- for the full year, even though it was lower in Q4 it's   Still a goal and still very achievable.  Matt Pfau    --   William Blair -- Analyst  Got it. And then on the school security side, you mentioned   all these funding bills that are out there and the fees that have   passed. How big of an impact has the government funding been to   the school security business or is that still more of an   opportunity with some of these bills being passed, potentially   accelerating the growth of that business?  Richard L. Soloway    --   President and Chief Executive Officer  We're seeing an increase in school security jobs. We're   publishing them as we get them. There's many, many more queue if   the schools are being -- it they're getting some funding from   their regional area, we expect there's going to be federal   funding, there is going to be legislation put out. So all of this   primes the pump to get a lot more business. And since we have a   offering for K-12, which are low-cost, easy-to-convert K-12 to   more secure places for the student and not that expensive to do.   Schools are jumping the gun and doing their own financing of this   through state legislature and counties around the country. The   college or universities have large endowments. They're using that   money in anticipation of more money coming down. And we're seeing   a better situation in the schools that make these moves, and   they're going to be much more protective for the students. So we see this all in a very positive light. It's going to   take many, many years of growth and the schools will be secure.   But as far as we could see, I could see five years of continuous   school growth ahead of us, and the big money is going to really   come down.  Matt Pfau    --   William Blair -- Analyst  Got it. And in terms of the hurricane that's currently   impacting the Caribbean, any impact there to your operations in   the Dominican? I realized it didn't hit there. But in terms of   getting the goods out of the Dominican to the US, are there any   disruption there from the hurricane?  Richard L. Soloway    --   President and Chief Executive Officer  We haven't -- we -- our factor is Category 5 in the Dominican   Republic. So the hurricane itself didn't hit. There's going to be   -- we ship things both by air and by sea. Though we haven't   gotten feedback yet from the ocean shipping companies. But they   are on top of their game. So we expect with the amount of   inventory we have here that we'll be able to satisfy all demand   and keep things rolling. But let's see how things go in the next   week or so.  Matt Pfau    --   William Blair -- Analyst  Okay. Got it. That's it for me, guys. Thanks a lot.  Richard L. Soloway    --   President and Chief Executive Officer  Thanks, Matt.  Operator  [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line   of Jeff Kessler with Imperial Capital. Please proceed with your   question.  Jeff Kessler    --   Imperial Capital -- Analyst  Thank you. Thank you for taking my question. It's probably   fair to say that there is a little bit of a surprise up on the   analyst part in looking at how much you spent on some of the new   investments that you're making, the AT&T radio capturing that   part of that market? And I'm wondering -- this brings up two   questions. Number 1, do you think that, Number 1, by keeping this   under wraps, at least publicly, not talking about what you were   going to invest in, do you think you've been able to take the   competitive market a little bit by surprise since you've already   been in the Verizon side of the market? You haven't been in the   AT&T market so heavily. Do you think that you again, taken a   little bit of the AT&T folks on the communication side by   surprise? And Number 2, are these investments that you're making now,   where do you see the returns coming? Let's get -- if you want to   call it a little bit earlier and which ones are you going to be   taking a little bit longer to play out over the course of the   next fiscal year and a half?  Richard L. Soloway    --   President and Chief Executive Officer  Jeff, these are complicated questions. It's not an exact   science, but it's always good to sneak up on the competition, and   that's what the AT&T radios are very important launch, and   you hit the nail right on the head. We're going to have   tremendous success with AT&T radios to grow our recurring   revenue. And we had to do we had to do to run run the business in   a very solid way for mid-term and long-term, and that AT&T   radio nationwide makes us very unique of the fact that we're   doing fire with it as well as home and more business. So it's an   important thing to do, and it bodes well for our future. We   expect that between AT&T radios and iSecure and every iSecure   has a radio built into it, so that every alarm that's installed.   Going forward iSecure, which we expect to be a real volume   producer will generate recurring revenue for us. And having it on   all these network is very important. So if you want more detail,   we could do a conversation later on getting in deeper if you want   to go deeper than this.  Jeff Kessler    --   Imperial Capital -- Analyst  Sure. And as far as if you want to -- I don't see a schedule,   but what do you see as -- which are we going to be seeing the   returns from a little bit earlier, which are really seeing the   returns from a little bit later? Are those investments that you   were making over the last quarter and into -- and obviously into   the next quarter?  Richard L. Soloway    --   President and Chief Executive Officer  Our investments are -- we have this goal -- we have of the   goal at June 30, 2021 that we're going to be at $40 million in   recurring and we're going to be a $100 million in hardware   manufacturing. And if you put that together and you are over   $1.30 a share and that is our goal. And we're doing everything we   can to win market share to get to our goal and go beyond our   goal. And it looks like, this is working for us.  Jeff Kessler    --   Imperial Capital -- Analyst  Okay. One final question. One of the real big issues that I'm   dealing with right now and which the industry is -- overall is   dealing with right now to try to -- not just prop up, but to --   just to reinforce the value proposition is the difference between   verified and unverified alarm signals out there? The difference   between convenience and having a professional service, to have   police show up within five or six minutes on the residential   side, not just on the commercial side. What are you folks -- what   are you doing? And I'm thinking about iSecure in companies and   products like that. What are you doing to accelerate the   industry's -- the professional industry's ability to have police   and, of course, the PSAPs, 911[Phonetic] centers, except the   signals more readily and allow police to come in and respond   without having false alarms?  Richard L. Soloway    --   President and Chief Executive Officer  Well, a lot of the false alarms are caused by DIY products,   not professionally installed products. DIY products are not   attached to the walls, to the ceiling that well, they move and   they cause a false alarm or they're not close enough to the   magnetic contacts to go on the windows. So that caused a lot of   false alarms. Our iSecure is not aimed for the DIY market, but   its price point and its functionality is to put the dealer --   professional dealer in the game of installing more and more alarm   systems, which compete against the DIY products. So it's very professionally installed, which eliminate a lot   of the false alarms you're getting DIY. And we're trying to arm   our dealers and the dealers across the nation with a product,   which has a better return on investment, more reliable, more   feature rich and installs with less false alarms. That's our   contribution to what's going on. I   t report    s to all Central Station. It reports daily and it works to our   back-end NOC, which has the ability to give it additional   functionality to eliminate false alarm. And we can talk about   that off line -- since I know that you and the industry and us   were all components of keeping the police respond to real alarms   not false alarms, that's the major thing in the industry. But we   can talk offline and go through exactly what this does from a   [Speech Overlap]  Jeff Kessler    --   Imperial Capital -- Analyst  Great, Richard. Yes, that's great. Okay, thank you very much.   I Appreciate.  Richard L. Soloway    --   President and Chief Executive Officer  Alright.  Operator  Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer   session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Soloway   for any closing remark.  Richard L.

 NAPCO Security Technologies Inc    (NASDAQ: NSSC)        Q4 2019 Earnings Call       Sep 3, 2019 ,   11:00 a.m. ET 

 Operator 

Greetings, and welcome to the NAPCO Security Technologies,   Inc. Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2019 and Full-Year Results Conference   Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A   brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal   presentation. [Operator Instructions]

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Patrick   McKillop, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may   begin.

 Patrick McKillop    --   Director of Investor Relations 

Thank you. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us for   today's conference call to discuss our financial results for our   fiscal fourth quarter 2019 and fiscal year 2019. By now, all of   you should have had the opportunity to review the press release   discussing the results. If you have not, a copy of the release is   available in the Investor Relations sections of our website   www.napcosecurity.com. On the call today is Richard Soloway,   President and CEO of NAPCO Security Technologies; and Kevin   Buchel, Senior Vice President and CFO.

Before we begin, let me take a moment to read the   forward-looking statement. This conference call may contain   forward-looking statements that involve numerous risks and   uncertainties. Actual results, performance or achievements may   differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking   statements as a result of certain factors, including those set   forth in the Company's filings with the SEC.

During the call, we may also present certain Non-GAAP   financial measures, such as adjusted EBITDA and certain ratios   that are used with these measures. In the press release and on   the financial tables issued earlier today, you'll find the   definition of these non-GAAP financial measures, a reconciliation   of these non-GAAP financial measures with the closest GAAP   financial measure, as well as a discussion about why we think   these non-GAAP financial measures are relevant to our results.   These financial measures are included for the benefit of   investors and should not be considered instead of GAAP   measures.

I will turn the call over to Dick in a moment, but before I   do, I just want to mention a few things on the IR front. In terms   of upcoming investor outreach, we will be attending and hosting a   one-on-one meeting at the Lake Street Big3 conference on   September 12th in New York and also at the CL King Conference in   New York on September 19th. Investor outreach is crucial   especially for small cap companies such as NAPCO. And I would   like to thank all of those folks that assist us in these   conferences and marketing trips.

With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to Richard   Soloway, President and CEO of NAPCO Security Technologies. Dick,   the floor is yours.

 Richard L. Soloway    --   President and Chief Executive Officer 

Thank you, Patrick. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our   conference call. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our   results. The fourth quarter and fiscal year 2019 marked another   record revenue and profitability performance for NAPCO. Our SaaS   recurring revenues continued to grow at a rapid rate. Our   recurring revenues annual run rate is now $20.4 million as of   June. Our focus on targeting the professional installations and   mostly commercial end market is driving this continuous   growth.

Our balance sheet remains strong with zero debt as of this   report, and our cash balances continue to grow. Capitalizing on   key industry trends, including school security solution, wireless   fire and intrusion alarm communicators, enterprise access control   system and architectural locking products remains our focus. The   management team here at NAPCO continues to focus on the key   metrics of growth, profit and return on equity. These metrics are   important for us as well as our shareholders. Our business   strategy is to executing well and our interests are aligned with   our shareholders as senior management at NAPCO owns 38% of the   equity.

Before I go into greater detail, I'll now turn the call over   to our CFO, Kevin Buchel. He will provide an overview of our   fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year financial results, and then   I'll be back with more on our strategies and outlook. Kevin?

 Kevin S. Buchel    --   Senior Vice President of Operations and Finance and Chief   Financial Officer 

Thank you, Dick, and good morning, everybody. For the fourth   quarter, net sales increased 9% to $29.6 million, which was a   record quarterly performance and the 20th consecutive quarter of   year-over-year record sales, as compared to $27.3 million for the   same period a year ago. For fiscal 2019, net sales increased 12%   to a record $102.9 million, as compared with $91.7 million a year   ago. The increase in sales for the quarter were primarily related   to increased sales of our alarm communication services,   door-locking products and access control products. For the full   fiscal year, the increase in sales was primarily related to   increased sales from alarm communication services and products,   door-locking products and access control products. Recurring   monthly revenue from the alarm division increased 44% for the   quarter and 45% for the fiscal year. Recurring revenue now has an   annual run rate of $20.4 million based on June 2019 recurring   revenue.

Gross profit for the fourth quarter increased 7% to $12.9   million with a gross margin of 44%, as compared to $12.1 million   with a gross margin of 45% last year. Gross profit for fiscal   year 2019 increased 16% to $43.9 million with a gross margin of   43%, as compared to $38 million with a gross margin of 41% last   year. The increase in gross profit for the fourth quarter and the   fiscal year was primarily due to the increase in sales as   partially offset by increased salary and freight expenses.

The slight decrease in gross margin in the fourth quarter was   primarily due to product mix, as well as additional sales   discounts given related to several new product launches. The   increase in gross margin for the fiscal year was primarily due to   the 45% increase in recurring revenue, where the gross margin was   78%, as well as the leverage from the Dominican Republic   manufacturing facility generated from equipment revenue increases   of 7%. Also, please note that the tariff situation with China has   no effect on our margins as we manufacture virtually 100% in the   Dominican Republic. Even when we get raw materials from China,   they're shipped directly to the DR, so no tariffs. Our   competition is not as fortunate. They have tariff issues on both   finished and raw material.

R&D expenses for the fourth quarter increased 8% to $1.9   million or 6% of sales compared to $1.7 million or 6% of sales   last year. For the fiscal year, R&D expenses increased 9% to   $7.2 million or 7% of sales as compared to $6.6 million or 7% of   sales last year. The increase for the three months and the full   year was primarily due to additional personnel.

SG&A expenses for Q4 increased 3% year-over-year to $6.3   million or 21% of sales as compared to $6.1 million or 23% of   sales last year. For the fiscal 2019, SG&A expenses increased   1% to $23.2 million or 23% of sales as compared to $23 million or   25% of sales last year. The increases in dollars was primarily   from increases in employee compensation. The decrease as a   percentage of sales was primarily the result of the percentage   increase of sales exceeding the increase in selling, general and   administrative expense.

Operating income for the fourth quarter increased 11% to $4.8   million as compared to $4.3 million last year. For the fiscal   year, operating income increased 60% to $13.5 million compared to   $8.4 million last year.

Income tax expense for the quarter decreased by $531,000 to   $35,000, as compared to $566,000 last year. Income tax expense   for fiscal 2019 increased $538,000 to $1.2 million as compared to   $684,000 for the same period a year ago. The decrease in income   tax expense for the fourth quarter was primarily due to the   recognition of increased R&D tax credit. The increase in   income tax expense for the fiscal year was primarily due to the   aforementioned increase in operating income. The Company's   effective tax rate remained relatively constant at 9% for fiscal   2019 as compared to 8% for fiscal 2018.

Net income for the fourth quarter increased 28% to a fourth   quarter record of $4.7 million, which equates to 16% of net sales   or $0.26 per diluted share as compared to $3.7 million or $0.20   per diluted share last year. For the year, net income increased   60% to a record $12.2 million, which equates to 12% of net sales   or $0.66 per diluted share, as compared to $7.6 million or $0.41   per diluted share for the same period a year ago. The change in   net income for the quarter and the year ended June 30, 2019, was   primarily due to the items previously mentioned.

Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, as outlined in the schedule   included in today's press release, increased 10% to $5.2 million,   which equates to 17% of net sales or $0.28 per diluted share   compared to $4.7 million or $0.25 per diluted share last year.   For the year, adjusted EBITDA increased 51% to $15 million, which   equates to 15% of net sales or $0.81 per diluted share as   compared to $10 million or $0.53 for diluted share last year.

Moving on to the balance sheet. The cash balance at June 30,   2019, was $8 million as compared to $5.3 million at June 30,   2018. Our working capital as of June 30, 2019 was $51.1 million   as compared to $44.3 million at June 30, 2018. Current ratio is   4.6:1 at June 30, 2019 as compared with 5.7:1 at June 30, 2018.   And debt remained at zero at June 30, 2019.

Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was   $2.9 million[Phonetic] and for the full fiscal year was $8.7   million. Inventory levels remain higher than normal as we are   gearing up for several new product launches, including iSecure,   our new Marks' anti-ligature lock, and our new line of AT&T   LTE StarLink Radio, all of which, I think, we'll cover   momentarily. Capex was $388,000 during the quarter and was 1.9 --   $1,988,000 for the year.

That concludes my formal remarks, and I would now like to   return the call back to Dick.

 Richard L. Soloway    --   President and Chief Executive Officer 

Kevin, thank you. The growth of our business is strong, and we   believe the trend will continue in the future. Demand for our   recurring revenue product is coming from alarm communications,   including fire, intrusion and the growth of the smart home   category. We continue to believe that the market opportunity for   school security in the United States is significant. There are   approximately 100,000 K-12 and 10,000 colleges and universities   in the US. None of us will ever forget the tragic event that took   place during 2018 and continue to take place this year. We remain   dedicated to providing solutions and products that schools that   desperately need.

During our past conference calls, we have discussed an   increased volume of legislation being passed by many states since   2018, which includes funding of $1 billion. According to a US   News & World Report article from earlier this year, states   are considering nearly 250 different school safety builds in   2019. This underscores how the issue remains front and center for   everyone. The federal government, you may recall, in 2018 passed   a grant program which has allocated $100 million dollars per year   through 2028 for school security. We're also aware of other   pending legislation, which we are monitoring. The pipeline for   school security products looks robust. And we will continue to   announce new wins when we can, as we need to receive approval   from the schools prior to doing so.

Recently, we have witnessed more and more active shooter   incidences taking place at houses of worship and other public   meeting places. We have seen a need to expand the use of our SAVI   audit system for these location. The continuing violence in   public area is painting a clear picture for the need to secure   these areas with our products, such as wireless locks and access   control.

During Q4, we began the launch of our new AT&T LTE   StarLink line of universal fire, intrusion alarm and IoT   communicators. We now have StarLink lines on both Horizon and the   AT&T LTE network, which provides our dealers with the largest   LTE service coverage in the US. Also, we will be launching the   new version of our Marks Division anti-ligature locks. These   locks meet ADA, that's American with Disabilities Act,   requirements as well as the BHMA highest anti-ligature standard.   The shaping and structure of these locksets are designed to   restrict the attachment of lines, laces, etc, to doorknobs and   levers. The locksets are offered in unprecedented, cylindrical,   mortise styles, models and functions and provide easy   installation and retrofit to all popular door constructions.

We are very excited about the upcoming launch of our latest   product iSecure. It was debuted at the ISC West Trade Show in Las   Vegas in April of this year. The iSecure is designed for the new   breed of professional installers and savvy consumers. It has   quick installation time, and its advanced features are perfect   for smart home applications so in demand today. The iSecure won   the MVP, that's the Most Valuable Product, Award in the Home   Controls category at the trade show and drew lots of traffic from   dealers into our trade show booth.

Lastly, our FireLink Fire Alarm Control Panel with a built-in   cellular communicator was launched earlier this year. FireLink,   an all-in-one 8-32 zone fire alarm panel with built-in cellular   LTE StarLink-powered communicator, has grown quickly in sales.   FireLink comes pre-configured and pre-activated enabling easy   installation and cost savings for dealer. FireLink will add to   our already rapidly growing recovering revenue.

We'll begin our Q&A session portion of this call in a   moment.

Our fiscal year 2019 was a very successful record-breaking   year for us as we continued to grow the Company and deliver   strong profits. Our shareholders have been rewarded with very   healthy returns and stock performance. NAPCO is in a strong   position to continue its growth in sales and profits going   forward. We are excited about the future fiscal year 2020 and   beyond. NAPCO's senior management maintains a higher level of   ownership in our equity, approximately 38%, and I would like to   thank everyone for their support and for joining us in the   exciting future we have.

Our formal remarks are now concluded. We'd like to open the   call for the Q&A session. Operator, please proceed.

 Operator 

Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer   session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from   the line of Jaeson Schmidt with Lake Street Capital. Please   proceed with your question.

 Jaeson Schmidt    --   Lake Street Capital -- Analyst 

Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I just want to   start with the security market -- school security market. It   seems like you are seeing some really nice traction there. Can   you comment if you're seeing the size of the installed increasing   over the past few months here?

 Richard L. Soloway    --   President and Chief Executive Officer 

This -- good morning. There are many different types of jobs   that we're getting, and some of them are larger than others, and   we always find that with the jobs that we do, the schools,   especially universities, keep adding to that. So we've done some   schools -- we've gone back four times, keep doing the dorm   buildings and the classrooms and the executive offices. But   they're all different sizes all over the country. If you've seen   the press releases we've put out, they're all starting to come   together where localities want to protect their students, come to   the realization this is not going to stop unless something major   is done in policy within the country, which that looks like that   kind of stymied, I don't know what's going to happen with   that.

So the only way around all this is to put in school security.   And our line of school security is the widest school security   line in the industry. And that we make stand-alone, we make   remote control, we make systems where you can have a man trap and   lock an active shooter between doorways. There are different ways   of configuring our systems that we're very flexible. So we expect   that to continue small, medium and large job, and each job   increasing in volume as they add more facilities too them.

 Jaeson Schmidt    --   Lake Street Capital -- Analyst 

Okay. That's helpful. And along those lines, just given the   increasing correction in that market, do you expect to need to   add to headcount in a significant way to address all the   opportunities?

 Richard L. Soloway    --   President and Chief Executive Officer 

We have a very nice network of sales agents and reps and in   fact, we've made an integration between the Marks group and the   Alarm Lock group. So we have more sales people, and they are more   intense in their territory. But we don't expect to see an   increase in -- for the new year. In fact, this year the SG&A   was basically flat. We are very budget conscious. We wanted to   make sure we get the most efficiency out of each of our sales   people. As far as the manufacturing side of the business, we're   in the Dominican Republic. Our components are shipped in from all   over Asia, and we do all our assembly there. The minimum wage in   the Dominican Republic is $2,500 a year, so it's not really   material. If you get another 50 workers assembling products, the   margins are great on the product, so that it's not really a   material effect. So we're pretty stable in both of these areas,   both sales, marketing and manufacturing.

 Jaeson Schmidt    --   Lake Street Capital -- Analyst 

Okay. And the last one for me and I'll jump back into queue. I   know previously you threw out a $40 million recurring revenue run   rate target for fiscal 2021. Do you still feel confident in that   target?

 Kevin S. Buchel    --   Senior Vice President of Operations and Finance and Chief   Financial Officer 

Not only do I feel confident -- it's Kevin. Not only do I feel   confident, Jaeson, I thought, we would be pushing hard to get to   $20 million -- we got to twenty $20.4 million run rate. $40   million, we could beat it. And I'm just keeping -- I'm still   saying $40 million. But if we had recurring revenue into the   other areas of the business, like we talked about, we try to get   it into the locking side, the access, we'll blow past the $40   million. For now, let's just call it $40 million by June of   2021.

 Jaeson Schmidt    --   Lake Street Capital -- Analyst 

Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.

 Kevin S. Buchel    --   Senior Vice President of Operations and Finance and Chief   Financial Officer 

You're welcome, Jaeson.

 Richard L. Soloway    --   President and Chief Executive Officer 

Thank you.

 Operator 

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike   Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your   question.

 Mike Walkley    --   Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst 

Great. Thanks. Great to see the recurring revenue growth and   reiteration of targets. Just a question for me on the hardware   gross margin side. What about -- maybe a little bit closer to 40%   with the $24 million hardware revenue achieved this quarter, can   you talk a little bit about the mix that impacted margins for the   quarter and maybe a little more color on some of the price   discounts that you gave during the quarter?

 Kevin S. Buchel    --   Senior Vice President of Operations and Finance and Chief   Financial Officer 

One of the[Phonetic] things -- we tried to do by -- is to   capture a lot of the AT&T radio market -- LTE. And we   introduced that in the fourth quarter, and our thought process   was to capture that market, because once we start getting the   recurring revenue, we got that pretty much for life. It is a big   market. We didn't have it. We're starting to get it. I would put   about 2% margin effect in the quarter because of that. So I would   have expected normal situation to be at 40% also. We came in and   basically set 37%. So there is a 3% differential. 2% I would say,   is because of discounts we gave on the new product introduction.   1%, I would say, is due to the mixed -- sometimes there's mix   differences. If we get a big school job at a university in one   quarter and you get a job that's not as big the following year,   that could easily affect it by 1%. Nothing that we saw out of the   ordinary to have a 1% differential on mix. Not that unusual. The   part that was different was the 2% because of discount. Virtually   all due to the AT&T LTE radio intro.

 Mike Walkley    --   Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst 

Great, thanks. And then maybe just building on that, you   highlighted all kinds of new products ramping in the coming   quarters. How should we think maybe about mix from the new   products? How does that impact gross margin in the short term on   the hardware side? Obviously, growing recurring revenue is great   for the long term, but how should we maybe think about short-term   margins given some of these new products coming into the   model?

 Kevin S. Buchel    --   Senior Vice President of Operations and Finance and Chief   Financial Officer 

I think, in Q1 you'll see a little more of what we saw in Q4   in the introduction, because the LTE -- that's a big area for us.   You'll see a little more of that. I don't think you'll see any   discounting or we introduce the new anti-lig, that's a very   expensive high margin product to begin with. And everybody wants   to get their hands on the new version. We don't have to do that.   We're like one of the few that manufactured this. The iSecure   that's coming out of the gate very aggressively priced. We don't   have to discount that beyond what it is. People are going to jump   at that, just because the price is so good right out of the gate.   It is going to blow away the competition. So I don't expect any   discounting on that one either. It's really a little bit more on   the radio side, but we believe that the recurring growing   dramatically like it has with 78% to 80% gross margin that -- it   will more than make up for that.

 Mike Walkley    --   Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst 

Thanks, and last question for me and I'll pass on. Just on the   recurring revenue given your conference, you still think of like   40% plus year-over-year growth rate? Or does it slow in the short   term and accelerate as the new products start to ramp? And then   secondly, just given the ramp at AT&T, any color how it's   going so far, maybe relative to the Verizon launch? Thank   you.

 Richard L. Soloway    --   President and Chief Executive Officer 

We expect that, the $40 million is the number that we're going   to hit in June 30, 2021[Phonetic] year. We think that with the   AT&T, the iSecure and some of the locking products that are   going to be generating recurring revenue, which is revolutionary   for the business never been done before in the whole industry.   Locks traditionally don't generate recurring revenue. They're a   one-off sale, but our versions of the locks will generate   recurring revenue. The installation companies as well as end   users. We think that we can go beyond the $40 million and we'll   do -- do to get our market share. But I think that the price   point that we've established are going to be pretty stable. And   we're going to hit that number of $40 million and beyond. That's   how we look at it.

 Mike Walkley    --   Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst 

Thanks. Thank you.

 Richard L. Soloway    --   President and Chief Executive Officer 

Okay, Mike.

 Operator 

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Pfau   with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.

 Matt Pfau    --   William Blair -- Analyst 

Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask on   hardware growth in the quarter. It's the lowest for the year. And   -- but the full year was about 7%, which is sort of in line with   what you guys have talked about longer term. Was there anything   disappointing in the quarter or one-off in the quarter that had   that growth rate below the other quarters and the year? And how   do we think about that growth rate going forward as the fourth   quarter more indicative of the go forward, or is the full-year   growth more of how we should think about it?

 Kevin S. Buchel    --   Senior Vice President of Operations and Finance and Chief   Financial Officer 

The hardware growth for the full year of 7% was one of the   highest increases we've had in years. We've been saying our goal   is to get the high single or double digit. So 7%, we're on our   way to high single, I don't think there's any reason for us to   believe why we can't do more better from a percentage point of   view for fiscal 2020. Since we're introducing so many things   between, iSecure, the new anti-lig, the new radios, the FireLink   panel hasn't been out that long. We're doing -- we spend a lot of   money on R&D, for us a lot, hasn't gone up by that much but   $7.2 million this past year? They're spending a lot of time on   doing a lot of things that get us more recurring and more   hardware. The hardware sales is very important to us too. The   Dominican leverage we talked about is very important. Just we   didn't see it as much in Q4, but you saw it for the full year.   And that's a big part of what we're doing. We're getting so busy   down there. We're going to be going to a second shift on radios   soon. These are all good things. So if I was projecting out, I   would still believe that low-single -- I mean, high-single digits   for Q -- for the full year, even though it was lower in Q4 it's   Still a goal and still very achievable.

 Matt Pfau    --   William Blair -- Analyst 

Got it. And then on the school security side, you mentioned   all these funding bills that are out there and the fees that have   passed. How big of an impact has the government funding been to   the school security business or is that still more of an   opportunity with some of these bills being passed, potentially   accelerating the growth of that business?

 Richard L. Soloway    --   President and Chief Executive Officer 

We're seeing an increase in school security jobs. We're   publishing them as we get them. There's many, many more queue if   the schools are being -- it they're getting some funding from   their regional area, we expect there's going to be federal   funding, there is going to be legislation put out. So all of this   primes the pump to get a lot more business. And since we have a   offering for K-12, which are low-cost, easy-to-convert K-12 to   more secure places for the student and not that expensive to do.   Schools are jumping the gun and doing their own financing of this   through state legislature and counties around the country. The   college or universities have large endowments. They're using that   money in anticipation of more money coming down. And we're seeing   a better situation in the schools that make these moves, and   they're going to be much more protective for the students.

So we see this all in a very positive light. It's going to   take many, many years of growth and the schools will be secure.   But as far as we could see, I could see five years of continuous   school growth ahead of us, and the big money is going to really   come down.

 Matt Pfau    --   William Blair -- Analyst 

Got it. And in terms of the hurricane that's currently   impacting the Caribbean, any impact there to your operations in   the Dominican? I realized it didn't hit there. But in terms of   getting the goods out of the Dominican to the US, are there any   disruption there from the hurricane?

 Richard L. Soloway    --   President and Chief Executive Officer 

We haven't -- we -- our factor is Category 5 in the Dominican   Republic. So the hurricane itself didn't hit. There's going to be   -- we ship things both by air and by sea. Though we haven't   gotten feedback yet from the ocean shipping companies. But they   are on top of their game. So we expect with the amount of   inventory we have here that we'll be able to satisfy all demand   and keep things rolling. But let's see how things go in the next   week or so.

 Matt Pfau    --   William Blair -- Analyst 

Okay. Got it. That's it for me, guys. Thanks a lot.

 Richard L. Soloway    --   President and Chief Executive Officer 

Thanks, Matt.

 Operator 

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line   of Jeff Kessler with Imperial Capital. Please proceed with your   question.

 Jeff Kessler    --   Imperial Capital -- Analyst 

Thank you. Thank you for taking my question. It's probably   fair to say that there is a little bit of a surprise up on the   analyst part in looking at how much you spent on some of the new   investments that you're making, the AT&T radio capturing that   part of that market? And I'm wondering -- this brings up two   questions. Number 1, do you think that, Number 1, by keeping this   under wraps, at least publicly, not talking about what you were   going to invest in, do you think you've been able to take the   competitive market a little bit by surprise since you've already   been in the Verizon side of the market? You haven't been in the   AT&T market so heavily. Do you think that you again, taken a   little bit of the AT&T folks on the communication side by   surprise?

And Number 2, are these investments that you're making now,   where do you see the returns coming? Let's get -- if you want to   call it a little bit earlier and which ones are you going to be   taking a little bit longer to play out over the course of the   next fiscal year and a half?

 Richard L. Soloway    --   President and Chief Executive Officer 

Jeff, these are complicated questions. It's not an exact   science, but it's always good to sneak up on the competition, and   that's what the AT&T radios are very important launch, and   you hit the nail right on the head. We're going to have   tremendous success with AT&T radios to grow our recurring   revenue. And we had to do we had to do to run run the business in   a very solid way for mid-term and long-term, and that AT&T   radio nationwide makes us very unique of the fact that we're   doing fire with it as well as home and more business. So it's an   important thing to do, and it bodes well for our future. We   expect that between AT&T radios and iSecure and every iSecure   has a radio built into it, so that every alarm that's installed.   Going forward iSecure, which we expect to be a real volume   producer will generate recurring revenue for us. And having it on   all these network is very important. So if you want more detail,   we could do a conversation later on getting in deeper if you want   to go deeper than this.

 Jeff Kessler    --   Imperial Capital -- Analyst 

Sure. And as far as if you want to -- I don't see a schedule,   but what do you see as -- which are we going to be seeing the   returns from a little bit earlier, which are really seeing the   returns from a little bit later? Are those investments that you   were making over the last quarter and into -- and obviously into   the next quarter?

 Richard L. Soloway    --   President and Chief Executive Officer 

Our investments are -- we have this goal -- we have of the   goal at June 30, 2021 that we're going to be at $40 million in   recurring and we're going to be a $100 million in hardware   manufacturing. And if you put that together and you are over   $1.30 a share and that is our goal. And we're doing everything we   can to win market share to get to our goal and go beyond our   goal. And it looks like, this is working for us.

 Jeff Kessler    --   Imperial Capital -- Analyst 

Okay. One final question. One of the real big issues that I'm   dealing with right now and which the industry is -- overall is   dealing with right now to try to -- not just prop up, but to --   just to reinforce the value proposition is the difference between   verified and unverified alarm signals out there? The difference   between convenience and having a professional service, to have   police show up within five or six minutes on the residential   side, not just on the commercial side. What are you folks -- what   are you doing? And I'm thinking about iSecure in companies and   products like that. What are you doing to accelerate the   industry's -- the professional industry's ability to have police   and, of course, the PSAPs, 911[Phonetic] centers, except the   signals more readily and allow police to come in and respond   without having false alarms?

 Richard L. Soloway    --   President and Chief Executive Officer 

Well, a lot of the false alarms are caused by DIY products,   not professionally installed products. DIY products are not   attached to the walls, to the ceiling that well, they move and   they cause a false alarm or they're not close enough to the   magnetic contacts to go on the windows. So that caused a lot of   false alarms. Our iSecure is not aimed for the DIY market, but   its price point and its functionality is to put the dealer --   professional dealer in the game of installing more and more alarm   systems, which compete against the DIY products.

So it's very professionally installed, which eliminate a lot   of the false alarms you're getting DIY. And we're trying to arm   our dealers and the dealers across the nation with a product,   which has a better return on investment, more reliable, more   feature rich and installs with less false alarms. That's our   contribution to what's going on. I   t report    s to all Central Station. It reports daily and it works to our   back-end NOC, which has the ability to give it additional   functionality to eliminate false alarm. And we can talk about   that off line -- since I know that you and the industry and us   were all components of keeping the police respond to real alarms   not false alarms, that's the major thing in the industry. But we   can talk offline and go through exactly what this does from a   [Speech Overlap]

 Jeff Kessler    --   Imperial Capital -- Analyst 

Great, Richard. Yes, that's great. Okay, thank you very much.   I Appreciate.

 Richard L. Soloway    --   President and Chief Executive Officer

2019-09-03 07:52:00," Shares of Skechers U.S.A., Inc  . SKX  have outperformed the industry  and the overall sector  year to date. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock has gained 38.3% compared with the industry's growth of 13.4% and the overall sector's 16.1%.    makeArticleAd();  Markedly, Skechers' increased focus on new line of products, corporate upgrades and store remodeling projects, cost-containment efforts, inventory management, and global distribution platform bode well.  Also, the company has a remarkable earnings history, with the bottom line recording the fourth straight quarter of positive earnings surprise in second-quarter 2019.    Notably, management is optimistic about the third quarter. It guided third-quarter 2019 earnings of 65-70 cents a share and net sales of $1.325-$1.350 billion. The company had reported earnings of 58 cents and net sales of $1.176 billion in the prior-year quarter.    That said, let's delve deeper into the factors driving the stock.   Key Factors    The international business is a considerable sales growth driver for Skechers, with Europe and China being significant markets outside the United States. The company intends to enhance global reach in the footwear market through its distribution networks, subsidiaries and JVs. In this regard, the joint venture in Mexico with its distribution partner is paying off well.    Notably, its international wholesale business grew 18.2%, while direct-to-consumer business improved 25.8%. The international wholesale business grew on account of a 30.7% increase in distributor business, 13.4% in joint ventures and 18.5% in wholly-owned subsidiaries. Notably, management projects international and direct-to-consumer businesses to sustain momentum, and increase in mid-teen and high-single digits, respectively, in the remaining part of the year.    Further, the company's domestic e-commerce business grew 36.1% during the second quarter of 2019. Also, comparable-store sales climbed 4.9%, including e-commerce sales growth of 34.3%. Additionally, the company is on track with product innovation, additional store openings and increasing distribution channels by entering agreements to boost sales and profitability.   The Bottom Line    Skechers continues to offer a diversified portfolio of brands that includes a wide range of fashion, athletic, non-athletic and work footwear at compelling prices. We believe this multi-brand strategy enables the company to roll out products without cannibalizing its existing brands and helps expand the targeted demographic profile of customers. The company is making strategic investments to improve its infrastructure worldwide, primarily e-commerce platforms and distribution centers.   Looking for More?

Let's see what's in store for the company in the quarter to be reported.  makeArticleAd(); Estimates Look Dull    The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at a loss of 71 cents, which suggests deterioration from a loss of 40 cents delivered in the year-ago quarter.

Price, Consensus and EPS   Surprise           Kirkland's, Inc.   price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart    |   Kirkland's, Inc. Quote      What's Likely to Impede Q2 Performance?    Kirkland's is facing adverse impacts from low traffic in its brick-and-mortar stores as more customers are resorting to online buying. This has been weighing on the company's comparable store sales (comps) as witnessed in the first quarter. In fact, management expects sales in the first half of fiscal 2019 to be challenged by weakness in brick-and-mortar traffic and core assortments. For this period, it expects comps to decline in the low-to-mid single digit range. Persistent sluggishness in comps is likely to hurt the company's top- and the bottom-line performances in the to-be-reported quarter.    Weak gross margin rates have also been a hurdle for Kirkland's. The metric is under pressure from headwinds like lower merchandise margins as well as higher store occupancy and central distribution costs. Moreover, the decline in merchandise margins is being triggered by inbound freight costs and a decline in product margins. Softness in gross margin remains a considerable threat to the bottom line in the second quarter. Apart from these, management is cautious about any adverse impacts stemming from additional tariffs.    Although such adversities are likely to impede the company's second-quarter results, we expect it to gain some respite from growth in e-commerce as well as increased efficiency in merchandising, branding and product designing capabilities.   What Does the Zacks Model Predict?    Our proven model doesn't show that Kirkland can beat bottom-line estimates in the to-be-reported quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

Typically, a security that generates a 38% dividend yield means only one thing: run! And while that metric may seem like a fantasy, it's actually a very real narrative for GameStop (NYSE: GME ). Beleaguered from a massive shift in the retail video game landscape, GameStop stock has never looked like a legitimate investment since the middle of this decade.

However, two major news items have breathed new life into GME stock. First, Sony (NYSE: SNE ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) announced earlier this year that their next-generation gaming consoles will utilize physical discs. Now, this is old news. However, a second catalyst has forced many analysts to reconsider it in a new light.

And that spark comes in the form of famed short-seller Michael Burry . Famously, Burry predicted last decade's sub-prime mortgage. Additionally, he put his money where his mouth was, profiting from the downfall. His exploits later inspired the film ""The Big Short.""

Usually, movies about the financial markets draw snores. But like many audience members, I was engrossed not only by the story, but also the implications. Burry, played by Christian Bale, was a reclusive genius. However, people really didn't understand the latter attribute until they profited handsomely from his outrageous call.

How many of us wished we had access to Burry and his unconventional approach to the markets? Well, now we do. Burry is going long GameStop stock.

It's an intriguing contrarian play. To us, betting on GME stock makes as much sense as the idea of shorting the mortgage industry must have been prior to the bubble collapse.

But is this genuinely good advice on GameStop stock, or has Burry's reputation preceded him?

Before we get into the details, we should reiterate a general point: you should never invest in an equity just based on an advisor's prior success. Obviously, Burry scored big on his big short. But can lightning strike twice? Maybe it can, or maybe he was just lucky that first time.

As far as I know, there's no sequel to ""The Big Short.""

But specific to GameStop stock, the overriding reason why people are so bearish is because of the Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) effect; namely, gamers are increasingly gravitating toward the convenience of video game downloads.

After all, why go through the hassle of driving to the store, waiting in line, and driving back home? Instead, you can just download your target game in the comfort of your own home.

Furthermore, console developers are moving toward subscription models similar to Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ). Rather than spending gobs of money for each new release, you pay a nominal fee monthly. Then, you have access to a much wider range of games than you would have buying them individually.

And these aren't just talking points: they're negatively impacting the GameStop stock price. Just open a five-year chart and the debate is over.

While GME stock seems like a far-fetched bet, I'm not going to dismiss that Burry is a genius. Plus, he might be onto something here.

First, video game downloads aren't without their limitations. With today's data-intensive games, you've got to have super high-speed internet; otherwise, you're going to spend all day (or even night) to get them.

Moreover, not all Americans have access to high-speed internet. In fact, one of the underlying issues with the T-Mobile US (NASDAQ: TMUS ) and Sprint (NYSE: S ) merger is the rural customer . Theoretically, a merger would provide rural internet users with a comprehensively more competent high-speed internet solution. But for now, they must make do with inferior service.

Beyond that, high-speed internet is expensive, and some folks may not have the means to afford it, especially under a recession.

This brings me to my second point. If we do have a recession, GameStop stock levers a critical advantage. In an economic downturn, customers will cut unnecessary expenditures. I'd call video game subscriptions unnecessary. But used physical games for half their new sticker price or better? That would fly very well, especially because recessions incentivize cheap entertainment .

Additionally, we sometimes forget the fact that as technology improves, so too does their data and storage demands. There's a reason why Sony and Microsoft both elected physics disc formats for their upcoming consoles: next-gen games are extremely data-intensive, and that burden will only increase.

For now, downloading such behemoths on the regular is too much.

I nearly soiled myself when I saw the dividend yield for GME stock. This is about as desperate of a long play as you're going to find.

However, Burry is in many ways a visionary. I think part of his thesis involves the concept that we're headed toward a recession. If that's true, consumer behaviors will necessarily change. And this change is what would drive the bull case for GameStop stock.

Now, I'm not clear as to how long Burry intends to hold GME stock. But if you're looking for a nearer-term gamble, I believe the outside fundamentals are surprisingly positive.

As of this writing, Josh Enomoto is long SNE.

NEW YORK, Sept 3 (IFR) - Mexican multinational bakery Grupo Bimbo became the first LatAm issuer to raise dollars in over a month on Tuesday, drawing strong demand for a 30-year offering.

The firm, rated Baa2/BBB/BBB, upsized an initial US$500m deal to print US$600m with final order books reaching US$2.5bn.

Leads on Bimbo's new deal, BBVA, Citi, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and MUFG tightened pricing by about 25bps to T+215bp from initial price thoughts.

The 4.00% 2049 note priced at 98.334, to yield 4.097%, slightly outside of the company's existing 4.7% 2047 notes, which were trading at 111.307 to yield 4.019% on Tuesday afternoon, according to MarketAxess.

""There is a lot of demand on that name from US institutional investors,"" said Roger Horn, a senior emerging markets strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities America.

""[Investors] can compare it to other US investment-grade or even global food product companies. It's a strong credit. Most of its activity is outside of Mexico and it has been treated like a safe heaven.""

Similarly rated American food products company Campbell Soup, rated Baa2/BBB-/BBB, has an existing 4.8% March 2048 bond currently changing hands at a price of around 112.047, to yield 4.045%, according to MarketAxess.

Moody's and Fitch both cited Bimbo's solid business position and strong liquidity in their analysis of the company.

""In light of the current market volatility, there might be a flight to quality and, given its long tenor, the (Grupo Bimbo) bond appears 'tailor-made' for pension funds,"" said credit analytics and research firm Tellimer in a report.

Proceeds of the transaction will go toward refinancing a portion of the company's existing $800 million 4.875% notes due 2020.

Grupo Bimbo was last in the dollar market in April 2018 when it sold a US$500m NC5 bond with a 5.950% coupon.",Grupo Bimbo breaks LatAm lull with low 30-year coupon - Nasdaq.com,https://www.nasdaq.com/article/grupo-bimbo-breaks-latam-lull-with-low-30year-coupon-20190903-01328

For the Invesco Zacks Mid-Cap ETF (Symbol: CZA), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $79.39 per unit.      With CZA trading at a recent price near $70.43 per unit, that means that analysts see 12.73% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of CZA's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Pembina Pipeline Corp (Symbol: PBA), Essent Group Ltd (Symbol: ESNT), and Hudson Pacific Properties Inc (Symbol: HPP).

Similarly, ESNT has 16.24% upside from the recent share price of $48.50 if the average analyst target price of $56.38/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting HPP to reach a target price of $38.83/share, which is 14.21% above the recent price of $34.00.

Once, just a simple maker of consumer gadgets, Roku has transformed itself into the must-have platform for streaming. This transition has asserted its dominance of the streaming sector. And along with that dominance, the streaming giant has started to seriously monetize its platform in a variety of ways.

The best part is that this could just be the beginning for Roku.

With its continued fast pace of user adoption and several new big streaming services coming down the pike, Roku should be able to keep these new sources of revenue humming alone. And that will be music to investor's ears. Yes, shares of ROKU have surged. But the streaming kingpin can keep its shares rising far into the future. That makes it a big-time buy even at today's levels.

One of the biggest stories right now happens to be Disney (NYSE: DIS ) and the launch of its Disney+ service. But here's the real question? How are you going to access it and get the Star Wars or Hanna Montana content your tween is going crazy for ? The answer quickly is becoming Roku.

The key for Roku is that its devices and now the embedded platform on many televisions. The key is that it's open-source. Everyone's apps and channels work well on the devices and OS. For consumers cutting the cord, Roku has been a blessing. Consumers can watch Hulu , their Disney+ and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) subscriptions all from the same device.

In fact, Roku hosts more than 5,000 third-party streaming applications. That's made Roku the standard streaming platform. And with active accounts now numbering 30.5 million or about 39% of all streaming households, every streaming service wants to be part of the action.

That's put Roku in a very enviable position. It's the gatekeeper. And the gatekeeper gets to make the rules. In this case, charging streaming networks a 20% to 30% revenue share fee for access to its platform. No wonder why Roku saw its total revenues surge by 59% year-over-year in its latest reported quarter .

But even those great results don't tell the whole picture. Digging in deeper and you can see why ROKU stock still has plenty of gas left in the streaming tank.

As we said, Roku makes most of its money via its platform- about 65% of its total revenues- versus device sales. Lately, the firm has made some serious moves to monetize that further. That has it becoming the next biggest advertising play.

This includes its propriety Roku Channel, which serves as a hub for many shows and movies as well as ads on its homepage/start-up screen. The firm gets a slice of advertising revenue for those non-subscription streaming services such as Cheddar and Crackle that use its platform as well. Here, Roku places ads for the services.

Heck, it even makes a hefty penny by selling the space on its device remotes for dedicated buttons that send viewers directly to a channel.

With the number of active viewers continuing to rise, Roku is pulling in a lot of user data, and it is starting to massage that cache of data in a big way. Every time we click on a movie, watch a show, engage with an ad, Roku starts to build a profile; just like Facebook (NYSE: FB ) does on the web. The Roku Audience Marketplace allows marketers to tap into this trove of data in real-time.

It's no secret that marketers are pulling their ad spend away from more traditional means and placing them on the web and in mobile channels. Unlike traditional cable television upon which advertisers simply buy time during popular shows, streaming can be customized. They want to target specific consumers that are more likely to buy or use a specific product or service. Given the sheer amount of data that Roku users make, it's a virtual goldmine.

And Roku gets a piece of it all. Platform revenues for the firm jumped more than 86% last quarter. Moreover, platform revenues remain very juicy in terms of margins. Roku now makes just over $21 per active user on its network. That's very impressive.

The best part is that Roku has a chance to keep the data/advertising following. Next year promises to be a major one in terms of new streaming services and networks- Disney+ notwithstanding. If they want to play ball, they have to be on Roku's platform. It's simply becoming the standard both via its own devices and as an OS already installed on televisions. That'll allow it to clip more revenues.

With cord-cutting becoming an unstoppable trend, analysts now estimate that the firm will have more than 80 million users by 2025 . That's will allow it to produce more data, which in turn will drive advertising sales.

In the end, ROKU stock has surprised most investors with its strong performance. But we haven't seen anything yet. Like FB and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Roku has created something that users can't live without. And now that they are hooked, it's going to make money on them while they enjoy the platform.

With growth rates rivaling NFLX during its heyday, ROKU has lots of years of gains ahead. The stock isn't cheap, but given the growth, it could be a big buy on any pullbacks.

Disclosure: At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt held a Long position in AMZN and ROKU

How to defend against this tough equity market? Some say to     buy defensive sectors like healthcare and consumer staples.     Others buy gold. Ironically, however, the best protection may     be to stick with the old 60/40 balanced portfolio. Despite all     the market turmoil recently, if you had been holding a 60% SPY     and 40% AGG portfolio over the last month you would have had a     net return of negative 0.62%, which is pretty good considering     how ugly markets were. If you had been holding it for the whole     year, you would have a sterling return of 14.45%.

September is usually a very poor month for stocks. Investors     are generally uptight because of this, but this year tensions     are much higher after a brutal August that saw benchmarks fall     around 3%, a figure which frankly does not do justice to the     turmoil. The Dow actually averages a large decline in September     historically, and the month has only had positives returns 36%     of the time in the last 100 years. This statement from Barron's     says it all: ""If you only owned the S&P 500 in September     during every year, a $100 investment starting in 1969 would now     be worth just $70.

 FINSUM      :     September is usually bad (which does not really mean     anything for this year in itself), but this year could be extra     ugly because it may just be more of the same turmoil that has     already been occurring.

2019-09-03 15:17:00," Amazon AMZN  is strengthening its position in India despite regulatory setbacks; it is investing in a leading Indonesian ecommerce company; increasing logistics capabilities in Canada; and helping the police, getting sued by publishers and defeating the IRS in the U.S.  India  India's crackdown on fraudulent practices by non-banking financial institutions and its move to ban international auditing firm Deloitte and a KPMG affiliate has rattled corporate heads, contributing to lower growth rates and impacting the stock market. Amazon India head Amit Agarwal took the opportunity to say that India could improve its growth rates by promoting ecommerce rather than holding it back with red tape and unfriendly laws. He also said that Amazon's push for SMB exports had contributed a billion dollars to the country's exports and that the next three years would see this number climb to $5 billion. Amazon is specifically opposing the government's move to protect small sellers that can't compete with the deep discounts on the platform. The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) are accusing big retailers like Amazon of continuing to use complex measures to circumvent the protective law that went into effect this February. Agarwal's comments seem to indicate that the company is opposing rather than requesting time to build the data centers necessary to store Indian data within its borders, in line with global sentiments. Amazon has however inaugurated a new campus in the southern city of Hyderabad and there are no known plans of slowing down investment in the country, where Prime memberships continue to grow at the fastest rate in the world. Amazon is making arrangements to acquire a larger stake in Future Retail, one of the leading traditional retail chains in India. So, through Amazon.Com NV Investment Holdings LLC it has agreed to buy a 49% stake in Future Coupons Ltd, which holds warrants that can be converted partly or wholly into Future Retail shares. The warrants can be exercised in the next three to 10 years. It was earlier reported that Amazon was looking to buy a 10% stake in the company, valued at 20 billion rupees, or $278 million.  Investment in Indonesia's Gojek App  Bloomberg and Reuters are saying that Amazon is in talks to acquire a stake in Indonesian super app Gojek. Presumably the super prefix is because the app lets you hail rides, order dinner, shop groceries, make payments through a digital wallet, appoint cleaners, masseuses, hairdressers, etc, order medicines, and many other things. Its usefulness has enabled its expansion across Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, where it serves 260 million people and competes with Alibaba (BABA) and Shopee. In Indonesia, where it launched, ecommerce sales are expected to jump from the current $12.2 billion to $53 billion in the next five years. The terms of the deal aren't known, but it definitely looks like a good place to kick-start Amazon's investment in the region.  Equity Stake in Canadian Airline Cargojet  Amazon continues to corner logistics capabilities in an attempt to serve its customers better. So similar to its agreements with U.S. air carriers Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings AAWW  and Air Transport Services Group ATSG  , it has signed an agreement with Toronto-based Cargojet, which operates 21 freighters (Boeing 757s and 767s). Accordingly, Cargojet will issue warrants that can, after seven years, be converted into voting shares, giving Amazon a 9.9% stake in the company. In exchange, Amazon will make sure it contributes C$ 400 million in volumes through the period. There's also a separate agreement giving Amazon warrants to buy, after seven years, an additional 5% of variable voting shares, for C$ 200 million.  Partnership with 400 Police Forces  Amazon-owned Ring has set itself up for fresh controversy by partnering with 400 police departments across the country. It allows law enforcement access to video recorded by the camera system that typically detects motion and transmits to the user, which can be viewed and shared as desired. Policemen won't get live access to the data unless publicly shared, but only by requesting the home owner, who has the prerogative to refuse.   Privacy advocates and critics fear this could increase racial profiling, while turning police officers into salespeople for surveillance-systems and increase community paranoia. Amazon has also been criticized by at least 25 prominent artificial-intelligence researchers, including experts at Alphabet GOOGL  , Facebook FB  and Microsoft MSFT  , for selling its facial recognition technology called rekognition to law enforcement. The problem with so doing is its inability to correctly identify colored people. Amazon, however, has said that the technology is so great that it can also identify emotions like fear, happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust, calmness and confusion although it isn't against a certain amount of regulation. Its shareholders rejected proposals to stop selling the technology to government agencies and also to investigate privacy violations.  Amazon's Audible Sued for Copyright Infringement  Amazon doesn't appear to learn well from past mistakes, or tries to stretch what it can do with everything at its disposal. In the past, the company has got on the wrong side of publishers, authors and the Authors Guild because of unauthorized use of copyrights. And now it's doing pretty much the same thing with its audio book company Audible. Its new speech-to-text feature called ""Captions"" can use machine learning to reproduce voice recordings so children can see the text that they're hearing. The text may not be a hundred percent accurate, Amazon warns, and is intended to be more an education aid than anything else, according to the company. This is supposed to legalize the textual reproduction notwithstanding the fact that it will in all probability impact sales of print and digital book sales, hurting authors and publishers.  Of course, publishers, including Hachette, HarperCollins, Macmillan, Penguin Random House, Simon & Schuster, Chronicle Books and Scholastic don't agree with the thinking. So they and the Association of American Publishers, to which they subscribe, have sued Amazon in the Southern District Court of New York for copyright infringement.  IRS Appeal in U.S. Tax Dispute  Amazon won a 3-0 ruling in its favor at the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Seattle. The court upheld the 2017 U.S. tax court ruling against the IRS, represented by the Justice Department.

Amazon AMZN  is strengthening its position in India despite regulatory setbacks; it is investing in a leading Indonesian ecommerce company; increasing logistics capabilities in Canada; and helping the police, getting sued by publishers and defeating the IRS in the U.S.

 India 

India's crackdown on fraudulent practices by non-banking financial institutions and its move to ban international auditing firm Deloitte and a KPMG affiliate has rattled corporate heads, contributing to lower growth rates and impacting the stock market. Amazon India head Amit Agarwal took the opportunity to say that India could improve its growth rates by promoting ecommerce rather than holding it back with red tape and unfriendly laws.

He also said that Amazon's push for SMB exports had contributed a billion dollars to the country's exports and that the next three years would see this number climb to $5 billion.

Amazon is specifically opposing the government's move to protect small sellers that can't compete with the deep discounts on the platform. The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) are accusing big retailers like Amazon of continuing to use complex measures to circumvent the protective law that went into effect this February.

Agarwal's comments seem to indicate that the company is opposing rather than requesting time to build the data centers necessary to store Indian data within its borders, in line with global sentiments.

Amazon has however inaugurated a new campus in the southern city of Hyderabad and there are no known plans of slowing down investment in the country, where Prime memberships continue to grow at the fastest rate in the world.

Amazon is making arrangements to acquire a larger stake in Future Retail, one of the leading traditional retail chains in India. So, through Amazon.Com NV Investment Holdings LLC it has agreed to buy a 49% stake in Future Coupons Ltd, which holds warrants that can be converted partly or wholly into Future Retail shares. The warrants can be exercised in the next three to 10 years. It was earlier reported that Amazon was looking to buy a 10% stake in the company, valued at 20 billion rupees, or $278 million.

 Investment in Indonesia's Gojek App 

Bloomberg and Reuters are saying that Amazon is in talks to acquire a stake in Indonesian super app Gojek.

Presumably the super prefix is because the app lets you hail rides, order dinner, shop groceries, make payments through a digital wallet, appoint cleaners, masseuses, hairdressers, etc, order medicines, and many other things. Its usefulness has enabled its expansion across Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, where it serves 260 million people and competes with Alibaba (BABA) and Shopee. In Indonesia, where it launched, ecommerce sales are expected to jump from the current $12.2 billion to $53 billion in the next five years.

The terms of the deal aren't known, but it definitely looks like a good place to kick-start Amazon's investment in the region.

 Equity Stake in Canadian Airline Cargojet 

Amazon continues to corner logistics capabilities in an attempt to serve its customers better. So similar to its agreements with U.S. air carriers Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings AAWW  and Air Transport Services Group ATSG  , it has signed an agreement with Toronto-based Cargojet, which operates 21 freighters (Boeing 757s and 767s).

Accordingly, Cargojet will issue warrants that can, after seven years, be converted into voting shares, giving Amazon a 9.9% stake in the company. In exchange, Amazon will make sure it contributes C$ 400 million in volumes through the period. There's also a separate agreement giving Amazon warrants to buy, after seven years, an additional 5% of variable voting shares, for C$ 200 million.

 Partnership with 400 Police Forces 

Amazon-owned Ring has set itself up for fresh controversy by partnering with 400 police departments across the country.

It allows law enforcement access to video recorded by the camera system that typically detects motion and transmits to the user, which can be viewed and shared as desired. Policemen won't get live access to the data unless publicly shared, but only by requesting the home owner, who has the prerogative to refuse.  

Privacy advocates and critics fear this could increase racial profiling, while turning police officers into salespeople for surveillance-systems and increase community paranoia.

Amazon has also been criticized by at least 25 prominent artificial-intelligence researchers, including experts at Alphabet GOOGL  , Facebook FB  and Microsoft MSFT  , for selling its facial recognition technology called rekognition to law enforcement. The problem with so doing is its inability to correctly identify colored people.

Amazon, however, has said that the technology is so great that it can also identify emotions like fear, happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust, calmness and confusion although it isn't against a certain amount of regulation.

Its shareholders rejected proposals to stop selling the technology to government agencies and also to investigate privacy violations.

 Amazon's Audible Sued for Copyright Infringement 

Amazon doesn't appear to learn well from past mistakes, or tries to stretch what it can do with everything at its disposal. In the past, the company has got on the wrong side of publishers, authors and the Authors Guild because of unauthorized use of copyrights. And now it's doing pretty much the same thing with its audio book company Audible.

Its new speech-to-text feature called ""Captions"" can use machine learning to reproduce voice recordings so children can see the text that they're hearing. The text may not be a hundred percent accurate, Amazon warns, and is intended to be more an education aid than anything else, according to the company. This is supposed to legalize the textual reproduction notwithstanding the fact that it will in all probability impact sales of print and digital book sales, hurting authors and publishers. 

Of course, publishers, including Hachette, HarperCollins, Macmillan, Penguin Random House, Simon & Schuster, Chronicle Books and Scholastic don't agree with the thinking. So they and the Association of American Publishers, to which they subscribe, have sued Amazon in the Southern District Court of New York for copyright infringement.

 IRS Appeal in U.S. Tax Dispute 

Amazon won a 3-0 ruling in its favor at the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Seattle. The court upheld the 2017 U.S. tax court ruling against the IRS, represented by the Justice Department.

The case was in relation to the definition of intangibles that were transferred to its Luxemburg headquarters in Europe. Amazon claimed that the value was limited to independently transferable assets, while the IRS wanted to include things like goodwill, employees and ""culture of innovation.""

A 2017 amendment to the tax law does include these things, and would have enabled the IRS to increase the tax bill. But the judge held that since the increased scope of intangibles in 2017 did not apply to what Amazon transacted in 2005 and 2006, it couldn't be held liable.

2019-09-03 16:33:00,"ST. LOUIS, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve should cut interest rates by half a percentage point at its meeting in two weeks to get ahead of both financial market expectations for a rate cut and a global trade war that has become a broader ""reckoning"" over how the world economy is organized, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said in an interview on Tuesday.

Global investors have sent bond yields plummeting in recent weeks to record lows, leaving the Fed's overnight policy rate seemingly out of line, Bullard said.

Economic data on Tuesday meanwhile showed the U.S. manufacturing sector had contracted for the first time in three years amid slowing global economic growth and as China and the U.S. ratchet up tariffs on each other.

""We are too high,"" Bullard said of Fed interest rates, noting that the central bank's current target policy rate of between 2% and 2.25% was higher than the current yield of all U.S. Treasury securities. Typically the Fed's rate should form a baseline for the determination of other rates, but even the 30- year bond has dipped below 2%.

U.S. stocks slid on Tuesday, and benchmark Treasury yields hit their lowest in three years, as investors fretted that the drawn-out trade war was taking an increasing toll on the U.S. and global economy. European stocks also were down while safe-haven gold rallied.

RESPECTING THE SIGNAL

While central bankers often say they don't let financial markets dictate policy, ""in this situation I would respect the market signal,"" Bullard said. ""We should have a robust debate about moving 50 basis points at this meeting...It'd be better in my mind to go ahead and get realigned right now,"" rather than moving only a quarter point in September and again in October.

""Why do that? Why not just get to the right point today?""

Bullard's comments are the bluntest to date by a current voter on Fed policy endorsing deeper rate cuts in response to the wave of uncertainty touched off by rising tariffs, the sometimes whipsaw economic policy developments of recent months, and weak U.S. inflation.

Though the recommendation comes close to the sort of action President Donald Trump has demanded of the Fed, which he has accused of sabotaging his economic plans, Bullard's position is rooted in a dim view of where the trade debate is heading.

""This is an unraveling of the trade liberalization process that has been going on since World War Two"" and it could take ""a long time"" to sort out, Bullard said. ""To put it in a nutshell, politicians generally speaking do not want free trade,"" and in the case of the United States and China may see political advantage in appearing tough.

""The incentives are not all that great for either side to come to a deal.""

The Fed is widely expected to cut rates at its Sept. 17-18 meeting - investors see a quarter point reduction as likely, with one or two more to follow over the course of the year - but the decision is not clear cut.

Some current voters on the Fed's rate-setting committee see no need to lower interest rates with unemployment also at a record low and the economy continuing to grow.

In recent remarks Fed Chair Jerome Powell has indicated he is open to lowering rates again, but has not hinted at any particular timing or pace for doing so.

2019-09-03 09:08:00,"LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - A proposed high-speed rail project to improve links from London to central and northern England will cost about 20 billion pounds more than originally expected and is up to five years behind schedule, the government said on Tuesday.

The High Speed 2 project (HS2) aims to slash journey times between the capital and Birmingham, which supporters say would give Britain the kind of fast rail services enjoyed by other major countries.

A second phase envisages a new link from Birmingham to Manchester and Leeds in northern England.

In a statement to parliament, transport minister Grant Shapps said the scheme would not be delivered at the original budget of 62.4 billion pounds ($76.6 billion) but would instead cost 81-88 billion pounds.

The line was due to open in 2026 but the date has now been put back to 2028-2031 with the second phase launching between 2035 and 2040, potentially seven year late, Shapps said.

The government announced last month that it would hold an independent review into whether the scheme should go ahead, with a final report due by the end of the year.

""I want to be clear with colleagues that there is no future for a project like this without being transparent and open, so we will be candid when challenges emerge,"" Shapps said in his statement.

Opposition parties accused the government of incompetence.

""This government has misled both parliament and the public about the cost of HS2,"" said Labour transport spokesman Andy McDonald. ""People need to have confidence in the project, so this delay is bad news for the UK transport system as a whole and the north of England in particular.""","UK high-speed rail link is over budget, years behind schedule, government says - Nasdaq.com",https://www.nasdaq.com/article/uk-highspeed-rail-link-is-over-budget-years-behind-schedule-government-says-20190903-00750
2019-09-03 07:00:00,"BEIJING, Sept 3 (Reuters) - FedEx Corp  on Tuesday said it correctly handled a package containing restricted types of knives that was bound for Hong Kong after China's state-run Xinhua news agency, citing sources, said the package was suspected of being handled  illegally. 

Xinhua did not provide further details about the package, including itswould-be recipients. The agency said the items, which it described as ""controlled knives"", had been temporarily detained.

""The shipment in question was handled correctly via standard security protocol,"" FedEx said in a statement.

The Xinhua report was the latest in a series of allegations against the U.S. package delivery company by Chinese media and law enforcement, and comes amid tense relations between Washington and Beijing.

Xinhua reported in July that Chinese authorities investigating FedEx suspect the company illegally held back more than 100 Huawei Technologies Co Ltd  packages.

The United States in May placed the Chinese telecoms group on a blacklist that effectively blocks U.S. companies from doing business with it.

Police in southeast China'sFujian province launched an investigation last month after a FedEx parcel sent from the United States was found to contain a handgun. 

FedEx sued the U.S. government in June, saying it should not be held liable if it inadvertently shipped products that violated a Trump administration ban on exports to some Chinese companies.

2019-09-03 10:41:00,"By Lucia Mutikani

WASHINGTON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity contracted for the first time in three years in August, with new orders and hiring declining sharply as trade tensions weighed on business confidence, raising financial market fears of a recession.

Concerns about the economy, which is in its longest expansion ever, were also exacerbated by other data on Tuesday showing construction spending barely rising in July. The reports somewhat offset last week's upbeat data on consumer spending that had suggested that while the economy was slowing, it was not losing momentum as rapidly as financial markets were flagging.

""The canary in the mine may be falling off its perch,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""With manufacturing now starting to contract, it is even more critical that the consumer keeps spending.""

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity dropped to a reading of 49.1 last month from 51.2 in July. A reading below 50 indicates contraction in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for about 12% of the U.S. economy. Last month marked the first time since August 2016 that the index broke below the 50 threshold.

August's reading was also the lowest since January 2016 and was the fifth straight monthly decline in the index. The United States now joins the euro zone, Japan, the United Kingdom and China, which have long been experiencing a contraction in factory activity.

Still, the ISM index remains above the 43 level, which economists associate with a recession. The U.S.-China trade tensions also coincide with diminishing stimulus from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut package.

The ISM said there had been ""a notable decrease in business confidence,"" adding that ""trade remains the most significant issue, indicated by the strong contraction in new export orders."" Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the ISM index would slip to 51.0 in August.

The U.S.-China trade fight is eroding business sentiment, with business investment contracting in the second quarter for the first time in more than three years. That, together with an inventory bloat, is undercutting manufacturing, with output declining for two straight quarters.

Consumers have largely shrugged off the trade dispute and continued to spend, propping up the economy. But that could change with the trade war spilling over to shopping malls.

A new round of U.S. tariffs on imports of Chinese goods, mostly consumer products like clothing, footwear and televisions, took effect on Sept. 1. Additional U.S. tariffs are due to be imposed in December.

With trade tensions simmering in the background, the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates again this month to keep the economic expansion, now in its 11th year, on track.

The Fed lowered its short-term interest rate by 25 basis points in July for the first time since 2008, citing trade tensions and slowing global growth. Financial markets have fully priced in another quarter-percentage-point cut at the Fed's Sept. 17-18 policy meeting.

U.S. Treasury prices rose on the factory data, with the yield in the benchmark 10-year note dropping to its lowest since July 2016. The Treasury yield curve has inverted, signaling that a recession is looming. Stocks on Wall Street fell, while the dollar  was little changed against a basket of currencies. 

ORDERS TUMBLE

The ISM's forward-looking new orders sub-index dropped to a reading of 47.2 last month, the lowest level since June 2012, from 50.8 in July. A measure of export orders plunged 4.8 points to the lowest level since April 2009.

The survey's factory employment tumbled to 47.4, the weakest reading since March 2016, from 51.7 in July. This raises the risk that factory payrolls contracted in August. Manufacturers cut hours in July, pushing the factory workweek to its lowest level since November 2011. Factories also cut overtime in July.

The government will publish August's employment report on Friday.

""This (ISM) report is a warning that the tariff and trade uncertainty is continuing to weigh on manufacturing activity, and that this uncertainty is a growing risk to the expansion,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

The ISM said nine industries, including furniture and related products, machinery and chemical products reported growth last month. Transportation equipment, primary metals and electrical equipment, appliances and components were among the seven industries reporting a contraction.

Machinery manufacturers said ""business is starting to show signs of a broad slowdown."" Electrical equipment, appliances and components makers complained that ""tariffs continue to be a strain on the supply chain and the economy overall.""

That sentiment resonated across all industries.  Manufacturers of furniture and related products said ""incoming sales seem to be slowing down, and this is usually our busiest season.""

""The story up until now has been global manufacturing recession, with the U.S. standing out as the strongest among the weakening players,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York. ""The White House could help enormously by delaying further escalation of the trade conflict.""

In a separate report on Tuesday, the Commerce Department said construction spending edged up 0.1% in July. Data for June was revised up to show construction outlays decreasing 0.7 instead of falling 1.3% as previously reported.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending would rise 0.3% in July. Construction spending fell 2.7% on a year-on-year basis in July.

2019-09-03 11:45:00,"Given the stock's 100%-plus increase to date in 2019, investors had high expectations around Okta 's (NASDAQ: OKTA) second-quarter report. The digital identity management specialist raised its outlook in late May after posting surprisingly strong sales growth, especially among its high-value contracts.

Okta this past week again boosted that outlook after trouncing its latest sales targets. Investors who have been worried about its streak of net losses, meanwhile, could celebrate the fact that the cybersecurity software company is marching closer to the breakeven point. With those big-picture trends in mind, let's look at a few key takeaways from Okta's recen t earnings report.

The company reported sales of $141 million, representing 49% growth year over year. CEO Todd McKinnon and his team had predicted $131 million of sales and a 38% growth rate, and so the actual result was again far above expectations.

Image source: Getty Images.

Management credited its large-client niche for the speedy sales gains, with annual contracts valued at over $100,000 growing 46% to pass 1,200 companies. ""Our momentum is powered by the massive and inevitable shifts that are enveloping companies today,"" McKinnon said in a conference call .

Executives went on to note that Okta won several large new customers in the period thanks to its flexible platform of solutions that help manage identities in complex, cloud-based tech environments. These partnerships are getting bigger, too, with the top 25 contracts doubling in average size as compared to a year ago.

Okta achieved notable profitability wins, including higher gross and operating profit margin. Cash burn improved to $1 million, or 1% of revenue, compared to $5 million, or 6% of revenue a year ago. Operating loss landed at 31% of sales, compared with 41% last year.

The company is still firmly in growth investment mode, though, as those hefty losses demonstrate. Okta added 40% to its headcount, year-over-year, with most of the hires focused on areas like sales and marketing. Overall operating expenses rose to $145 million from $105 million, mainly thanks to its attempts to broaden its reach to larger enterprises. ""We continue to invest in our business as we scale for durable growth,"" CFO Bill Losch told investors.

Okta has the benefit of a robust sales outlook to support those aggressive spending plans. To that end, executives lifted their outlook for the second straight quarter and are now targeting fiscal-year sales of between $560 million and $563 million. That forecast stood at between $543 million and $548 million in late May and ranged from $530 million to $535 million at the start of the year.

Okta's non- GAAP (adjusted) earnings outlook is improving, too, but investors still aren't likely to see the software specialist earn a stable profit anytime soon. Non-GAAP net losses are on track to land at between $0.44 and $0.42 per share this year, compared with $0.32 per share last year.

Sure, it's usually a bad sign for investors to see a company's losses balloon higher. But, in this case, there's plenty of evidence supporting management's claim of strengthening its position in an industry that has a long runway for growth ahead. That success should lay the groundwork for significant profit generation, perhaps as early as fiscal 2020.

BRASILIA, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Industrial production in Brazil fell in July for a third month in a row, official figures showed on Tuesday, an unexpected decline that suggested the country's economic recovery might not be as solid as other recent data has indicated.

Industrial output fell 0.3% in July from June on a seasonally adjusted basis  and fell 2.5% from a year earlier on a non seasonally-adjusted basis , government statistics agency IBGE said.

The figures follow survey data for August which pointed to a firmer rebound in Brazilian manufacturing and industry. The IHS Markit manufacturing purchasing managers index for August, for example, hit a five-month high and posted its biggest month-on-month increase since March last year. 

""It's pretty bad, well below expectations. And bear in mind that there was a pretty strong contribution from the mining sector as iron ore output has started to recover,"" said William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics.

""The good news is that the surveys suggest August was better. But even so, it highlights that the recovery is very bumpy and makes a 50 basis point cut in interest rates later this month very likely,"" he said, referring to the central bank's next policy meeting on Sept. 17-18.

Output of intermediate goods fell 0.5% on the month and 5.4% on the year, IBGE said, the main driver of the overall decline. Production of capital goods fell 0.3% on the month, but rose 6.6% on the year.

Production of consumer, durable, semi-durable and non-durable goods all rose on the month and the year, IBGE said.

So far this year, industrial production is down 1.7% on the first seven months of last year, while the accumulated decline over the last 12 months is 1.3% compared with a year earlier.

Official figures last week showed that manufacturing and industrial production were major contributors to a surprisingly strong 0.4% expansion of gross domestic product in the second quarter.

2019-09-03 12:45:00,"Anyone who enjoys hitting a golf ball or two has heard of Topgolf , a leisure concept that blends the driving range with Las Vegas-style leisure and entertainment. Topgolf launched in the US in 2005, and has grown to include over 50 locations in the US and 41 venues worldwide, and its popularity is spurring a resurgence in golf brands.

Topgolf is making the sport accessible to new demographics and markets, thanks in part to Callaway Golf (NYSE: ELY) , which has helped the new entertainment concept boost its market position. A closer look at Callaway shows a company with a confident outlook buoyed by a growing market.

Image source: Getty Images

Interestingly, the World Golf Federation finds that 8.2 million of golf participants in 2016 never played on a golf course but visited ""alternative"" venues such as driving ranges. Overall, the combined count of those who participated in traditional golf and those hitting a golf ball at alternative venues reached 32 million, a figure that was 3% higher in 2016 than in 2015.

The growth in golf is also a result of a healthier economy as the effects of the 2008/2009 financial crisis are finally subsiding in the consumer market.

Unfortunately for entertainment investors, Topgolf is privately owned by the Joliffe brothers, and an IPO does not seem to be on the cards any time soon. Still, in 2006, the iconic golf brand Callaway become a leading investor in Topgolf  with a 14% stake and is now poised to hit the lottery in the event of a Topgolf IPO. Some estimates suggest that Topgolf could reach 1.8 billion in sales by 2020, up from $500 million in 2016, and Callaway's stake in Topgolf could be worth $600 million by 2020.

The Vegas-style environment of Topgolf blends nightclub cocktails with the latest in digital golf technology, a combination that the Millennial and Gen X-er crowd appreciate. Also, according to the 2018 National Golf Foundation's new Golf Industry Report, thanks to new golf concepts such as Topgolf, the sport is more accessible and appealing to women and minorities; 35% of new players are women and 25% are non-Caucasian.
 The appeal of Topgolf and the growth of golf in general is also propelling the athleisure fashion market, and Callaway is in on that too.

In January 2019, Callaway broadened its product line with the acquisition of the Germany-based Jack Wolfskin apparel brand for $476 million. The acquisition was confirmation of Callaway's push into the active lifestyle category after its successful 2017 acquisitions of outdoor gear and apparel companies TravisMathew and Ogio .

Some might consider the company's move into the outdoor clothing and equipment market a risk and a move too far removed from its core competency, but it fits with Callaway's broader strategy of targeting a younger and more global audience.

As for Callaway's recent financials, the company reported a total revenue increase in the second quarter 2019 of 12.72% year on year, which was above the average of its competitors. Sales growth at 4.37% was also above its competitors' average revenue growth recorded in the same quarter. Moreover, Callaway announced a stock buyback announcement of 5.9% per share and for the amount of $100 million in August, which could be indicator that the company feels undervalued by the market.

Although Callaway's share price has lagged that of competitors since it acquired the Jack Wolfskin brand, stock traded higher in June after hedge fund Jana Partners disclosed a 9.5% stake . Jana Partners is the second largest-shareholder of Callaway, and the expectation is that it might encourage divestment of non-core assets to improve the stock's underperformance.

Whatever influence Jana Partners might have on the future of Callaway, the golf brand looks set to gain from its current growth strategy. Callaway seems to be transforming itself from prey to predator at a time when there is plenty of prey to be had.

When Cronos Group (NASDAQ: CRON ) first announced its partnership with Altria (NYSE: MO ) last year, management discussed the various advantages that the company gained. Mentioned were Altria's proven expertise in brand management and product development, its ability to plan and capitalize on emerging market opportunities, and its research, development and technological capabilities.

Of course the biggest advantage was probably the huge cash infusion that Altria made into Cronos. Because of this, Cronos still has almost $1.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet.

This puts CRON stock in a strong position.

However, what Cronos' management didn't discuss is how this partnership effectively makes CRON stock a sin stock. If there ever was a sin stock, it's big MO. As one of the tens of millions of people who have seen loved ones die due to the effects of smoking, I have no problem expressing my belief that Altria, aka Philip Morris (NYSE: PM ), is an unethical company and I would never invest my personal funds in it.

But regardless of whether or not you share my beliefs, if you are interested in CRON stock this is something that you should be aware of. So-called sin stocks are stocks of companies that engage in what some people would consider immoral or unethical practices. This would include companies such as weapons makers and companies in the alcohol business. Of course, stocks involved in the production and sale of tobacco would also be included.

This is the issue that should concern shareholders. Some of the largest institutions with money managers are state and union pension plans. Religious and educational endowments also have money which needs to be managed. Many of these institutions are focusing greater attention on ESG - environmental, social and governance - concerns when developing their investment strategies.

ESG stands for environmental, social and governance. Institutions that are focusing on these concerns are considering not just the financials of a company when they perform their analysis. They are also considering the company's overall effect on the well being of society as part of the research process. Clearly, many of the business practices of Altria would not be acceptable to pass the ESG screening procedures that these institutions are implementing.

Because of this, many of these wealthy institutions will not be able to invest in CRON stock. This could put the company at a serious disadvantage against its competitors. If an institution wants to invest in the cannabis market, many of the other growers would be much more attractive to them because they aren't considered to be sin stocks or have ESG concerns. This will lower demand for CRON stock, making it harder for the stock price to rise.

CRON stock has trended lower since breaking support at the $14 level. There may be some support around the $10 level because it is where its lows were in December. It is also an important level psychologically.

At the time of this writing, Mark Putrino did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-03 12:55:17,"Five Below 's (NASDAQ: FIVE) second-quarter earnings report last week was mostly within expectations. Revenue was slightly lower than analysts expected, but the company squeaked pas t earnings estimates by $0.01. The stock price still jumped following the report, as investors were impressed with the retail chain's execution, especially its ability to raise prices to mitigate potential tariffs from the U.S.-China trade war.

Let's look at a few things management discussed during the conference call that have investors feeling more confident that Five Below can remain firmly in growth mode in spite of potential headwinds.

IMAGE SOURCE: FIVE BELOW.

Second-quarter sales were up 20% year over year -- within management's expectations and the level that growth stock investors want to see out of a richly valued company. However, comparable-sales growth clocked in lower than expectations at 1.4%. But the company delivered better-than-expected results where it counts, as adjusted earnings per share increased by 19% year over year.

Speaking to the strong performance on the bottom line, CEO Joel Anderson said, ""Strong new store performance enabled us to deliver earnings per share near the high end of our guidance range.""

Sales growth got a boost from the addition of four new stores that were opened ahead of plan during the quarter. The company is on track to open 150 new stores for the full year, which would bring the total store count to 900 by the end of 2019.

Given how profitable Five Below stores are within the first year, it makes sense for the company to keep opening stores at a steady pace. As Anderson explained, ""With an industry-leading less than one-year average payback on our new store investment, we continue to believe new stores are the best use of capital.""

As Five Below continues to map the country with stores, management is also investing in distribution centers, recently opening a new one to serve the southeast region of the company's footprint. The chain started the year with three distribution centers located in Mississippi, Georgia, and New Jersey to support the growth in the Southeast and Northeast, where most of the company's stores are located right now.

Investors can get a hint about where the company is looking to expand next by watching where it opens these distribution centers. Three new distribution centers are coming to Texas, the Midwest, and the West Coast. Long term, management believes they can expand the store footprint about three times larger than it is now.

Effective inventory management is part of Five Below's secret sauce of maintaining an industry-leading return on investment on its stores. Management likes to open new distribution centers in the early phase of store growth in a new region. This allows the company to respond to demand very quickly when traffic is high immediately following a new store opening.

The company is doubling down on supply-chain management with the formation of a new executive role. In the second quarter, Five Below announced it was hiring Rich Tannenbaum as the new senior vice president of supply chain. Tannenbaum has previous experience working at other national retailers, such as PetSmart and Vitamin Shoppe. During the call, Anderson said, ""This newly created position at Five Below shows our commitment to building a world-class supply chain.""

This commitment reflects Anderson's previous experience working as an executive at Walmart , which is known for its highly efficient inventory management. He wants to bring that level of efficiency to Five Below .

One of the benefits of increasing scale is the ability to source merchandise at volume to deliver better value to customers. Basically, the more Five Below grows, the better products the company can source from suppliers, which keeps shoppers coming back for the treasure hunt. The company has expanded from selling sporting goods, for example, for less than $5 to selling consumer electronics at the same low prices.

Five Below is testing its new 10 Below! category, including video games and spa items like neck massagers, all priced below $10. Anderson said, ""These represent items and categories we could not previously carry at Five Below and all that extreme value for our customers.""

The threat of tariffs has been a thorn in the side of Five Below this year, but the chain has proven resilient with its ability to raise prices. Management has designed the store experience to be a fun place to shop, where customers will be surprised at what they can buy for just a few dollars. What this means is that customers are not likely going to complain if they have to pay a little more for a Bluetooth speaker that is already a bargain at $5.

Five Below has been testing price increases on certain goods priced from $1 to $4, and the results have been favorable. Anderson said, ""Given continued positive results from the pricing tests we expect to roll out the pricing changes across the chain by the fourth quarter.""

Looking ahead, the combination of new store remodels, new licensed items based on 2019 films, such as Toy Story 4 and The Lion King , and the recent price increases should position Five Below for a strong finish to the year.

Management is calling for comp sales to increase in the range of 2% to 3% in the third quarter and 3% for the full year. Earnings per share are expected to be up 15.8% over 2018 at the low end of guidance, which includes the expected impact from tariffs.

2019-09-03 11:39:00,"BAMAKO, Sept 3 (Reuters) - At least eight people were killed in Mali when a makeshift bomb exploded under a passenger bus travelling in the violence-plagued central region of Mopti, the bus company said on Tuesday.

The vehicle hit the landmine while carrying 60 passengers through the Douentza territory in Mopti, where ethnic militias regularly slaughter civilians from rival groups and Islamist militants are also active.

""The blast killed several people and injured some more. The provisional death toll, I repeat provisional, is of eight people killed,"" said Mohamed Diakite, director of SONEF, the company operating the bus.

The remote border region where Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger meet has become a haven for jihadist militants, who often launch deadly attacks on the U.N., Malian and international troops. Improvised explosive devices (IED) have been commonly used.

A person at the scene told Reuters his sister and nephew had been on board the vehicle and were killed in the explosion.

At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AMT options chain for the new October 11th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.

Because the $232.50 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 55%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.37% return on the cash commitment, or 22.72% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost .

Considering the fact that the $235.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

On our website under the contract detail page for this contract , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.18% boost of extra return to the investor, or 20.96% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost .
