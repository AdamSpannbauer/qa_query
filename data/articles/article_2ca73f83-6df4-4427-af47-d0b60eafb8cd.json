    " It's no secret that debt can hurt your financial health and   make it harder to build wealth.   High-interest debt    , in particular, is especially toxic and can eat away at your   budget until you don't have any extra money to put toward your   retirement savings. As if it's not challenging enough to deal with debt while   you're trying to prepare for the future, if you're in deep, the   effects of this toxic debt can carry over into retirement. In   some cases, your Social Security benefits might even be withheld   if you're in arrears on certain types of loans.   Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();  More seniors are struggling with debt First, it's important to clarify that not all types of debt   will have an effect on your Social Security benefits. The   majority of creditors, such as credit card companies and loan   agencies, have no control over your benefits. But if you have   unpaid federal student loans, your benefits could be at risk. It's becoming more common for older Americans to carry student   loan debt, particularly as they help their adult children pay for   college. More than half (53%) of parents say that helping their   kids pay for college is more important than saving for their own   retirement, a   survey    from T. Rowe Price found. Nearly 3 million adults age 60 and   older carry student loan debt, according to a   report    from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and of that group,   the average borrower owes around $23,500. If you're able to pay off this debt, there's no harm in   financially helping your children. But many parents, especially   those nearing or already in retirement, are struggling to keep up   with loan payments and still pay the bills. Close to 40% of   borrowers age 65 and older with federal student loans are in   default, according to the CFPB, and they're more likely than   those without student loans to skip basic healthcare needs like   prescription medication and doctor's visits. Student loan debt can make it difficult to afford even basic   necessities, and it's no secret retirees need all the income they   can get. But sometimes student loans can even take a chunk out of   Social Security benefits, too. How student loan debt affects Social Security If you've defaulted on federal student loans, you may be   forced to give up a portion of your Social Security benefits to   pay them back. Typically, borrowers will see up to   15% of their benefits offset    to go toward student loans, according to the U.S. Government   Accountability Office. You won't see your benefits reduced after just one missed   payment; you'll need to be severely behind before the government   steps in. The GAO found most borrowers whose benefits were   reduced had held their student loans for decades, and roughly a   third were in default for five years before their Social Security   benefits were affected. While it's relatively unlikely your Social Security benefits   will be garnished because of student loan debt, it is becoming   more common. Approximately 114,000 borrowers age 50 and over had   their benefits offset because of student loans in 2015, according   to the GAO. The majority of those people were receiving Social   Security disability benefits, but it's possible for the   government to withhold retirement benefits as well. Losing Social Security benefits has the heaviest impact on   low-income beneficiaries. Approximately half of unmarried   retirees rely on Social Security   for at least 90% of their income    , according to the Social Security Administration, and seeing   benefits reduced by 15% to repay student loans could make it even   more difficult to make ends meet. In 2015, approximately 70,000   borrowers receiving Social Security benefits were living below   the poverty line, according to the GAO. Don't let student loans eat away at your benefits When you don't make a payment on your federal student loan for   at least 270 days, you're considered to be in default. Once   you've defaulted, the government will   try to get its money any way it can    -- whether it's by withholding your tax refunds, demanding that   your employer withhold your wages, or taking a chunk of your   Social Security benefits. Defaulting on your loans comes with a long list of other   consequences, too. For example, it's much more difficult to get   another loan, your credit score takes a significant hit, and you   might even have to go to court -- which, of course, comes with a   slew of legal expenses. To avoid any of these potential consequences, it's best to   avoid defaulting on your loans in the first place. If you're   struggling to make your payments, contact your lending   organization to see if you can come up with a mutual agreement   for paying the money back. FOr example, you might be able to   consolidate your loans or enroll in an income-driven repayment   plan. If you've already defaulted, loan rehabilitation may be an   option. When you rehabilitate a loan, you make a certain number   of payments in a certain time period in order to remove the   default status. Regardless of how you choose to manage your debt, it's   important to get it under control as soon as possible to avoid   major financial consequences. Failing to repay your debt will not   only impact your credit score and overall financial health, but   it can also hurt your chances at a comfortable retirement if you   can't rely as much on Social Security   benefits    . By paying off your debts on time, you can ensure your loans   won't affect your retirement income.   The $16,728 Social Security bonus most retirees     completely overlook       If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more)     behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of     little-known \"Social Security secrets\" could help ensure a     boost in your retirement income.
