    " What happened Shares of   Lovesac    (NASDAQ: LOVE) are up 15.4% as of 2:15 p.m. EDT Wednesday after   the specialty-furniture retailer announced better-than-expected   fiscal second-quarter 2020 results. More specifically, Lovesac's net sales soared 44.8% year over   year to $48.1 million, translating to an adjusted net loss of   $4.5 million, or $0.31 per share (narrowed from a $0.63-per-share   loss a year earlier). Most analysts were expecting a wider loss   of $0.50 per share on revenue of $47.7 million.   IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.makeArticleAd();  So what Lovesac's   top-line growth    was led by strength across its showroom, internet, and pop-up   shop sales. These venues were collectively fueled by successful   marketing campaigns that not only attracted new customers to the   brand, but also encouraged repeat purchases from existing   clients. Lovesac's comparable sales skyrocketed 40.7% in the   quarter, including a 31.8% increase from showrooms and 71.5%   growth from online sources. \"We are further strengthening our multi-channel model with the   addition\u00a0of productive new showrooms, the expansion of our   pop up shop business at   Costco    and the announcement of a brand new shop in shop pilot with   Macy's    that is expected to launch late in the third quarter, as well as   increasingly effective advertising and marketing strategies,\"   stated Lovesac CEO Shawn Nelson. Now what Lovesac also reiterated its outlook for full-fiscal-year 2020   growth of 40% to 45% and for positive full-year adjusted earnings   before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (   EBITDA    ). With that in mind, Lovesac also noted this reiterated guidance   includes the negative impact from   all    announced tariffs to date, which the company has managed to   mitigate through a combination of \"minor\" price increases and   reducing its manufacturing in China to just 44% of its total   (from 75% at the start of this year).   10 stocks we like better than The Lovesac     Company       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.
