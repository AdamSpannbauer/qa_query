    "In trading on Tuesday, shares of EQM Midstream Partners LP (Symbol: EQM) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $29.61 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.    In the case of EQM Midstream Partners LP, the RSI reading has hit 29.2 - by comparison, the universe of energy stocks covered by Energy Stock Channel  currently has an average RSI of 45.3, the RSI of WTI Crude Oil  is at 42.0, the RSI of Henry Hub Natural Gas  is presently 62.9, and the 3-2-1 Crack Spread  RSI is 22.8. A bullish investor could look at EQM's 29.2 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.
