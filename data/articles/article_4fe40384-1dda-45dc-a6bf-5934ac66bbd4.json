  "text": [
    " Developments in genomics have been rapidly altering the healthcare landscape by decoding the mysteries behind the function, structure, evolution, editing and mapping of genomes  . Accordingly, growing demand for personalized medicine, solid investments and higher R&D activities  will soon make genomics the next big thing in the investing space. In fact,\u00a0 going by a MarketsandMarkets report  , the $18.9-billion global genomics market is expected to reach $35.7 billion by 2024 at a CAGR of 13.5%. The report further states that North America accounted for the largest share of the global genomics market in 2018.  What's Favouring the Genomic Testing Space?  The global genomics market has been  favored by a streak of solid developments   in sequencing, microarray, PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction), Nucleic acid extraction and Purification techniques. Further, the implications of AI, cloud-based technologies and increased R&D focus have lent a competitive edge to the companies with significant exposure to genomics. Accordingly, the genomics market is seeing  decreasing sequencing costs and widening genomics-based applications. The genomics market  is also seeing a  ramp-up in government spending   with a huge number of start-ups entering the market.  Partnerships between research institutes and companies   are also opening up new growth opportunities  in the global genomics market. In March 2019, Illumina ILMN collaborated  with the Lundbeck Foundation GeoGenetics Centre at the\u00a0University of Copenhagen to study the relationship between the evolutionary history of certain mental and neurological disorders and infectious pathogens.\u00a0 Tremendous progress is being observed within the  gene editing space as well   . CRISPR  (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)/Cas9 gene editing is now being tested in early clinical trials for certain disorders like sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Huntington's disease. This development is taking place after six years of CRISPR technique's first application to animals  . However, a new advanced technique addressing the shortcomings of existing gene-editing platforms\u00a0 - SATI  (intercellular linearized Single homology Arm donor mediated intron-Targeting Integration) - has been developed by the scientists at the Salk Institute.
