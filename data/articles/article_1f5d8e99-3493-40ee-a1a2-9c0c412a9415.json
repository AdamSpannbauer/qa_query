    " What happened Shares of   Vera Bradley    (NASDAQ: VRA) fell 19.3% on Wednesday, after the luggage and   handbag specialist announced disappointing fiscal second-quarter   results. More specifically, Vera Bradley's quarterly revenue grew 5.4%   year over year to $119.8 million -- or up 0.7% to $114.4 million   if you exclude sales from its acquisition of Pura Vida in July --   translating to adjusted (non-GAAP) net income of $8.7 million, or   $0.25 per share. Both the top and bottom lines arrived near the   low ends of Vera Bradley's guidance, which called for earnings   per share of $0.25 to $0.28 on revenue (excluding Pura Vida)   ranging from $115 million to $120 million.   IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.makeArticleAd();  So what Vera Bradley's modest   top-line growth    came as a 2.1% increase in comparable sales -- which was in line   with guidance for a low-single-digit gain -- was partly offset by   the company's decision to reduce its year-over-year clearance   sales by roughly $3 million. \"Vera Bradley's comparable sales, full-price selling, and   customer count were once again up in the quarter, and we   successfully managed our expenses,\" CEO Rob Wallstrom said.   \"However, retail remains challenging particularly in the Indirect   channel as our partners continue to feel the pressure of a   difficult environment, and our total sales fell slightly below   our expectations.\" Wallstrom further noted that margins were pressured by higher   tariffs and shipping costs. Now what For the current fiscal third quarter, Vera Bradley told   investors to expect revenue ranging from $122 million to $129   million (including $23 million to $25 million from Pura Vida), up   from $97.7 million in the same year-ago period. That should   translate to earnings per share of $0.16 to $0.20, including   around $0.05 per share from Pura Vida. As such, Vera Bradley now sees full fiscal-year revenue of   $490 million to $505 million (including $65 million to $70   million from Pura Vida) -- which technically marks a modest   reduction based on the midpoint of its previous $425 million to   $440 million range, excluding Pura Vida.\u00a0 On the bottom   line, that should result in earnings per share of $0.86 to $0.93,   essentially a reiteration of its previous guidance before the   acquisition.   10 stocks we like better than Vera Bradley       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.
