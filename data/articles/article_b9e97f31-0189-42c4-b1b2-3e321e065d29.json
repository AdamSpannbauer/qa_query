    " Markets closed in the red on Tuesday after the manufacturing activity in the United States fell to its lowest level in the past three years. Further, a fresh round of tariffs was imposed by the United States and China on each other on Sep 1. Such developments led to broad based losses for the markets. The three major benchmarks ended in the negative territory. Markets remained closed on Monday due to Labor Day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average decreased 1.1%, to close at 26,118.02. The S&P 500 decreased 0.7% to close at 2,906.27. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,874.15, losing 1.1%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) decreased 3.2% to close at 18.38. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 2.10-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 2.80-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.  How Did the Benchmarks Perform?  The Dow shed 285.3 points to close in the red. Shares of 3M Company MMM  and Boeing BA  fell 1.9% and 2.7%, respectively and weighed on the 30-stock index. The S&P 500 fell 20.2 points to end in negative territory. Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, eight ended in the red, with industrials leading the decliners.

The reading not only came in below the consensus estimate of 51.3% but also fell to its lowest settlement since January 2016.
