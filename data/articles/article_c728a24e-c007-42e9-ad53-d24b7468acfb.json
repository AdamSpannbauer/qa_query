    " Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades. Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define.

Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for BTG that show why this gold, silver and copper miner shows promise as a solid momentum pick. A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area. For BTG, shares are up 1.7% over the past week while the Zacks Mining - Gold industry is up 0.22% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 2.58% compares favorably with the industry's 2.58% performance as well. While any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Shares of B2Gold have increased 30.18% over the past quarter, and have gained 54.31% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 6.44% and 2.13%, respectively. Investors should also pay attention to BTG's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. BTG is currently averaging 8,641,382 shares for the last 20 days.  Earnings Outlook  The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with BTG. Over the past two months, 7 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost BTG's consensus estimate, increasing from $0.16 to $0.20 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 8 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.  Bottom Line  Given these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that BTG is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A.
