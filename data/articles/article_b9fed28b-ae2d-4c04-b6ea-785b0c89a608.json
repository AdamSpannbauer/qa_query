Notably, Jockey International is the fifth retailer to enjoy occupancy of an abundantly-visible space in one of the premier centers in the United States for product testing and customers' interaction in a new format. Among the other retailers which recently announced the opening of their stores with Simon nationwide are Egg Baby, Clientele, Revtown USA, and Hope & Henry.

The transformational plans include addition of hotels, restaurants, residences and luxury stores.
