Quote      Cowen and Company Conference Update    At the Cowen and Company 12th Annual Global Transportation Conference held on Sep 4, Delta provided an upbeat outlook for not only the third quarter but the full year as well. On the back of strong demand for Delta's services and rising revenues, the company is hopeful about achieving its third-quarter earnings and revenue targets. For the September quarter, earnings (excluding special items) are anticipated between $2.10 and $2.40 per share (the mid-point of the guided range - $2.25 - is much higher than the year-ago reported figure of $1.8but tad lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.26). Meanwhile, total unit revenues on an adjusted basis, are estimated to increase 1.5-3.5%.    Additionally, the carrier is confident about registering 6-7% top-line growth and a 25% surge in earnings per share in 2019 besides generating solid margins. The company expects pre-tax income and operating cash flow of $6 billion and $8.5 billion, respectively, in the current year.
