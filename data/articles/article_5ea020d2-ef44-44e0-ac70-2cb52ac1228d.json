  "text": [
    " Have you been paying attention to shares of Brady (BRC)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 6.8% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $53.62 in the previous session. Brady has gained 22.5% since the start of the year compared to the 13.2% move for the Zacks Industrial Products sector and the 28.4% return for the Zacks Security and Safety Services industry.  What's Driving the Outperformance?  The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its las t earnings  report on September 6, 2019, Brady reported EPS of $0.68 versus consensus estimate of $0.61 while it missed the consensus revenue estimate by 1.59%. For the current fiscal year, Brady is expected to post earnings of $2.57 per share on $1.19 billion in revenues. This represents a 4.47% change in EPS on a 2.4% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $2.72 per share on $1.23 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 6.16% and 3.54%, respectively.  Valuation Metrics  Brady may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself. On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style. Brady has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A. In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 20.7X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 18.1X versus its peer group's average of 11.8X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 2.77. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.  Zacks Rank  We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Brady currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts. Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Brady fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Brady shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.     Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
