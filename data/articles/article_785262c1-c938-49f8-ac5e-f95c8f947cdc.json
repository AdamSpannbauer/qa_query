  "text": [
    "STOCKHOLM, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Germany'sZF Friedrichshafen [RIC:RIC:ZFF.UL] said on Thursday it would look to sell its 20% stake in brake systems maker Haldex  in a move which could break the ownership deadlock in the Swedish firm dating back to a bidding war in 2017.",
    "Car parts supplier ZF said in a statement it was making good progress with its new strategic focus in the commercial brakes area. \"As a result of this, ZF is considering options to divest its stake in Haldex AB, subject to market conditions,\" it said.",
    "Haldex was the target of a heated takeover battle between ZF and Knorr-Bremse  in 2016 and 2017 which failed to end up in a deal and left the two German firms jointly owning around a third of the company, complicating other potential bids.",
    "Haldex is the global number three in brake systems for commercial vehicles behind its far bigger rivals Knorr-Bremse and U.S. Wabco , which ZF agreed to buy earlier this year. "
