    "BEIRUT, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Lebanon is still considering the option of a new dollar debt sale and has not yet announced any issuance, Finance Minister Ali Hassan Khalil told Reuters on Thursday.",
    "Last week Khalil told a television talk show that one option in front of Lebanon for paying its debt obligations would be to issue $1.5-2 billion in dollar bonds.",
    "\"The ministry has not announced any issuance and has not taken any step yet regarding bonds,\" he told Reuters.",
    "\"We need now to sell more bonds in foreign currency that we will issue. The (central bank) governor and I will come up with a plan for how we can work on attracting part of that amount that could maybe be between $1.5-2 billion, to cover what will become due from previous issuances,\" he told a talk show on Lebanon'sMTV television a week ago.",
    "\"We have already agreed there will be a number of tools that complement each other. Within this are issuances at low interest rates, (and) a programme of issuing Eurobonds that we need from now to the end of the month,\" he said."
