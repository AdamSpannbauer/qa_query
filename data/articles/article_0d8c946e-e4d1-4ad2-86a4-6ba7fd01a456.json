With the new drives, Western Digital aims to reduce the total cost of ownership (or TCO) of data center customers.       Moreover, expanding portfolio with robust solutions instill confidence in the stock. Shares of Western Digital have returned 58.9% year to date, outperforming the industry  's rally of 9.7%.

Robust Features Hold Promise    SMR technology is touted to be an improvement over CMR technology, which is a key driver for Western Digital's latest 20TB drives, in particular.

The latest product roll out is in sync with the ongoing transition of data center customers from 14TB to 18TB and beyond.    Moreover, both 18TB and 20TB drives boast of MTBF (mean time between failures) of 2.5M hours and high power-efficiency functionalities. Robust sequential write and high-performance capabilities are anticipated to enable data center customers to manage complex data workloads seamlessly.    Per the company's estimates, by 2023, 50% of its HDD Exabyte shipments will be SMR technology driven. Moreover, per TRENDFOCUS data, \"14TB will continue to be the industry's dominant capacity point through the first half of 2020.\"    The aforementioned projections are expected to strengthen the company's competitive position in the storage market against Seagate STX  and other peers.   Growth Prospects Abound    Western Digital is investing heavily in order to deliver high-capacity storage devices that would support expansion of cloud infrastructure and cloud applications, which bode well given favorable market trends. In fact, per IDC data  , global spending on public cloud services and related infrastructure is envisioned to hit $210 billion in 2019, up 23.8% over 2018.    The expanded capacity is expected to increase demand for the HDDs among large enterprises, small and medium size businesses (SMBs) and creative professionals. The HDDs are capable of addressing growing storage needs amid huge influx of data generated by emerging technology and services like augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), high resolution.    Notably, per recent IDC estimates, the global datasphere  will grow to 175 zettabytes (that is a trillion gigabytes) by 2025, from 33 zettabytes in 2018. The effective storage is essential to properly harness this secular growth in data, which favors the prospects of Western Digital's latest solutions.
