  "text": [
    "  Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. RARE  and partner Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd., announced plans to submit a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to the FDA for the label expansion of Crysvita (burosumab). The sBLA will be submitted for the treatment of FGF23-related hypophosphatemia associated with phosphaturic mesenchymal tumors (tumor-induced osteomalacia; TIO) that cannot be curatively resected or localized. The company decided to \u00a0to submit the sBLA after completing a pre-sBLA meeting with the FDA and an agreement on the filing package. The submission of the sBLA is planned for the first half of 2020. The sBLA will be supported by data from two single-arm phase II studies - a 144-week phase II study in 14 adult patients conducted by Ultragenyx in the United States and an 88-week phase II study in 13 adult patients conducted by Kyowa Kirin in Japan and South Korea. In both studies, Crysvita was associated with increases in serum phosphorus and serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels. Increased phosphate levels led to improvements in osteomalacia, mobility, and vitality. Shares of the company have inched up 0.9% year to date against the\u00a0 industry  's decline of 1.9%.    Crysvita, an antibody targeting fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), is approved in the United States for the treatment of X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) in adult and pediatric patients.
