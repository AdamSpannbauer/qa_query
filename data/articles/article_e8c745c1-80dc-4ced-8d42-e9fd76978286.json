    " What happened Shares of Canadian-American   space-tech    company   Maxar Technologies    (NYSE: MAXR) leapt more than 19% by the close of trading   yesterday, and are up another 11% as of 12:45 p.m. EDT Wednesday.   With no new news to account for the jump, we're going to point   the finger once again at the source of yesterday's   excitement: J.P. Morgan, and its   high-risk/high-reward endorsement    of Maxar stock.   \"Hey, Houston! Did you hear what JPMorgan said about Maxar     stock yesterday?!\" Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();  So what To recap, yesterday J.P. Morgan initiated coverage of Maxar   stock with an \"overweight\" rating and a $12 price target. While   Maxar's currently unprofitable, J.P. Morgan has high hopes that   Maxar will   become    profitable thanks to a string of valuable space tech contracts   it's won from NASA and other customers -- including   a $375 million deal    to build the power and propulsion element spacecraft for NASA's   new lunar Gateway space station. J.P. Morgan predicts that when Maxar finishes restructuring   its business, building a new fleet of \"Legion\" digital imaging   satellites to replace its lost WorldView-4 satellite, and   executing on its NASA contracts, it will be on course to turn   free-cash-flow positive (and   GAAP    profitable) by 2021. It's rating the stock \"outperform\" now, to   beat the rush later on. Now what Highlighting the positive stock action yesterday (and today),   CNBC space analyst   Michael Sheetz    observed today on Twitter that \"I don't think space industry   folks realize how big a deal the JPM call was but the market   certainly seems to.\" The downside: With J.P. Morgan's endorsement or without it,   Maxar still has a $3.4 billion debt load to deal with. Until it   gets that debt paid off, the company's future will remain in   doubt, and its shifts in stock price could be just as dramatic as   what we've seen over the past two days -- shifts both up   and    down.   10 stocks we like better than Maxar Technologies     Ltd.
