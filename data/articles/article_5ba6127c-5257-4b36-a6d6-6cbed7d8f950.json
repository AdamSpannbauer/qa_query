    "The next rounds of strikes will be held on Sept. 18, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27 and 29, some of which will coincide with multi-day strikes by both pilots and cabin crew in Spain. ",
    "Ryanair flights to and from Britain ran as scheduled over the last three days during BALPA's latest strike, having also caused minimal disruption during the union's first walkout last month over a dispute over pay and conditions."
