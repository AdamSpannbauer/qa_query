    " What happened Shares of rare-disease drugmaker   Amicus Therapeutics    (NASDAQ: FOLD) shed 20% of their value in August,\u00a0according   to data from   S&P Global Market Intelligence    . And what caused investors to head for the exits last month?   Apparently, a question. On Aug. 8, Amicus released its second-quarter earnings report.   During the conference call that followed,   Bank of America    analyst   Tazeen Ahmad    noted that rival   Sanofi    's (NASDAQ: SNY) ongoing Phase 3 Pompe disease study for neoGAA   should read out ahead of Amicus' late-stage Pompe trial for   AT-GAA. The analyst also questioned whether the neoGAA study's   lung function primary endpoint might be viewed more favorably   among caregivers than AT-GAA's 6-minute walk test.

It's not   exactly breaking news that Sanofi's neoGAA program will deliver   its data almost a year ahead of AT-GAA's pivotal trial, after   all. What's important to keep in mind is that Amicus is aiming to   develop AT-GAA into the   gold standard    for Pompe disease. As such, the therapy's efficacy and safety   results will be paramount -- not how quickly they are   released. Now what Should investors take advantage of this dip? While Amicus'   shares now trade well below their 52-week high, the   biotech's stock    valuation remains in nosebleed territory at more than 20 times   the company's trailing 12-month sales. That's one of the richest   valuations in the entire healthcare sector at the moment. So   while it may seem like this double-digit percentage selloff has   provided investors with an attractive entry point, it might be a   good idea to take a cautious approach with this rare-disease   stock for the time being.   10 stocks we like better than Amicus     Therapeutics       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.
