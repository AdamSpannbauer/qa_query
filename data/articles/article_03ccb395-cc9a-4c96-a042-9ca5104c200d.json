Revenues in Detail  Revenues in the second quarter totaled $177.1 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.6%. Moreover, the top line surged 42.5% from the year-ago number and also exceeded the company's projected band of $160-165 million for second-quarter revenues.

However, gross margin of 65.7% contracted 33 basis points (bps) due to the impact of the highly automated US manufacturing line in Massachusetts that has just begun operations.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $683.3 million, near the upper end of the guided range. For the third quarter of 2019, Insulet expects revenues in the band of $174-181 million, indicating an approximate increase of 15-20% from the year-ago reported number.
