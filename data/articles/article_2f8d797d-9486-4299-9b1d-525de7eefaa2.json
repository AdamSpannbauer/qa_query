  "text": [
    "Sept 5 (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co  said on Thursday its blockbuster cancer immunotherapy, Opdivo, failed to meet the main goal of a late-stage trial testing it in patients with a type of tumor that affects the brain and spine.",
    "The drug, when used along with the current standard of care for the tumor called glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), did not prevent the cancer from progressing when compared to the standard of care alone, Bristol-Myers said. ",
    "A data monitoring committee has recommended the trial continue as planned to evaluate the other goal of extending survival.",
    "The company, which is buying Celgene Corp  for $64 billion, in May said Opdivo had failed to extend survival in another GBM trial. ",
    "Bristol-Myers has been seeking to expand the use of its cancer treatment Opdivo, its growth driver whose sales lag that of rival Merck & Co Inc's  Keytruda. Opdivo brought in worldwide revenue of $1.82 billion in the three months ended June 30.",
    "Glioblastoma multiforme is the most aggressive type of primary malignant tumor of the central nervous system and the standard of care can include radiation and chemotherapy."
