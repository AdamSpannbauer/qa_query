    "The company's Asia Pacific unit has resumed its application for the listing of a minority stake of its shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, it said on Thursday, adding no assurance can be given on whether the transaction will be completed.",
    "AB InBev, the world's largest brewer, was aiming to sell as much as $9.8 billion in Budweiser stock to seek relief from its heavy debt burden before pulling out of the planned listing in July. ",
    "The development comes after Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd  unveiled a $39 billion takeover approach to the London Stock Exchange Plc  on Wednesday that received a cool response from investors concerned about its regulatory and financial hurdles. "
