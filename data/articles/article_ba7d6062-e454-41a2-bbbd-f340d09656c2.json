    "Sept 5 (Reuters) - Thousands of Yahoo email users took to Twitter on Thursday to complain that the internet company's services have been unavailable for more than six hours.",
    "Users in Spain, France and Germany were the worst hit, according to outage tracker website Downdetector",
    "Yahoo said in a series of tweets that it was working to address the issue. \"We understand how difficult this must be for you. We are working especially hard to fix this,\" Yahoo tweeted.",
    "Yahoo, founded in 1995, once ran the most popular email service and was visited by hundreds of millions of users, but steadily lost out to Alphabet Inc's  Gmail.",
    "Yahoo's services include email, search engine and a news service. The company had rejected a $45 billion buyout offer from Microsoft  in 2008, only to sell its core business for $4.48 billion to Verizon Communications Inc  in 2017.",
    "Verizon combined the business with AOL to form a venture called Oath. Verizon shares were marginally up in morning trade."
