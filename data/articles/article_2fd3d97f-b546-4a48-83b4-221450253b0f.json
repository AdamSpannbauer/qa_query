    "The Toronto-based company has been fighting a tough retail environment as e-commerce behemoth Amazon.com Inc  and other department stores such as Macy's  and Nordstrom Inc  continue to swoop up more customers with discounts.",
    "\"The promotional activity in luxury was exceptionally intense in the second quarter and a notable change from the first quarter\", Chief Executive Officer Helena Foulkes said.",
    "Retail sales at the company fell marginally to C$1.83 billion from a year earlier.",
    "Over the past few years Hudson's Bay has been closing stores and selling businesses to sustain business. Last month, it said it would sell its Lord + Taylor department store business to fashion rental service company Le Tote Inc for about $100 million.",
    "The company's net loss from continuing operations widened to C$462 million, or C$2.51 per share in the quarter ended Aug. 3, from C$104 million, or 58 Canadian cents a year earlier. ",
