Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recen t earnings report  in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.

The company's earnings in the year-ago quarter include 26 cents gain from an asset sale. Total revenues of $5,305 million missed the consensus mark of $5,531 million. The top line also declined 2% on a year-over-year basis.  RevPAR & Margins  In the quarter under review, RevPAR for worldwide comparable system-wide properties increased 1.2% in constant dollars (down 0.3% in actual dollars) driven by a 1.1% improvement in average daily rate (ADR).
