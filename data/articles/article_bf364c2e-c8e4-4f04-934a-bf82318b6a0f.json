    " What happened Shares of   VMware    (NYSE: VMW) \u00a0fell 18.9% in August, according to data from   S&P Global Market Intelligence    , after the cloud-computing and virtualization company announced   strong quarterly results    \u00a0and also unveiled two aggressive acquisitions. VMware stock dropped nearly 10% on Aug. 23, 2019 alone -- the   first trading day after its second-quarter update hit the wires.   Revenue climbed 12.2% year over year to $2.44 billion,   translating to a more modest 3.9% increase in adjusted earnings   to $1.60 per share. Analysts, on average, were looking for lower   earnings of $1.55 per share on revenue closer to $2.40   billion.   IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.makeArticleAd();  So what VMware CFO Zane Rowe called it a \"strong financial   performance,\" citing   broad growth    across each of its key geographies. But the market was less pleased about VMware's two separately   announced acquisitions, including a   $2.7 billion deal    \u00a0for cloud-native platform company   Pivotal Software    (NYSE: PVTL) \u00a0and a   $2.1 billion agreement    to purchase cloud-native endpoint protection leader   Carbon Black    (NASDAQ: CBLK) . \"These acquisitions address two critical technology priorities   of all businesses today -- building modern, enterprise-grade   applications and protecting enterprise workloads and clients,\"   elaborated VMware CEO Pat Gelsinger. \"With these actions we   meaningfully accelerate our subscription and   [software-as-a-service] offerings and expand our ability to   enable our customers' digital transformation.\" Now what VMware also reiterated its full-fiscal-year target for revenue   of $10.03 billion, or growth of 11.8% year over year, which   should translate to adjusted earnings of $6.54 per   share.\u00a0Still, investors are clearly worried the   acquisitions' combined enterprise value of nearly $5 billion is a   big pill for VMware to swallow -- even with its own market   capitalization sitting north of $60 billion as of this   writing. Until the company can show more tangible progress of its   acquisitive strategy yielding fruit, I suspect VMware stock will   remain under pressure.   10 stocks we like better than VMware       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,     Motley Fool Stock Advisor      , has quadrupled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the     ten best stocks      for investors to buy right now... and VMware wasn't one of     them!
