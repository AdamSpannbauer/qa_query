Seagate ended the last-reported quarter with a long-term debt (including current portion) of $4.25 billion down from $4.52 billion reported in the previous quarter.    The latest debt-restructuring initiatives with cash tender offers are expected to aid its subsidiary company to manage debt well.    Seagate's cash flow and free cash flow generation bode well. Notably, in the fourth quarter, cash from operations was $448 million, up from $438 million reported in the previous quarter. Free cash flow for the quarter amounted to $297 million, up from $291 million reported in the prior quarter.

Notably, Seagate's board of directors approved a cash dividend of 63 cents per share payable Oct 9, 2019.   To Conclude    Seagate is benefiting from increasing traction for mass storage solutions across its edge and enterprise end markets. Moreover, synergies from acquisitions and product innovations remain a tailwind.    However, stiff competition in the disk drive market from Western Digital WDC  and drastic pricing pressure owing to supply/demand volatility remain headwinds.
