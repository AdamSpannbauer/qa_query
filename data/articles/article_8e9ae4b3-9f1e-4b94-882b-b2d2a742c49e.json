    "Biosimilars are versions of biologic medicines that have been developed and proven to be highly similar to the original biologic. They usually offer high-quality, lower-cost alternatives to biologic medicines.\u00a0Pfizer\u00a0( PFE  ) \u00a0has been focused on developing biosimilars of late. In fact, it has received U.S. FDA approvals for biosimilars to some of the blockbuster drugs, such as Herceptin, Rituxan, Avastin, and Remicade.\u00a0The combined peak sales of these biosimilars could be close to $6 billion in our view.\u00a0 Pfizer has agreed to merge its Consumer Healthcare business with GlaxoSmithKline's to form a new company, and similarly its Upjohn business to merge with Mylan's generic drugs business to form a new company, and Pfizer will own a stake in the new ventures.\u00a0After these deals are closed, Pfizer will be left with its BioPharma segment, which includes biosimilars, and they will account for more than 10% of the company's total sales, in our view. \u00a0You can view our interactive dashboard analysis ~  How Big Can Biosimilars Be For Pfizer?   ~ for more details.\u00a0 In addition, you can see more of\u00a0our data for Healthcare companies\u00a0here.
