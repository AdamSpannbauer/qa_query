  "text": [
    "  Baxter International Inc. BAX  entered a definitive agreement to acquire Cheetah Medical. The acquisition is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2019, subject to customary closing conditions. Baxter expects the deal to remain neutral to its earnings in 2019 and 2020.  makeArticleAd();  The deal is expected to replace the one-size-fits-all approach of fluid administration to a more data-driven process, catering to patients' customized need. With this deal, Baxter expects to strengthen its foothold in the specialized patient monitoring arena, with key technology used to guide fluid management.   Rationale Behind the Deal    Baxter is acquiring Cheetah Medical for an upfront cash payment of $190 million and potential payment of an additional $40 million, based on clinical and commercial achievements. Cheetah Medical's technology is expected to serve as a basic component of an innovative platform of specialized patient monitoring technologies, which is currently under development. The platform will join Baxter's other offerings - IV infusion pumps, IV fluids and medications - as part of an integrated system designed to aid and inform remedial decisions.        With the completion of the deal, Cheetah Medical's non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring systems, including the latest Starling SV system, will be included in Baxter's portfolio. These will help clinicians to take better note of the suitable amount of fluid for maintaining organ and tissue perfusion.    Baxter believes that this acquisition will help strengthen its commitment toward improving medical outcomes with an established patient monitoring technology to better inform and guide medical professionals with treatment decisions.    Given innovations and monitoring technologies of Cheetah Medical, this deal has come at just the right time for Baxter, which aims to leverage this for additional growth.
