Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is KLA-Tencor due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recen t earnings report  in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.  KLA-Tencor Beats Earnings and Revenue Estimates in   Q4  KLA-Tencor Corporation reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2019 earnings per share of $1.78, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7 cents. The figure was down 19.8% year over year and 1.1% sequentially. Revenues increased 17.6% from the year-ago quarter to $1.26 billion, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.25 billion. The figure was within the company's guided range of $1.21-$1.29 billion. Management continues to expect overall process control intensity to grow this year, driven by the expanding value of inspection and measurement in addressing critical customer problems, along with semiconductor industry expansion in China. Foundry and logic is expected to continue performing well through the second half of 2019 and in 2020. The optimistic view is driven by next-generation technology development, capacity additions at leading-edge nodes, increasing competitive dynamics and investment in EUV infrastructure. However, memory weakness will likely continue to impact customers' caution toward equipment investment plans. Management continues to expect WFE to be down in 2019, largely due to weaker DRAM demand.  Top-Line Details  Products revenues (accounting for almost 73% of the total revenues) increased 9.2% year over year to $917.6 million. Services revenues (27% of total revenues) increased 48.5% from the year-ago quarter to $340.8 million.

Specialty semiconductor processes, others (including solar, instruments and the KLA pro mature products enhancements business) and Service contributed 4%, 4% and 27% to revenues, respectively. KLA Tencor continues to experience strong growth for Wafer Inspection solutions. Management stated that new capacity addition by Wafer manufacturers and the adoption of more complex architectures by IC customers are driving demand for new bare wafer products. These are needed to support more stringent wafer flatness and process tool cleanliness specifications in advanced technologies.  Shipments in Detail  Shipments in the fiscal fourth quarter were $1.354 billion, increasing sequentially and exceeding the company's guided range of $1.235-$1.315 billion.
