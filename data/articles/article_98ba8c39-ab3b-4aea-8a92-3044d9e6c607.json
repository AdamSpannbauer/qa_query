    "(New York)",
    "It has been for around a decade that value stocks have been     getting hammered by growth stocks. The rut has been so bad that     many have given up on the discipline altogether. But recently,     something has been changing. Momentum stocks, long the darling     of this bull market, have started to lag their value-oriented     peers. This change started last week and is continuing today,     and follows the worst month for value stocks in at least 20     years (this past August).",
    " FINSUM      :     This is an encouraging sign, but certainly is not enough to     say \"value stocks are back!\". ",
