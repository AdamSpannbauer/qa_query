    "For the last half decade or so, financial advisors across     the industry have been on an endless search for the next     frontier of advice that will insulate their business from     cheap, digital competitors. This has led to a wide array of new     services, but one that is increasingly pervasive is college     counseling. Many advisors are now taking a much more active     role in college planning for the children of clients. This     includes everything from figuring out how to shelter certain     assets from financial aid forms (e.g. insurance products) to     actually proofreading applications and helping children choose     majors and study abroad programs. Demand for the service has     been rising since the cost of tuition has exploded, meaning it     represents a much larger financial burden than ever before.",
    " FINSUM      :     Some of this seems to make a lot of sense (e.g. making     financial plans to pay for college and help with financial aid     forms), but having financial advisors help kids choose majors     seems a little odd. That said, this seems like a good growth     area for the business. ",
