  "text": [
    "  Bruker Corporation BRKR  recently introduced the\u00a0NanoWizard\u00a04 XP\u00a0extreme performance Bio-AFM system. The new system is the result of the integration of Bruker's exclusive\u00a0PeakForce Tapping, which ensures both superior force control and unique AFM ease of use, and the pioneering\u00a0QI mode\u00a0for high-resolution nanomechanics on soft samples. With the launch of this new system, the company has established a performance yardstick for atomic force microscopy in the field of life science research. This system will expand Bruker's JPK BioAFM\u00a0business' portfolio under its NANO segment. Bruker acquired JPK in July 2018 to incorporate the latter's expertise in live-cell imaging, cellular mechanics and biological stimulus-response classification into the former's global infrastructure.     More About the JPK NanoWizard\u00a04 XP\u00a0  Using JPK's groundbreaking role in fusing AFM with state-of-the-art optical techniques, the\u00a0NanoWizard 4 XP\u00a0system provides the most superior \u00a0level of correlative microscopy and effortless integration with phase, DIC, confocal or spinning disc microscopies, single-molecule methods (FRET, FCS, TIRF, FLIM, FRAP), super-resolution techniques (STED, PALM/STORM, SIM), Raman, and multiphoton microscopy. The PeakForce Tapping is\u00a0an efficient way of attaining high-resolution AFM on a variety of biological samples. In addition to\u00a0PeakForce Tapping\u00a0and\u00a0QI mode, the\u00a0NanoWizard 4 XP\u00a0builds on JPK's next-generation\u00a0 Vortis 2  \u00a0high-speed, high-performance control electronics. The system also uses a path-breaking, new, workflow-based software, GUI, which comprises features like guidance, auto-setup and workspace organization to enhance productivity and deliver swift results. Equipped with the widest array of accessories, the NanoWizard 4 XP\u00a0is the most versatile Bio-AFM system in the market, as it offers remarkable flexibility for novel applications and experiments.  Recent Product Launches  Lately, Bruker has been focused on expanding its product portfolio. In June 2019, the company launched the\u00a0MALDI Biotyper sirius\u00a0system for all previously FDA-approved and research-use-only (RUO)\u00a0MALDI Biotyper (MBT)\u00a0reference libraries, which are used for swift and cost-efficient microbial identification from cultures in microbiology. \u00a0 In May, Bruker launched the\u00a0timsTOF fleX\u00a0mass spectrometer, which constitutes of a software-switchable MALDI source, adapted to the ESI\u00a0timsTOF Pro\u00a0platform.\u00a0  Price Performance  Shares of the company have rallied 22.6% in the past year against the industry  's\u00a02.9%. rise.  Zacks Rank and Stocks Worth a Look  Bruker currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Medtronic MDT  , Baxter BAX  and NuVasive NUVA  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see\u00a0  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here   . Medtronic's long-term earnings growth rate is expected to be 7.13%. Baxter's long-term earnings growth rate is projected at 12.8%. NuVasive's long-term earnings growth rate is expected to be 12.75%.  Legalizing THIS Could Be Even Bigger than   Marijuana  Americans spend an estimated $150 billion in this industry every year\u2026 more than twice as much as they spend on marijuana. Now that 8 states have fully-legalized it (with several more states following close behind), Zacks has identified 5 stocks that could soar in response to the powerful demand. One industry insider described the future as \"mind-blowing\" - and early investors can still get in ahead of the surge.
