    " Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn't want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value? One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let's put Caterpillar Inc. CAT   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:  PE Ratio  A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar o f earnings  in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock's current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole. On this front, Caterpillar has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11.65, as you can see in the chart below:      This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 18.35. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Caterpillar's current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years.      Further, the stock's PE compares favorably with the Zacks Industrial Products sector's trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 16.03. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.\u00a0      We should also point out that Caterpillar has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year's earnings) of just 10.85, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for  Caterpillar stock  in the near term too.  P/S Ratio  Another key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock's price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.\u00a0 Right now, Caterpillar has a P/S ratio of about 1.34. This is lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.23 right now.\u00a0 Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.\u00a0      If anything, CAT is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading-at least compared to historical norms.\u00a0  Broad Value Outlook  In aggregate, Caterpillar currently has a Zacks Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Caterpillar a solid choice for value investors.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  What About the Stock Overall?\u00a0\u00a0  Though Caterpillar might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of C. This gives CAT a Zacks VGM score - or its overarching fundamental grade - of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >> )\u00a0  Meanwhile, the company's recen t earnings  estimates have been disappointing. The current quarter has seen seven estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to no movement in the opposite direction while the current year estimate has seen twelve downward revision compared to no upward in the same time period.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This has had a negative impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased by 6.2% in the past two months, while the current year estimate has declined by 3.9%.

Price and Consensus          Caterpillar Inc. price-consensus-chart    |   Caterpillar Inc. Quote   Despite the bearish analyst sentiments, the stock holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Thus, we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.  Bottom Line\u00a0  Caterpillar is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible line up of statistics on this front. \u00a0 However, with a sluggish industry rank (among bottom 22% of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the Zacks Manufacturing - Construction and Mining industry has clearly underperformed the market at large, as you can see below:      So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.
