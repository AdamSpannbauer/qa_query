    "  For Immediate Release  Chicago, IL -September 3, 2019 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: AGCO Corp. AGCO  , Alphabet Inc. GOOGL  , KLA Corp. KLAC  and Microsoft Corp. MSFT  .  Here are highlights from Friday's Analyst Blog:    4 Best Stocks to Buy as Trade Tensions Abate   U.S. stocks posted strong gains in the last couple of trading sessions, mostly because China indicated that it won't react to the recent U.S. tariffs immediately. Ministry of Commerce spokesman Gao Feng confirmed that it is time to discuss measures to remove tariffs to prevent an escalation in the trade war. Lest we forget, troubles began after China announced plans of imposing new tariffs of 5% to 10% on nearly $75 billion of U.S. products. Beijing clarified that the move in reaction to the Trump administration's intention to impose 10% tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese imports. Trump, in the meantime, acted in response to China's decision by saying that the United States will increase tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods to 30% from an earlier 25%. And tariffs on additional $300 billion imports from China would go up to 15% from 10%. Nonetheless, a possible indication of a truce between two of the world's largest economies has alleviated risks in the equity market for now. A full-blown trade war would have had rippling effects on the global economy growth, casting a pall over businesses. Let us now look at stocks that have benefitted from the easing trade tensions:  Potential Winners as China Tamps Down Trade War   Escalation  As mentioned earlier, progress in trade talks has helped the Dow components, especially Boeing. After all, the aerospace giant sells about a fourth of its commercial aircraft to Chinese customers. And how can we forget that China had threatened to impose tariffs on several American products, including airplanes if there is no trade truce. Such a move could easily affect Boeing's 737-800, 737-700 and 737-900 ER models. But, with tariff scares behind us for now, Boeing has ample reasons to rejoice. Within the Dow, Intel in particular is expected to gain immensely. This is because Intel more or less generates bulk of its revenues from China, and it's more than what the semiconductor company makes in the United States. China, in fact, relies heavily on U.S. chipmakers, while semiconductors make up one of its largest import categories in terms of value. Hopes of abatement in U.S.-China trade tensions provided strength to the chip sector. To top it, China's latest plan to spur economic growth will surely boost semiconductor stocks, especially those in the region, in the near term as well. China is expecting to roll out a plan to improve disposable income this year. The broader tech sector has also a lot to gain from reduced trade war fears. The components of the SPDR Technology Select Sector had seen significant amount of revenues coming from China in recent years. In fact, China is in the second place in terms of revenue generation, behind the United States.  4 Top Picks  As trade war worries dissipate and broader markets move north, investing in stocks from the aforesaid sectors which are making the most of the recovery seems judicious. We have, thus, selected four stocks that can make the most of the encouraging trend. These stocks also flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).
