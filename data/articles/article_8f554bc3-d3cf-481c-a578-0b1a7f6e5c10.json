  "text": [
    " Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock. That's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss. However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores  system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks. Our proprietary system currently recommends Epam (EPAM) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank. Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better. While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this information technology services provider is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:  Earnings Growth  Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digi t earnings  growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration. While the historical EPS growth rate for Epam is 25.5%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 20.8% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 7.9%.  Cash Flow Growth  While cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds. Right now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Epam is 39%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 5.5%. While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 26.6% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 15.2%.  Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions  Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Epam. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1.3% over the past month.  Bottom Line  Epam has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.
