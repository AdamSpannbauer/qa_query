The stock is down 32% in 2019 through Sept. 3. For context, shares of main rival   Stratasys    declined 14.6% in August, so it was a bad month for the leading   pure-play   3D printing stocks    .

Adjusted for   one-time items, the South Carolina-based company's bottom line   came in at breakeven, down from $0.06 in the year-ago   period.\u00a0Wall Street analysts had been\u00a0looking for an   adjusted loss of $0.04 per share on revenue of $160.7 million.
