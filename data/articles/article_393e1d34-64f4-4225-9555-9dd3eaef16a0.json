  "text": [
    "  Infinity Pharmaceuticals Inc. INFI  has announced the initiation of two studies for its lead pipeline candidate-IPI-549, a first-in-class, oral immuno-oncology product candidate that selectively inhibits phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)-gamma. Shares of the company have increased 2.6% compared with the industry  's growth of 6.5%.    The company initiated a phase II, MARIO-3 study\u00a0in collaboration with\u00a0Roche AG RHHBY  , evaluating IPI-549 in combination with Tecentriq\u00a0and Abraxane\u00a0(nab-paclitaxel) in front-line triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), and in combination with Tecentriq. We note that, the combination of Tecentriq plus Abraxane is approved for TNBC. MARIO-3 is evaluating the addition of PI-549 to this regimen in both PDL1+ and PDL1- front-line TNBC patients.\u00a0 MARIO-3 also includes a cohort evaluating IPI-549 in combination with Tecentriq and Avastin\u00a0(bevacizumab) in front-line PDL1+ and PDL1- renal cell cancer (RCC) patients. Separately,\u00a0Arcus Biosciences RCUS  \u00a0has initiated a phase I/Ib study, in collaboration with Infinity, evaluating IPI-549 in a combination regimen with AB298, Arcus's dual adenosine receptor antagonist, and Doxil, a chemotherapy, in patients with advanced TNBC. By partnering with leading pharmaceutical and biotech companies, Infinity is evaluating IPI-549 for various diseases. \u00a0The company\u00a0has a collaboration agreement with Bristol Myers BMY  \u00a0to evaluate its lead pipeline candidate IPI-549 with the latter's\u00a0PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, Opdivo, in patients with advanced solid tumors. The company expects to complete enrollment in the second half of 2019 in the expanded combination cohorts in MARIO-1, an ongoing phase I/Ib\u00a0study of IPI-549 as a monotherapy, and in combination with Opdivo in approximately 220 patients with advanced solid tumors.
