  "text": [
    "  Applied Materials'   ( AMAT  ) stock has risen almost 3x over the past 4 years from $16.10 in August 2015 to $47.50 in August 2019. This rise was primarily driven by a sharp increase in revenue and net income margin, along with a drop in shares outstanding, which has pushed up earnings per share. We expect this growth to slow down going into late 2019, with a decrease in display and memory unit demand.",
