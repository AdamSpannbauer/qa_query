    " Per the lates t report  from the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) on Sep 5, its service index came in at 56.4% in August, surpassing the consensus estimate of 54.2%. Further, the rise in the index follows a three-year low of 53.7% it had witnessed in July. A reading above 50% indicates that the non-manufacturing sector economy is generally expanding. An improvement in the metric indicates that America's economy has remained resilient to global economic slowdown and effects of a protracted trade war with China. Gains were broad-based and occurred in 16 out of the total 17 industries that were surveyed. Under such circumstances, investing in mutual funds having significant exposure to services-related companies may prove prudent.  ISM Services Index Hits 3-Month High  The service side of America's economy hit its fastest pace of growth in the past three months. As a matter of fact, service-oriented businesses remained strong in August, improving for 115 consecutive months. It should be noted that a reading for the non-manufacturing index above 48.6% over time indicates that the overall economy is expanding. Moreover, the reading for August also states that the overall economy has expanded for 121 consecutive months. Furthermore, the Non-Manufacturing Business Activity Indexsurged to 61.5% in the month of August, posting growth for 121 months on the trot. Also, the Prices Index grew to 58.2% in the month. Moreover, ISM's Non-Manufacturing New Orders Index increased to 60.3% in the month, compared to the July reading of 54.1%. Meanwhile, new orders grew for the 121st consecutive month in August.  3 Best Choices  We have, thus, selected three mutual funds carrying a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) that are great for a retirement portfolio.
