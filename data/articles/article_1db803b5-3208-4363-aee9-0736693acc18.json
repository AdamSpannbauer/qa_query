    " A prudent investment decision involves buying stocks that have solid prospects and selling those that carry risks. At times, it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions. We believe H&R Block, Inc. HRB  with long-term expected EPS growth rate of 10% and a market cap of $4.9 billion is one such stock and investors should retain it in their portfolios.  Factors That Bode Well  The U.S. government's tax reform that led to lower tax rates and simpler codes reduced the demand for H&R Block's assisted tax preparation services. The business suffered post tax reform, leaving an adverse impact on the stock price, which has declined 5.9% in a year.    Currently, management expects betterment in the tax business, which along with contribution from the acquisition of Wave Financial, is expected to help the company grow its top line by 1.5% to 3.5% in the current fiscal year. The Wave Acquisition has expanded H&R Block's product and client portfolio and strengthened its position in the large and expanding small business market. Additionally, cost reductions are expected to offset operating losses from Wave acquisition, thus positively impacting margin. Expansion of digital offerings in new areas is helping the company to attract and retain new clients, positively impacting earnings growth.

Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Zacks\u00a0 Business Services  \u00a0sector include Fiserv FISV  , Booz Allen Hamilton BAH  and Charles River Associates CRAI  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).
