    "(New York)",
    "Investors tend to go to the same old ports to ride out the storm of a recession-gold, Treasuries, healthcare, utilities etc. However, finding a new safe haven can be not only the means to good protection, but also solid capital appreciation. With that in mind here is a very unglamorous, but potentially lucrative idea-buy garbage stocks. We don't mean bad stocks, we mean stocks of solid waste companies, like Waste Management, Waste Connections, and Casella Waste Systems. Garbage companies are highly recession tolerant (it is not as if there is less garbage), and they tend to throw off huge amounts of free cash flow. Michael Hoffman, an analyst at Stifel is recommending these shares.",
    "FINSUM : This seems like a very good recession hedge. Garbage is a very durable sector. Will this be the next recession star?",
