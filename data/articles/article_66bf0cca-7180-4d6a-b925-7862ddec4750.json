    " There are some   retirement expenses    that everyone has -- things like housing, insurance, groceries,   and healthcare. Other retirement expenses are specific to the   individual, like travel or big-ticket purchases. And then there   are some retirement expenses that seem to depend upon where you   live. A recent study by      American Advisors Group (AAG),    \u00a0a top reverse-mortgage lender, looked at retirement trends   by region. It highlighted some interesting expenses that people   living in each region were more likely to incur than those in   other areas of the country. Here are the top unique retirement   expenses by region.   Thinking of retiring in the South? A boat might be in your     future. Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();  Northeast: Living in a retirement community Retirement communities aren't just for elderly adults who can   no longer care for themselves. Independent retirement communities   give retirees the opportunity to live on their own without having   to bother with maintenance, property taxes, or any of the other   expenses that come with being a homeowner, and it may also give   them a chance to meet new friends. Residents of Northeast states -- including Connecticut,   Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New   York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont -- were more likely   to choose this lifestyle compared with residents in other   regions. The cost of living in a retirement community depends on where   it's located, which community you choose, and what amenities it   offers. Monthly costs can range from $1,500 on the low end to as   much as $10,000 on the high end. If you'd like to spend your   later years in a retirement community, try to estimate how much   you can reasonably afford each month. Or choose a community you   like and ask about its costs so you know how much you need to   save in order to enjoy your retirement there. South: Buying a boat Residents of states in the study's Southern region --   including Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky,   Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South   Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia -- were   more likely to purchase a boat in retirement, according to AAG.   This isn't all that surprising when you consider that all but   five of these states rest on the ocean or the Gulf of Mexico. The study didn't specify the type of boat Southern retirees   were more likely to buy. If you're someone who wants a boat in   your future, estimate the costs of the boat you'd like before you   retire. You'll also have to factor in the cost of storage, fuel,   a trailer, and winterizing the boat, if necessary. Your state   will likely require your boat be insured and registered as well.   Build these costs into your retirement plan now; you don't want   your pastime draining crucial funds set aside to cover your basic   living expenses. Midwest: Owning a pet Midwesterners were the most likely to own a pet in retirement,   according to the AAG study. This includes residents of Illinois,   Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska,   North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. The study didn't   drill down into which types of pets, but dogs and cats are   generally the most common. A few studies have looked at the average cost of ownership   over a pet's lifetime and found that for dogs, it's usually about   $15,000 to $18,000. Cats are slightly less expensive but can   easily cost between $8,000 and $15,000, depending on whether you   pay for things like pet insurance. These estimates don't include   the cost of unforeseen vet bills, and if you have multiple pets   in the home, you can expect these costs will be higher. If you'd   like a companion in retirement, factor these expenses into   your plan    and consider buying a pet insurance policy so an injury or   illness doesn't cost you a hefty chunk of your savings. West: Continuing education Residents of Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana,   Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming appear   to have the greatest ambitions for their retirement, according to   the AAG survey. Not only were they the most likely to want to   continue their education in retirement, they were also the most   likely to plan to   work a part-time job    . That could be a welcome source of income for those spending   money on furthering their education. Spending a lot isn't always necessary, though, unless you hope   to get a degree. There are a number of free resources online,   including courses from top universities -- good places to begin   if you're just trying to satisfy a curiosity. You might also be   able to audit courses at a university near you if you prefer   attending classes in person. If you do intend to get a degree or pay for classes in   retirement, price this out now and factor in inflation, which   continues to drive up the cost of tuition. You may not have any of these expenses in retirement, but if   you think you will, it's a good idea to start planning now. If   you don't budget for them, it could jeopardize your financial   security in your final years.   The $16,728 Social Security bonus most retirees     completely overlook       If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more)     behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of     little-known \"Social Security secrets\" could help ensure a     boost in your retirement income. For example: one easy trick     could pay you as much as\u00a0$16,728 more... each year!
