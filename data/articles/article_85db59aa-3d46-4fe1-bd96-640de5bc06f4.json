    "  At Home Group Inc  . HOME  gained 3.1% after its second-quarter fiscal 2020 earnings release, wherein earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues missed the same.  makeArticleAd();  The company's adjusted earnings of 18 cents per share in the quarter surpassed the consensus estimate of 15 cents by 20% but declined significantly from 34 cents registered a year ago. Notably, At Home has been facing higher labor costs in support of growth strategies, increased occupancy costs, higher preopening expenses on account of new store openings and rise in advertising expenses.   Revenue Discussion    At Home reported net sales of $342.3 million, which missed the consensus mark of $343 million by 0.3%. That said, the reported figure was up 18.7% from $288.5 million in the prior-year quarter owing to increased new store openings. However, a 0.4% decrease in comparable-store sales or comps partly offset the positives. The decline was due to adverse weather conditions.   At Home Group Inc.

Adjusted selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses,   as a percentage of net sales, declined 50 bps year over year to   22% mainly due to leverage of corporate overhead.        Adjusted operating margin contracted 300 bps to 6.8% from the   year-ago level owing to the above-mentioned headwinds. Adjusted   EBITDA of $47.1 million decreased 4.4% year over year during the   quarter under review.
