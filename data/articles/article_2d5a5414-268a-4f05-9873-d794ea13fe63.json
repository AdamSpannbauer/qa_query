  "text": [
    " Markets were extremely volatile in August as investors were wary about the escalating tariff dispute between Washington and Beijing. As we step into September, trade tensions and fears of recession continue to bother the Wall Street. In such a situation, investors are dumping stocks to park money in traditional safe-haven securities, leading to a year-to-date surge in gold price of roughly 19%.  Escalating US-Sino Tariff Battle  Since Sep 1, the Trump administration has imposed a 15% tariff on roughly $112 billion of imports from Beijing. America is set to impose a 15% tariff on a separate batch of Chinese goods of roughly $160 billion in value from Dec 15 onward. Beijing retaliated and started imposing additional tariffs on several imports from the United States to initiate its plan to impose extra duty on $75 billion of American goods. Of the total of 5,078 U.S. products that Beijing imports, 1,717 items have seen additional tariffs of 5% and 10%, respectively. The rest of the countermeasures will be put into effect on Dec 15.  Trade Dispute Threatens US Economy  The latest round of tariff by the Trump administration on billions of dollar worth of Chinese imports has raised prices of consumer goods. Americans now need to pay higher prices for more than 66% of products that Washington imports from Beijing. With higher retail prices for many products, the administration's latest stance is likely to impede America's economic growth since it is primarily driven by consumer spending. AllianceBernstein, global asset management firm, believes that if the tariff dispute intensifies, businesses in America will curtail their hiring programs. This is likely to further hurt domestic consumer spending, thereby posing additional risks to the U.S. economy.  Time to Pick Safe-Haven Stocks  September is going to be challenging since there are reasons for the stock market to remain volatile.
