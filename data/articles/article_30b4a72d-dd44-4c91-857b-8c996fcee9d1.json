    " Cancer has become a major health scare in the 21st century, with nearly every individual knowing someone or the other who has been affected. This life-threatening disease has attracted many big companies to invest in and develop solutions. Majority of the drug makers in the world are spending millions on developing treatment for oncology patients, with focus on the prevention, diagnosis and treatment. With still a diverse area left to explore and companies trying desperately to \"lead the market\" with its unique cancer-drug composition, investors can select stocks to gain attractive returns.  Cancer > 100 and Still Counting  Cancer in layman's term is a disease that is caused by the uncontrolled division of cells in the body. Doctors and researchers across the world have so far found more than 100 diseases, which can be collectively called cancer. The vast cancer-fighting industry has been broken down into several categories pre, in and post-cancer treatment. Companies that focus on prevention of cancer produce cessation products, for example smoking cessation products to reduce the risk of developing lung cancer. Others focus on diagnostics that involve analyzing and identification through tissue biopsies to determine the presence of cancerous cells.\u00a0 The treatment of cancer remains the primary focus, whether it is invasive and non-invasive surgeries or chemotherapies. Some cancer patients need personalized medicines caused by mutation in DNA from the cancer cells. Developing a generic medicine for cancer has a lot of grey area to cover and decades of research work still waits.  Why Invest in Cancer-Fighting Stocks?  In 2018, IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science reported around $150 billion was spent on medicines to treat cancer and this would rise to $250 billion in 2023. The investment in cancer-fighting stocks attracts investors with the potential to generate higher returns over the long term and beat the market. So far this year, the biotech sector has seen a boom boosted by new drug discovery, approval of patents and most importantly, mega-mergers. The S&P Biotechnology Select Industry Index is up by 12% on a year-to-date basis and is still growing. The biotech space took a flight in January 2019 with the announcement of the merger of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company BMY  and Celgene Corporation CELG  , two leading oncological drug makers. Bristol-Myers Squibb has offered to acquire Celgene for $74 billion.  5 Stocks to Buy Now  With the growing rate of cancer patients every year, cancer-fighting stocks seem to be gaining immensely.
