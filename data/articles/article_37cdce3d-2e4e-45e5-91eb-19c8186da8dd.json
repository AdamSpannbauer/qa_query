    "LONDON, Sept 5 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government abandoned attempts to block a law aimed at stopping at the country leaving the European Union without a deal in the upper house of parliament.",
    "The move paves the way for Johnson to ask the EU for a three-month extension to the Brexit deadline, if he fails to reach a deal with the bloc by the middle of October.",
    "Conservative Party members of the upper house of parliament had tabled a series of amendments in an attempt to run down the clock and prevent the law being passed before parliament is suspended on Monday."
