    " The REIT sector has emerged as one of the brilliant performers this year, with total returns  of the FTSE Nareit All REITs Index rallying 24.43% since the beginning of the year through Sep 10, outpacing the S&P 500 which gained 20.54% during the same period.  makeArticleAd();  REITs, which own and operate income-producing real estate, have comparatively lower exposure to trade tensions. These companies also benefit from resilient consumer sentiment, low unemployment level and rising wages.    Moreover, amid more Fed rate-cut anticipations, REITs are likely to gain as income-focused investors find these companies attractive, owing to their high dividend-paying nature. However, stable cash flows are more definite when fundamentals of the underlying real estate asset category of REITs display strength.   Why Residential REITs are Prudent Choice Now?    This is where residential REITs excel, as the latest figures  from real estate technology and analytics firm RealPage, Inc. RP  suggest that during the current year's prime leasing period, the U.S. apartment rental market successfully banked on the stellar demand for rental units.    The apartment rental market's fundamentals have been buoyed by a healthy job market, resilient consumer sentiment, household formation and high home-ownership costs in several markets, hindering transition from renter to homeowner.    In fact, with an impressive leasing activity in 2019's peak season, occupancy rate in August reached 96.3%. The figure is not only up 10 basis points (bps) sequentially and 40 bps year on year, but also marks the seventh straight month of the current occupancy uptrend and the highest rate since 2000.    Occupancy strengthened across all four regions of the United States, both on a monthly as well as annual basis, with the level reaching as high as 97.1% in the Northeast, 96.6% in the West, 96.5% in the Midwest and 95.7% in the South. This upswing in occupancy level amid steady delivery of new units looks encouraging.    With uptick in occupancy, rent growth also seems to be steady. In fact, August denoted the 12th successive month of annual rent growth holding steady at or above 3%, with monthly rents averaging $1,418. Per the report, rent growth has never remained above that level for such a longer period of time since 2016. This comes after a solid performance in July as well as in the April-June quarter.
