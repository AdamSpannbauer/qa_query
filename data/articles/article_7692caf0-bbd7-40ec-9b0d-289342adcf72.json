The tech's upward journey is far from over. The last few years have witnessed a series of breakthroughs in cloud computing, predictive analysis, AI, self-driving vehicles, digital personal assistants and IoT. Moreover, accelerated deployment of 5G technology - the next wireless revolution - is likely to create more opportunities.
