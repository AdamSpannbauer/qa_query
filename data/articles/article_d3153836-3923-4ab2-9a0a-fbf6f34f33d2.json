    "  Zions Bancorporation, National Association  's ZION  bottom-line growth is expected to be hurt by continuously increasing expenses. Moreover, the company's significant exposure to risky loan portfolios remains a concern.  makeArticleAd();  Its Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has been revised 5.2% lower over the past 60 days, reflecting that analysts are not optimistic regarding its earnings growth potential.    Thus, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).    Its price performance also does not seem impressive. Shares of the company have lost 19.2% in the past six months compared with 14.1% decline recorded by the industry  .        Looking at its fundamentals, Zions' expenses recorded a CAGR of 2.3% over the last four years (2015-2018) mainly because of higher salaries and employee benefit costs, net occupancy expenses, and advertising costs. In fact, as the company continues to invest in franchise, operating expenses are expected to increase in the quarters ahead, thereby hurting profitability to an extent.    Moreover, the company has significant exposure to risky loans. Commercial real estate (CRE) assets accounted for nearly 24.3% of the company's net loans and leases as of Jun 30, 2019.
