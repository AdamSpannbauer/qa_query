  "text": [
    " It was becoming increasingly clear that   $10 per month    wasn't going to cut it for Apple TV+, and   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) has apparently come to that same realization. The   Cupertino tech giant is entering a crowded market for   over-the-top (OTT) video streaming services, and investors are   already excited for   Disney    (NYSE: DIS) to launch Disney+. At $7 per month, that service's   value proposition looks   incredibly strong    , and a promotional offer that brought that price down to under   $4 per month   crashed Disney's site    last month. Apple has decided to undercut Disney+'s base pricing,   launching\u00a0Apple TV+ in November at just $5 per month.   Image source: Apple.makeArticleAd();  Giving TV+ away It takes many years and many billions of dollars to build up   an original content portfolio. Apple has already been at it for   about four\u00a0years, and its budget has reportedly   swelled\u00a0to $6 billion. Services chief Eddy Cue has already   stated that Apple is going for   quality over quantity    , and the initial slate of shows that will be available at launch   is fairly limited. Pricing the service at $10 per month would   have been a hard sell, especially when compared side by side to   Disney+, which is also set to launch in November. Disney+ will   include decades worth of content. Furthermore, Apple announced another surprise: Anyone who buys   a new iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, iPod Touch, or Mac gets a free year   of Apple TV+. That's a lot of TV+ subscriptions that the company   will be handing out -- Apple sells tens of millions of devices   per quarter -- although only one promotional offer can be claimed   and shared per household. It's unclear for how long the promotion   will run. The pricing and launch promotion are incredibly aggressive.   Apple   really    wants people to try out the new service and is effectively giving   itself another year to prove that its content is good enough for   subscribers to renew; the company will be continuously adding new   shows and movies each month. Marching toward 500 million Apple TV+ was always going to be a core part of Apple's   growing portfolio of services, and the service represents one of   its most significant cross-platform plays, since Apple TV+ will   also be available on competing   tech platforms    such as   Amazon    Fire TV and   Roku    , as well as through third-party smart TVs made by prominent   manufacturers like   Samsung    . The Mac maker set a target earlier this year of hitting 500   million paid subscriptions at some point in 2020. At the end of   the second quarter, it had already reached 420 million paid   subscriptions and has consistently added 30 million per quarter   over the past seven quarters. With Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade   launching, both at an affordable $5 per month, the company should   have no problem hitting that goal early next year.   10 stocks we like better than Apple       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.
