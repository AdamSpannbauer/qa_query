    "(New York)",
    "September is usually a very poor month for stocks. Investors     are generally uptight because of this, but this year tensions     are much higher after a brutal August that saw benchmarks fall     around 3%, a figure which frankly does not do justice to the     turmoil. The Dow actually averages a large decline in September     historically, and the month has only had positives returns 36%     of the time in the last 100 years. This statement from Barron's     says it all: \"If you only owned the S&P 500 in September     during every year, a $100 investment starting in 1969 would now     be worth just $70.",
    " FINSUM      :     September is usually bad (which does not really mean     anything for this year in itself), but this year could be extra     ugly because it may just be more of the same turmoil that has     already been occurring. ",
