  "text": [
    " Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all. By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss. However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores  system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks. Our proprietary system currently recommends Booking Holdings (BKNG) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank. Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this online booking service a great growth pick right now.  Earnings Growth  Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digi t earnings  growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration. While the historical EPS growth rate for Booking Holdings is 16.8%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 10.2% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 8.8%.  Cash Flow Growth  While cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds. Right now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Booking Holdings is 14.9%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 9.7%.

The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 17.1% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 15.6%.  Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions  Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions.
