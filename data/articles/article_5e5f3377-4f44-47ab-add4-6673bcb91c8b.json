    "(+) PVH Corp ( PVH  ) rose more than 8% after a regulatory filing showed board chairman and CEO Emanuel Chirico bought 133,155 shares of the apparel company's stock on Tuesday at an average price of $74.99 each.

    "In other sector news:",
    "(+) The Michaels Companies ( MIK  ) was more than 7% higher on Wednesday after the retailer reported a $0.19 per share adjusted Q2 profit, topping its non-GAAP net income of $0.15 per share during the same quarter last year and also beating the Capital IQ consensus for the three months ended August 3 by $0.05 per share. Net sales slipped from year-ago levels to $1.03 billion versus $1.05 billion, but also squeaked past the analyst mean looking for $1.02 billion in sales.",
    "(-) American Eagle Outfitters ( AEO  ) plunged almost 15% after the clothier Wednesday projected non-GAAP earnings for its current Q3 ending in October in a range of $0.47 to $0.49 per share, trailing the Capital IQ consensus by at least $0.03 per share. The company also said it was \"disappointed\" with its Q2 profit and revenue because those operating results lagged its internal expectations despite beating Wall Street estimates for the three months ended August 3.",
