    " Food processing is a complex industry, encompassing everything, from sorting raw materials, following the right production process, maintaining machinery to ensuring that the final product is on par with standards. But now, food processing can be easily monitored by AI-powered applications that not only do what humans do but also remarkably increase efficiency. Let us, thus, consider a few stocks that are riding the AI wave to make significant changes in the food processing industry.  AI's Promising Prospect in Food & Beverage   Market  According to a report  by Analytical Research Cognizance, AI in the Food and Beverage market is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 65.3% during 2019-2024. A major reason driving AI implementation is rapidly changing consumer preference. Consumer demand is increasingly shifting toward affordable and easily available food options. Therefore, faster and efficient food processing has become imperative, which can only be offered by AI applications. First, AI is used to sort different products and ingredients faster. Second, AI monitors and detects any contamination in food on a real-time basis (mostly via AI-enabled cameras). Third, equipment cleaning accounts for about a third of energy and water supplies of a food processing plant. AI-based sensor technology can save both and ensure proper usage.  Assisting Decision-Making  In fact, AI applications aren't just limited to assisting in food processing but realizing the kind of products customers seeks. This not only helps in determining what products a company should come up with but also finding crucial details on consumer preferences across various age groups and regions etc. This data can help companies manufacture the products in demand and channel them in the right places for increased sales. The Coca-Cola Company KO  and Kellogg Company K  are already putting this to use.  4 Stocks in Focus  We have chosen four stocks that either implement AI to food processing or offer AI programs that streamline productivity in the food processing industry. All of these stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).  Alphabet Inc. GOOGL  is developing AI algorithms that can assist in various functions in a food processing unit.
