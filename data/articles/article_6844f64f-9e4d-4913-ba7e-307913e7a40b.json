    " What happened  Appian    (NASDAQ: APPN) \u00a0stock soared 51.4% in August, according to   data from   S&P Global Market Intelligence    . Shares of the low-code software development platform provider   have gained 114% in 2019 through Sept. 3, making it one of this   year's best-performing   software-as-a-service    (SaaS) stocks. The   S&P 500    , including\u00a0dividends, fell 1.6% last month and has returned   17.5% so far this year.   Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();  So what We can attribute Appian stock's robust August performance   largely to the company's Aug. 8 release of   second-quarter results    that pleased investors.\u00a0Shares popped 19% the next day and   tacked on about 38% in the six-day period following the   release. The recen   t earnings    release likely brought Appian to the attention of new investors,   as the Virginia-based company only went public two years ago. In the second quarter, Appian's total revenue grew 12% year   over year to $66.9 million, led by subscription revenue's 41%   jump to $38 million. Professional revenue, which comprises the   bulk of the remaining revenue, only grew 3%, but this   lower-margin revenue is \"lumpy\" from quarter to quarter.   GAAP    (generally accepted accounting principles) net loss was $9.4   million, or $0.15 per share, compared with a net loss of $11   million, or $0.18 per share, in the year-ago period.        Adjusted for one-time items, the net loss contracted to $6.6   million, or $0.10 per share, from\u00a0$8.8 million, or $0.14 per   share, in the second quarter of last year. Wall Street was expecting Appian to post an adjusted loss of   $0.17 per share on revenue of $63.5 million, so the company   comfortably beat the consensus estimates for both the top and   bottom lines.

Furthermore, it expects subscription revenue to come   in between $38.8 million and $39 million, or grow about 32% to   33%.\u00a0The company forecasts an adjusted\u00a0net loss per   share of $0.16 to $0.15. Management also raised its full-year 2019 revenue projection   and slightly lowered its bottom-line outlook. It now expects:  Revenue of $260.5 million to $262.5 million, or growth of     15% to 16% year over year. Its previous guidance was for     revenue between $255 million and $258 million. An adjusted loss per share between $0.55 and $0.51, which     compares with an adjusted loss per share of $0.54 in 2018.
