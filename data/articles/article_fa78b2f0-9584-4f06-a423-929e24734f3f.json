Palo Alto Networks Inc    (NYSE: PANW)        Q4\u00a02019 Earnings Call       Sep 4, 2019 ,   4:30 p.m. ET makeArticleAd(); Contents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  Operator  Please welcome, Vice President of Investor Relations, David   Niederman.  David Niederman    --   Vice President of Investor Relations  Hello. Thanks for coming, we really appreciate it. Good   afternoon, I am David Niederman Vice President of Investor   Relations at Palo Alto Networks. Thanks for joining us today to   discuss our Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2019 Results.   This meeting is being broadcast live over the web and can be   accessed on our Investor Relations section of our website at   investors.paloaltonetworks.com. Earlier this afternoon, we issued a press release announcing   our results for our fiscal fourth quarter and full year ended   July 31, 2019. We also provided a script of certain fiscal fourth   quarter and full-year 2019 financial results and operating   metrics along with applicable reconciliations as exhibits to a   curren   t report    on Form 8-K filed with the SEC earlier this afternoon. Copies of   these materials can also be found on the Investors section of our   website. I'd like to remind you that management will be making   forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our   near and long-term financial guidance and strategy as well as   modeling points for Q1'20 and full year fiscal 2020. Please   kindly take a moment to review the Safe Harbor language provided   with the meeting materials, also please note that certain   financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a   non-GAAP basis, and have been adjusted to exclude certain   charges. For historical periods, we provided reconciliations of these   non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in the   supplemental financial information that can be found at the end   of the presentation and the investor section of our website   located at investors.paloaltonetworks.com. On stage with us today   will be Nikesh Arora, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer;   Kathy Bonanno, our Chief Financial Officer; Lee Klarich, our   Chief Product Officer; and Nir Zuk, our Chief Technology Officer.   We will have a Q&A forum at the end of the financial   presentation. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kathy.  Kathy Bonanno    --   Chief Financial Officer  Hi everyone, thank you so much for coming today, I look a   smattering of applause how nice, I appreciate that. Thank you.   Thank you all very, very much for coming today, we appreciate   your interest in Palo Alto Networks. We have a lot to cover   today, and so I'm just going to get right into it. I'm going to   start by providing a quick overview of our fiscal Q4 results for   the fiscal year 2019 and full year results. Nikesh will then come   up and he'll walk you through our strategy and our operating   framework for the next three years, and then Lee Klarich and Nir   Zuk will take you through our product strategy and I'll return to   cover forward-looking guidance at the end. So let's turn now to fiscal fourth quarter 2019 which   capped-off another great year for Palo Alto Networks. In the   quarter, we grew revenue 22% year-over-year to approximately $806   million. Quarterly billings crossed the billion-dollar mark, a   first in the Company's history. And our performance in Prisma and   Cortex or as we refer to them collectively as next-gen security   was especially strong. Our next-gen security billings were   approximately $192 million in the quarter, this represents a $768   million annual run-rate to approximately -- and accelerated our   growth to approximately 180% year-over-year. For the full fiscal   year, we also delivered strong top line results and full-year   free cash flow was approximately $924 million. If we adjust for   the cash charges associated with our headquarters in Santa Clara   and the retirement of our 2019 convertible debt free cash flow   for the year was $1.1 billion at a margin of 36.7%. So let's turn now to some of the product highlights for the   quarter. In Q4, we completed the acquisitions of Twistlock and   PureSec, and we are actively integrating them into our Prisma   cloud offering. We also released significant updates to Prisma   access including providing over 100 network on-boarding locations   around the globe and providing clean pipe for service providers,   along with several other unique capabilities in that release. In   addition, we released Traps 6.1, which included expanded support   for Mac OS and Linux, further strengthening our endpoint and XDR   offerings. And we received FedRAMP certification for WildFire cloud, a   huge milestone toward shifting government wildfire usage toward   the cloud. And as you probably just saw earlier this afternoon,   we announced our intent to acquire Zingbox, an enterprise IoT   security company. As Nikesh will discuss a bit later, this   acquisition if you had another example of our ongoing strategy to   consolidate new technologies into our next generation firewall   platform, making it easier for customers to protect their complex   enterprise environment. In addition to product releases, we had   several notable wins during the quarter. We displaced Symantec   and Zscaler at a Fortune 50 U.S. retailer to secure their data   center and network of more than 2000 retail outlets. We displaced Zscaler and the Fortinet at a major European   national healthcare provider in their digital transformation   project. They're securing their hundreds of hospitals, along with   all of their patients and employees. It was a great win for us in   the quarter. VP, CrowdStrike and displaced Symantec with our   Prisma and Cortex platforms at a global insurance company with   more than 25 million policyholders and we bid Fortinet and   display Cisco to become the standard security platform for the   government of one of the most populist regions in Asia   Pacific. In summary, there was a lot of great news in the quarter. We   continue to have high win rates against our competition and add   thousands of new customers every quarter. In Q4, we added nearly   3,000 new customers and are now privileged to have won nearly   65,000 customers. We're looking forward to another great year in   fiscal 2020, and we'll now move on to the rest of the   presentation. Please welcome, our CEO, Nikesh Arora.  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Good afternoon. Thank you very much for joining us, and thank   you, Kathy. Normally when I get up on stage, I usually ask the   audience, what can I answer that you leave your happy. Now many   of you are so kind, you've written me very long notes about what   do you want me to tell you, which we're going to make you happy.   It's very helpful. Just like I have my marching orders you've   given me the script. So Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley, yes, we   will talk about product evolution M&A. Keith Bachman talks   about depth and duration of depressed cash flow stands very   depressing, but we'll talk about that they're not depressed. We will go down to the details of our next generation security   business and explain the financial models around you, they don't   get spooked by duration issues. And yes, Brad, no hardware   company of this size have made a transition like this, but   hopefully we just need to keep growing and not make the   transition. You do notice that we're displacing your favorite company   Zscaler and many situations. So, but I'm scared today, we had   changes or recommendations, something is going to happen to the   rest of you guys. So for now, and I'm happy with Brad where he   is? So it's about 12 plus months, I've been at Palo Alto Networks   and I know you guys have been asking for us to come about and   explain how we're thinking about this Company going forward. So,   hopefully in the next 75-80 minutes me, Nir, Lee and many of my   management colleagues will share our plan for the next three   years with you, in terms of where we want to take this   Company. Before I go there, I thought I would do is quickly walk you   through what I've learned over the last 12 months. Now   unfortunately there is going to be no earth-shattering secrets.   And what I'm going to tell you in the first section -- but   hopefully, you'll get a sense that I mean studying this industry   for a while and the problems are obvious, right this is $140   billion industry, and we have too many vendors. I've gone to over   300 customers in the last one year. The winner so far is 212   cyber security vendors deployed under one customer. That's a lot.   What that happens is when you have 212 cybersecurity vendors and   cybersecurity is only 8% to 10% of your spend, it's way too many   vendors for the amount of spend you do on IT compared to the rest   of the vendors we have. What that results in, is people are deploying too many tools,   one of these customers, not the 212 vendor customer has nine   endpoints deployed. We have nine CRM systems, we've nine HR   systems, we have nine endpoints in one financial services   organization. We think that model is broken, it's wrong, it   cannot be the part of securing that enterprise for the future. If   you think what we do in the industry is we give you the tools,   and say now, you can write policy against it, you can spin-up a   bunch of alerts and we'll give you all the dealers and you can   figure out what to do with them. So we have tremendous amounts of alerts being generated in   many of our customers and Lee and Nir will talk more about this.   On average a customer can get 175,000 alerts a week, it's a lot   of alerts. And then you spent a lot of time and effort manually   going through your issues in investigating which can take   anywhere from 4 to 57 days. We have an industry where we have too   many vendors, too many tools, too many alerts, and too much   manual labor. We think at the same time all are busy complicating   the industry. Our friends -- the adversaries have gotten more and   more sophisticated. The days of malicious software, the days of   key loggers are gone. Now we're talking about AI based bots, ML   based attacks and people are really addressing your entire   enterprise infrastructure, trying to figure out how to get   it. The amount of breaches have actually gone up. Last year is   about 3,800 breaches and mostly the breaches were automated   attacks. So it's got an interesting situation in the industry. We   have a situation where people are spending more and more money on   cybersecurity and they're feeling less secure. This is a problem.   This problem needs to be fixed. So we believe we need a new   paradigm for security and much of what we're going to talk about   is what that new paradigm is going to be or needs to be. We   believe we need to go toward lesser number of vendors. We believe   you need to go toward more comprehensive security. We believe   this has to be more of an automated industry as opposed to an   industry that is full of -- lot of manual labor. So a lot of what   Lee and Nir are going to talk about is going to be how our   products are going to enable that going forward and we will talk   specifically about some of the things we're working on which will   be unveiled over the course of next few quarters and years, and   how we intend to make this happen. At the same time we are at an inflection point in the   industry, in my travels over the last 12 months, and my time at   Google, I have met a customer who is not thinking about going to   the cloud. Almost every customer I met, approximately 10   [Phonetic] of them is in some way, shape or form on their journey   to the cloud, some of them are evaluating the cloud, some of them   are sort of deploy some application in the cloud, some of them   are in a hybrid cloud environments -- going to go to multiple   clouds, but there is not a customer who is not talking about the   cloud. Interestingly, we don't believe that cloud security has   matured as fast as the cloud platforms have. So the best   security, you can get us some cloud data security offered by an   individual platform provider, but we actually don't have   comprehensive cloud security that allows you to make that journey   to the cloud in a more comfortable and happy fashion. So our   belief is, as we see this cloud market go to potentially $1   trillion over the next five years, there is a huge opportunity   for cloud security to play a relevant role in allowing these   customers to make their cloud journey over the next three to five   years. It's a big opportunity and the big opportunity we have   here is to make sure we don't make the same mistakes we've made   in enterprise security. We need to get cloud security, right. We anticipate in cloud security, there is an opportunity for   us to become a platform of choice and customers not have to deal   with the problem of too many tools, too many vendors, too many   alerts and too much manual labor. I won't talk more about that   when Lee and Nir come and talk about what we've been doing in the   last 12 months for cloud security. So before I walk, before I   have them come up on stage and talk about the opportunity ahead   of us, I want to make sure I give you a sense of what we're doing   for the last 12 months and you guys have been writing all these   notes, I'm trying to figure out what we love to, as a company.   Let's take a look at where we've come from. 12 months ago when I   came to Palo Alto Networks, we had a phenomenal Company, the   Company that has built an amazing firewall had a great brand,   tremendous amounts of trust with our customers in all 50,000   customers in the market. There is a lag between when click this when this slide shows   up. This is Palo Alto Networks. We were -- are primarily a   firewall company. We've made a few acquisitions and we had done a   bunch of projects in the side. But despite the way we had   implemented and we have managed to get 8% [Phonetic] of our   billings from not at our services outside of our firewall   business. The worrying thing was though, I noticed we would   acquire companies and decouple them and merge them into our   hardware-based business. So that's a bad thing if you start   taking the software businesses and start making the workload   hardware businesses. Hardware has a certain [Indecipherable],   cycle has certain deployment cycle, software as a slightly   different cycle. It's very important for us to make sure we were   going to get this right. We spent the last 12 months, focusing. Now I may not know   enough about cybersecurity, but having spent as many of you know   I spent 10 years at Google, the one thing I did learn at Google   is the first and foremost, you have to get your product strategy   right. So poor Lee Klarich, our Head of Product; Nir, our CTO,   and many of our product colleagues has spent many a nice sitting   with me, writing and rewriting product plans, looking at   competition, looking at our strategy, looking at whether we are   set up to win or not. And literally rearchitecting many of our   products and our strategy is to make -- we set ourselves up to   win. Please spend -- ours there are written documents and   probably on their 15th the durations, we went through every   product categories in that, why do you make this acquisition?   What is the way to win in this category? How are you going to --   when do we have enough resource to deploy it against that? And   once we get the product right, do we have the go-to-market   capability, to go make this happen in the market. It wasn't simple. It wasn't easy, but some of it is also very   exciting. In our firewall business, we had been selling   subscriptions, four subscriptions against our firewalls. I mean,   sat and talk about why cannot the firewall become a platform? Why   cannot we take or we have the firewall and instead of having 20   different network appliances in a customer's infrastructure like   on our firewall become the platform of the future for enterprise   security. So as Lee and Nir will talk about, we are going to go from   four to potentially 10, maybe more subscriptions over time,   because we believe once our customers trust us to be part of   their enterprise infrastructure, we have the ability to go and   deploy more and more capability into that infrastructure. And we   will talk about our latest acquisition of Zingbox, the whole   intent is to make that another subscription on firewall. We   believe our customers will deploy that firewall, just the way,   they've deployed DNS security, which we launched a few months   ago. So on our firewall side, we have built, we have continued to   build the next generation firewall into a faster, better   firewall. But really when we went back to the drawing board we   sat back and said, Nir if you were starting a company and   building firewalls so that we wanted to. Although some of you   believe the firewalls are not going to be interesting. We'll talk   about why they're going to continue to be interesting. We sat   down and thought, how would you rearchitect the firewall business   and how do you build it going forward. So what you will see as   part of our enterprise strategy firewalls is our expectations of   how this market is going to evolve and how do we need to be in   the top right of that Magic Quadrant continue to go further in   that direction as opposed to not continue the innovation. Not only that, on our cloud front, we had one acquisition   called Evident, we've made 12 months ago. Over the last 12   months, we've examined the cloud security space very, very   carefully. We believe there needs to be a comprehensive   multi-cloud, multi-technology platform available for cloud   security. We have made two acquisitions in that space with   Twistlock and PureSec and we hope to be able to integrate them   very swiftly, hopefully before the end of this calendar year and   be able to provide the best cloud security platform to our   customers. Prisma cloud, I'm not confusing this would VMs or any other   product, has over 1,000 customers already. We do not believe   there is any cloud security company in the world today with over   1,000 customers securing the public cloud, none. And we've been   able to achieve that over the last 12 months. Not only that, we   looked at our products called GPCS, which is effectively Prisma   access, which is, I shouldn't talk about competition just yet. So   it's a product with real security that helps you secure cloud   native architectures, unlike some of the things in the market. I   think is a popular -- today's Lexicon. So we took Prisma access,   we resource that we moved to Google Cloud we on-boarded 200 plus   locations and you saw the results. We had the biggest quarter   over Prisma access in Q4 than we ever had in the Company. We have   our first over $10 million deal for Prisma access where as we   highlighted we've displaced Zscaler. So feel very confident in   our ability to keep building Prisma access as one of the future   architecture for securing the cloud. On securing the future, we looked hard at the SOC industry.   And Lee and Nir will talk about it. We weren't comfortable with   the way the industry is going. We're not comfortable where the   solution needs to be that you take all the data, put it in a very   large data repository, run a bunch of analytics against and   spin-up more alerts. These alerts get them to the SOCs analyst   thing that you had 174,000, I've got another 100 really good   alerts for you take a look at. That's not the right answer. We looked at the market, we acquired Demisto, Demisto has done   really well for us, and we believe the future of SOCs is going to   be more toward automation and Lee and Nir will talk about more   about what we're able to do in that space. We also took what was   our [Indecipherable] acquisition and our like severance IVR   acquisitions and looked heart of the EDR space and said, where is   the endpoint industry going to evolve to, how are we're going to   win. We launched XDR four months ago, we've had our first full   quarter of XDR and we're delighted with the fact that 250   customers have already been acquired by the XDR team. Now this   wasn't done without our ability to run, not just the product   focus, but also a focus in our go-to-market capability. Over the   last 12 months, we have taken our Prisma and Cortex teams from   500 people 1,500 people. We did that by hiring new people and   acquisitions and effectively redeploying resources from what   would have been part of our core business into our new business,   which is what has allowed us to accelerate our Prisma and Cortex   growth rate from approximately 70% odd to 180% as Kathy   highlighted. But we feel very confident that is a number or set   of numbers we can really focus on and drive further and we'll   talk more about where we expect those numbers to go over the next   three years. So what does it, was it look like today? We've been able to   grow our billings from our next generation security services to   $452 million, approximately 13% of our total billings in FY'19.   And we feel very, very confident that we have our product   portfolio cleared up and we believe we are actually in the   process of delivering and deploying three different platforms in   the market, one around our firewall, one around our cloud   security and one around securing the future where both the   firewalls and our cloud security capabilities come together in   the slot. We believe our opportunity in the enterprise is to be   able to simplify enterprise security and reduce the number of   vendors, and that alliance our customers have with vendors. And   it's fascinating as Kathy highlighted one of our very large   retail customers we acquired in Q4 has gone to a single vendor   solution. A single vendor across all forms of firewalls, firewalls and   the data center, virtual firewall against our cloud instances and   Prisma access against their network security needs. So we are   noticing customers rearchitecting the security as I think about   going to the cloud, that rethinking to the need multiple vendors   to secure them across these various form factors across these   various technologies and many of the smarter ones of course I'm   going to say that are making the choice toward consolidating into   a single vendor platform. Not only that, on the cloud front we've   had customers off we acquired Twistlock and RedLock, who are in   evaluation mode have signed multi-million dollar multi-year deals   with us, because now they believe where Twistlock and RedLock and   PureSec with Palo Alto Networks, we are going to keep building   and investing in these products and continue to grow them further   and they're delighted with our vision in terms of how we plan to   deliver cloud security to them. We believe we have an opportunity to keep being ahead of the   curve of cloud security and it was funny. When we acquired   RedLock, the RedLock team kind of means that we're going to go,   build continues security for you. That just sounds wonderful. I   came to New York and I went to about 10 to 15 customers in the   financial services and said, look you're using our Prisma cloud   security, we're going to build the container security in nine   months. So like, we don't have time. We're going to take what's   out there, the best of you continue to secure, we're going to use   it. It's interesting, our customers want best of breed, but they   don't want to wait for integrated platform to appear and be   available across multiple technologies. So we have been able to   take RedLock and Twistlock and PureSec and put them together and   offer best-of-breed across container serverless and public cloud   to our customers as a platform. We believe our opportunity is to stay ahead in that space and   deliver comprehensive multi-cloud, multi-platform integrated   security solution for a cloud. Last but not the least, in the   future, we believe we have the opportunity of taking good data as   opposed to all data. Taking that and applying analytics to it and   being able to provide tremendous amounts of automation to allow   our customers to be able to secure the future. So I had an option   of standing up here and regaling you with my product capability   and my product knowledge, but I figured one of the highlights of   today, it could be for you guys to hear from our Founder, who is   promised to give you an unfiltered version of what he thinks   about the industry and how things need to go from there. And then we'll have Lee [Indecipherable] and moderate him to   make sure he doesn't go off the rails. But before I invite them,   I'm delighted to say, last time, we had an Analyst Day, we   pointed you to a Palo Alto Networks stands at about $19 billion.   We believe with all the product investment and product capability   have developed, we now have the opportunity of addressing those,   close to 70 people in dollar term in FY '22. The magic of FY '22   is you will notice when I come back after Lee and Nir have talked   about our product investments, I'm going to give you guidance for   the next three years in terms of what we expect our billings to   be and what we expect our next generation security capabilities   to get to our cash flows and our operating margins. So hold your   breath, don't hold your breath, just hang in there. With that, let me welcome Lee and Nir up on stage.  Lee Klarich    --   Chief Product Officer  Good afternoon.  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Good afternoon.  Lee Klarich    --   Chief Product Officer  I've been working with Nir for a very, very long time almost   10 years. And I think this is the first time that he and I are   actually sharing a stage together. So here we go, and that should   be fine. I guess there should be fine. So what we'd like to do a   share with you our product strategy and how we think about   things. And we will fit that into the contracts that Nikesh has   walked through in terms of the three pillars, securing the   enterprise, securing the cloud and securing the future. Now I've been in the security industry for a very long time.   I've been in Palo Alto Networks for very long time and I can't   definitively say that I've never been more excited and confident   in our ability to deliver these platforms in a very unique and   differentiated way. Now to kick us off, no better person than Nir to talk about   securing the enterprise. Nir?  Nir Zuk    --   Chief Technology Offcer  Thank you, Lee. So let's talk a little bit about securing the   enterprise, specifically about network security. I know that some   of you would like to believe that the firewall is going away, and   there is no role for network security in the future. In reality,   there are things that have to be done through the network --   through network security and there is just not a place to do   them. And so things like looking for command and control   connections. Things like combining access control, user identity   and authorization systems. And most importantly, more than half   of the devices that enterprise use today cannot be protected by   running something on the device itself, have to be protected from   the network. Mobile phones, we've locked down operating systems   or limited battery life, routers, switches, printers,   network-attached scanners and all other kind of IoTs like IP   phones and things like that. The only way to protect them is   through the network because you can't run anything on it. So   network security is here to stay, it's always been the core of   cybersecurity and will continue to be the core of cybersecurity,   but changes have to be made, because over time applications have   been moving from the corporate data center into the cloud with   our SaaS or public cloud and users have been moving from   corporate networks into smaller offices, branch offices they have   been moving of the network completely in the form of being mobile   users and network security has to follow them and network   security has to follow them wherever they go because again there   are things that network security is the only thing or there   things that network security has to do, like so on cybersecurity   functionality, like access control and supporting again devices   that can only be done from the network. The challenge is how you do that, how do you follow the user   when they're off the network, how do you follow the application   when it's running in the public cloud, and more importantly, like   Nikesh said, customers are asking us to consolidate more and more   functionality that would deploy in the network separately from   the firewall into the single next generation based platform that   we have created. And to talk about that and the innovation around   it, we'll go back to Lee.  Lee Klarich    --   Chief Product Officer  So there is lots of innovation is going on in next-gen   firewall. There is two areas in particular, I want to talk   through with all of you today that are -- of particular   importance. The first is sort of piggyback off when Nir was   talking about the importance of form factors, OK. How do we take   all the same capabilities and make sure that they can be deployed   everywhere, the in-line security as needed. And this is something   we started driving several years ago when we expanded from   hardware appliance form factors to software form factors with the   VM series. Since that time, VM series has turned into the leading   virtual next-gen firewall in the market. And then from there and   we're recently we expanded into delivering these capabilities as   a service with Prisma access, which allows us to extend security   out to mobile users branch offices, retail environment, et   cetera. Now with particularly powerful about this, in addition to be   able to provide consistent security everywhere, is the ability to   have a single control plane to be able to manage this   consistently as well. As Nikesh mentioned earlier, one of our   very large customer acquisitions in the previous quarter was a   customer who had been with us for a while with hardware and the   data center. And in the quarter as they extended that using   VM-series and Prisma access into a complete solution, and what   was particularly exciting and relevant to them was the ability to   get that consistent security consistent control plane, we can't   get anywhere else. Now, going hand in hand with us, is the ability to use of   firewall as a platform for delivering more and more capabilities.   If you look -- if you think about the enterprise security market,   it is actually insane. The number of different security vendors   that customers have to deal with is crazy. We have a running   tally of the most number of security vendors that customers deal   with when they come to our -- or you'd to be see hear about what   we can do for them. I think the latest record is now up well   above 200 different security vendors for a single customer. They   have to deal with and manage. Now we have been, from the very beginning, starting   consolidate these through integrating best-in-class capabilities   into our next-gen firewall. We did this with IPS, we did this   with filtering and we really substantially change those markets.   We took a bit of a hiatus but we're back. The DNS security   launched earlier this year, our fifth subscription for the   next-gen firewall and we intend to extend this more rapidly going   forward to be able to integrate, what would otherwise be   stand-alone capabilities and be able to consolidate those into   our firewall platform. Importantly to do that across all form   factors as well. Now, you saw the announcement earlier today, our Zingbox for   IoT security, I'll talk about that a little bit more detail in a   second. But just to give you some flavor for the security   services, we're looking at. We're also actively working on and   building SD-WAN, as an example, that we will be able to integrate   across the different form factors, in order to be able to again   both simplify as well as provide better capabilities to our   customers across their network environments. Now, to talk about IoT the, this is becoming a very much a   growing issue within the enterprise, as you can see from some of   the things here, even fish tanks can be used to break into   enterprises and move laterally. Hackers are using IoT devices as   both initial insertion points as well as the ability to move   laterally across networks. Now, why is this? IoT devices are --   have become very ubiquitous across the enterprise. By our   estimation what we've observed in both our own environment as   well as others for every employee, there is about three different   IoT devices in the typical enterprise. In many cases IoT devices   they're unpatched, they're unmanaged, they're connected by   definition, there is a security risk. I believe that every single   one of our 65,000 customers hasn't growing IoT security needs.   And we will be unique in being able to deliver that as an   integrated service to our next-gen firewall, obviating the need   to deploy yet more hardware, in order to get a very relevant and   important new security service. Without us the options are looking at a handful of small   vendors and trying to figure out which one to invest in and which   one you're going to take the operational burden of trying to   deploy throughout your network. That's a very powerful approach   that we are able to take by delivering necessary integrated   service. And so with that combination of the evolving and   expanding form factors, the ability to then deploy multiple and   additional security services to those form factors, we see a   great opportunity to address the network security TAM, as well as   an opportunity to replace what today is often outsourced manual   labor with product and automation. You'll see that theme as we   talk about the different areas. This ability to look to leverage   automation to replace outsource manual labor is one of the large   opportunities we have in consolidating the products around   us. So switching gears from enterprise to the cloud. Okay, now,   when we talk about cloud, we're going to talk about two distinct   aspects of the cloud. The first, just about every enterprise is   on some journey of moving some of their applications to the   cloud. Typically, multi-cloud they're often still keeping the   data -- part of the data center for some of the applications. So   it's hybrid that is one opportunity, very significant   opportunities you saw before. The second is to leverage the cloud   to deliver security to the end users, those are mobile branch   office, et cetera. So let's start with securing the cloud. Now a concept that all of you have seen, probably a million   times. But just an important concept is a shared responsibility   model. Customers are responsible for the security of everything   they deploy in the cloud. And as we've seen many of these   applications that we deploy are mission critical, have incredibly   sensitive data and they need the best security solution across   multi-cloud and hybrid cloud. Now to put this in context, the   world has moved beyond lift and shift to large extent and we'll   continue to move toward more cloud native application   architectures, which will require a cloud first approach to   security. You cannot simply take on-prem data center capabilities   and simply move them, you have to take into approach. What you're seeing here is a typical application that is   multiple different components, which is very standard. Each of   those components often running in a different technology stack.   So how do you secure an application like that? All right, so it   requires a lot of the same security functions wherever the   application is, but those security functions have to then be   applied across all the different technology stacks. For example,   you need to vulnerability management of course and you need to   apply that to VM's. The typical industry answer to this would be   say, that's a product. The problem is you're going to get to   that. Every line representing a different product. Now if you're   an enterprise looking at that, -- that's a lot. We are at risk of   repeating the sense of the past, if we let that happen. I firmly believe the Palo Alto Networks is the only Company in   a position, and with the focus of preventing that from happening.   With Prisma cloud, our intention and what we are delivering to   our customers is the most comprehensive cloud security platform   that they can get. Taking these different capabilities, applying   them across the different technology stacks, multi-cloud and even   hybrid cloud to help secure our customers journey to the cloud.   And to be clear, there is a lot that is yet to be done. I   anticipate that there are a number of cloud security technologies   that haven't been invented yet, but we will have to be thinking   about. And we will continue to be very decisive and purposeful   about building out this platform and continue to maintain its   position as the most comprehensive solution. Now to talk about the other kind of cloud and for that   Nir.  Nir Zuk    --   Chief Technology Offcer  Thank you, Lee. Maybe before that I'm very excited about   Prisma Cloud. When we started the company and Lee has been with   me, since the beginning. When we started the company, we are   going to build an acceleration firewall and we had a bunch of   very large vendors that we have to go and displace which we've   done. But we're today by far the largest network security vendor   out there. It was a lot of work displacing them. I think that   with cloud with public cloud security and generally with cloud   security the market is open. There is the need, I don't see any   other vendor in a position to do this. And I think that the   numbers that you've seen and the numbers that you will see speak   for themselves. Because to do this, you have to first have the   firewall because there is no way to secure the cloud without a   firewall, you have to look at the things that only the firewall   can look and there are things that's running in the cloud, that   you need a firewall, because you can't run endpoint security on   them. And then on top of that, you need all the different   technologies that we've been building and acquiring and   integrating over the last few years, that I just don't see anyone   out there that's even thinking about it nevertheless, someone   that has the different components that are required in order to   go after the cloud security market. So very excited about that,   at least as much as much as we're excited when we started Palo   Alto Networks and went after the enterprise security market. Now   once applications start moving to the cloud, which they are,   enterprise network architectures and access architectures are   changing. And the reason for that -- oops we are missing a slide   here. Sorry. Okay, yeah, so the reason for that is that   traditionally the way users have been accessing enterprise   applications, which were running in enterprise data centers was   through remote access solutions like GlobalProtect for example   and through MPLS, IPVPN MPLS links, and those links were offering   guaranteed bandwidth and guaranteed performance that they were   great way to access enterprise applications. Once applications   start moving to the cloud whether it's SaaS or public cloud and   once users are moving into smaller offices into branch offices   and of course, become mobile, it doesn't make sense anymore to   run all the traffic through the data center and then go out to   the Internet. You want to have direct Internet access from   wherever the user is, whether it's in the branch office or   whether the user is mobile. Of course with the tradition of the cybersecurity industry,   the way we're doing it or the way the industry is doing it is by   offering more and more and more solutions to try to do it, try --   we have mTLS and then side to side VPNs. And then some traffic   goes -- SaaS traffic has to go a CASB proxy, then we have a bunch   of CASB companies. And of course our favorite topic, the cloud   delivered security VI proxy. And maybe a side note here, and if I   have seem a little bit angry then maybe because it is I am,   because I feel like I'm playing a whack-a-mole game, because   about 24 years ago, I had to kill the first generation of proxies   with [Indecipherable] inspection. If you remember, companies like   Secure Computing anyone here cover them? You'll probably   responsible for them having a higher market cap than checkpoint   at the time. I'm not sure where they are today and companies like Raptor   and others, and of course proxy is always had the issues with   proxies, they are slow, they break applications, they break   networking, they break network optimization, network routing and   so on. So hard to kill them the first time. And then 12 years ago   in 2007, when we started selling our products here, we had to   kill the next generation of proxies, the Blue Coat and the   Websense's of the world, which again didn't make any sense.   Proxies have never made sense, they are slow, high latency, they   break applications, you can't run everything to them, they break   networking. And so on, which we have, we all know our Blue Coat   is today right part of Broadcom and I'm not sure Websense is. And   now it's measureful right, third time and other mole is popping,   we have to deliver security from the cloud, how we're going to do   it? Guess what, we're going to do it with a proxy. Now, why would you do it with a proxy and not with network   security, because it is easy, it's very difficult to become a   network security company, it's very difficult to build something   that can go into the infrastructure, whether it's physical or   virtual and provide the networking and security the pocket based   security at the application level. So vendors are taking the easy   way out, right, let's put a proxy, so we break applications, so   we break the network who cares, customers are going to pay for it   anyways, and they are trying to use proxies to solve the   issue. So first I think proxy is the wrong way to -- and I'm not   think, I'm sure proxies are boring. If I were here six months   ago, I would say we're going to kill the proxy after what you've   seen and what I've seen in the last two quarters, we have killed   the proxy. But again -- but I really think that it's not just a   proxy, it's this -- it's this mess that the industry suggesting   in order to fix the access challenges that are associated with   the move to the cloud. And of course there is a much better   solution, and that by better solution is what Prisma access is   about. The Prisma access takes mobile users, and it takes branch   offices in a single cloud delivered firewall -- through firewall   base our firewall-based solution, it provides access to SaaS   applications with our CASB, to public cloud applications to   on-premise applications and whatever comes next this platform is   going to do. And the reason this platform has been so successful   in the last couple of quarters and is going to continue to be so   successful is because when customers see this versus the mess   that today is called access, again a mess driven by the cloud,   the choice is very, very clear. This is the way to do it. And if   I look at our position in the market there are not many firewall   vendors out there. There are probably four firewall vendors that   sell today, the other three vendors are busy trying to figure out   why they can't sell hardware against our hardware. I just don't   see anyone else today in a position to go and capture this huge   access to the cloud market. I really like our position, I really   like where we are today and I certainly like where we are taking   it into -- in the future. Sorry, I'll continue. So now that we've covered. [Video   Presentation] Can you imagine trying to access X-ray data through a proxy,   they tried, and they have to throw out the huge deployment of   that proxy. So going back to TAM, we think that cloud security in   2020 represents a very large TAM, a very large opportunity. And   like I said, I personally just don't see much competition over   there and anyone that has the components to compete against us,   in cloud security. And then if you look at the automation that's   needed in order to drive that security automation that today is   done by people, and we do that with software and analytics, the   opportunity becomes even larger, OK. So now that we cover the first two pillars, let's move to   secure the future. So let me cash that, both enterprise security   and cloud security are here to stay with us for a long time. And   we have to do both and we have to be good at both and we are   going to be continuing doing both and be the market leaders in   both. At some point, these two converge in the security operation   system, because the security operation system needs to run both   enterprise security and cloud security and it all comes to one   place. And they are big issues in the security operations today   that just aren't that basically make this security persons that   are not prepared for the future. And we've decided a couple of   years ago to go and fix that to prepare the security operation   center for the future. So let's just talk about what's not working in the security   operation center. Most security operation centers are based   around a technology called SIEM, Security Incident and Event   Management, by the way -- nothing to do with incident and event   management, but whatever we'll call them that, that basically   collect as much log as they can from network devices and   endpoints and applications and servers and wherever they can get   logs from and then to have a bunch of static rules and or manual   labor looking at this data and guess what they do, they generate   alerts based on the data. Now of course, the data that's coming   in, already includes alerts, because if the firewall or the IPS   or whatever found something bad or something bad was found, bad   was found in the public cloud, and so on. On top of the alerts, that's the SIEM collects and displays   with the user, the SIEM has rules, we call them correlation rules   that generate even more alerts. Some theme have some filtering   mechanism to filter out alerts, usually they filter out alerts   that needed, going -- target why they had been alert, I told them   about the breach and only looked at it nine months later. And   then all of that leads to reactive investigation. And what the   industry is trying to do to fix that, ask any customer, they will   tell you that the SIEM is broken. Right now, the solution to the   SIEM broken is we're going to switch to another broken SIEM, with   the hope that, that out of broken SIEM is going to be better, and   it's not. And the more advanced companies in the industry, I figured out   that something has to be done. And what has to be done is you   have to collect much more meaningful data from the network or   from endpoints and so on, and provide much more meaningful   processing using machines of that data, right. So the SIEM   doesn't work. So why don't we create a new industry called EDR,   we're going to ask customers to put yet another agent on the   endpoint. We're going to collect a lot of data from the endpoint,   we're going to process the data with whatever machine learning   static accruals maybe we'll put some people on it. We're going to   find that things generate even more alerts because there aren't   enough alerts already, and maybe sometimes we're going to respond   back to the endpoint. Now that's not enough. We have to do the   same thing with the network. So there is a whole industry called   NTA network traffic analysis that's doing that on the network   stenting the collect deeper data from the network using separate   into in other data lake process that with rules and whatever and   machine learning and then maybe respond back usually they   generate just more or less in the same thing happens for IoT is   and the same thing happens for public cloud. And the same thing happens for South and I'm sure that with   every new challenge. The industry is going to generate yet in   other vertical that's going to collected another separate set of   data and all of that because the doesn't do anything. Okay. We   think that this doesn't make sense like specifically doesn't make   sense like why would you limit yourself to collecting their the   only from the endpoint process data just on the endpoint and   respond back, to the endpoint. We think there has to be something much better than that and   that's what Cortex is about, OK. Now maybe before that this is a   survey that Demisto company we acquired which late year. Before   we acquired them, you've heard it before an average enterprise   has to do with $174,000 per weeks. Usually they have the capacity   to handle may be 12,000 and even that gives them a few seconds   for each alert. It doesn't make sense that leads to at least four   days of investigating the alerts, so they figure out that they   need to investigate and some alerts that just don't touch are the   real alerts that they need to handle and we have to fix that and   that what Cortex XDR is about. And to do that, I'll go to my product guy, tell you how we're   --. So if we think about securing the future, we're really   talking about collecting good data, [Indecipherable] analytics   against it, leveraging as much automation as we can, because   manual work can be error-prone obviously it takes too much time   et cetera. But ultimately, we're trying to get to a proactive   outcome, trying to get away from the reactive something bad has   happened, let me figure out how bad it was and when it happen and   things like that to proactive, how do we actually prevent the bad   things from happening. So using that as a framework, it all starts with good data.   There is a massive amount of money that is being spent on   collecting logs and alerts, but not on selecting good data. You   have to collect good data in order to drive good analytics AI   machine learning and things like that. Now, to get the good data   we of course started with the best sources we know. Our next-gen   firewall crops in the endpoint, so our cloud services, we know,   because we can control those as sources. The kind of data, the   rich detail we can get in order to drive analytics. So that is   where we started. But now we are starting to extend that out to   third-party sources as well. As far the start of -- starting   point for that, it will be other network security devices. We're   going to start with checkpoint and probably on the Cisco and   other things like that. Because again in the enterprise, there is   still a bit of a mess, there is lots of different things, and so   while we try to move everyone to a better state we can help by at   least taking in that data correlating et cetera. So we are starting to now pull in third -party data to augment   our data sources to be able to drive good analytics. So what is   good analytics look like? Well, good analytics, first and   foremost, should be capable of detecting attack that otherwise   can't be detected, Cortex XDR does that for sure. In addition to that though, analytics is very powerful in   being able to reduce the amount of noise and alerts enterprises   have to deal with. We have seen in certain environments up to 50x   reduction of alerts by being able to just simply group them into   incidents to be able to then investigate incidents as opposed to   lots of alerts. We've also then seen the ability to reduce the   amount of time significantly and how long it takes to investigate   an incident by pre-stitching data together and showing the full   view to the analyst it is much, much more powerful and easy for   them to go through the investigation get to conclusion and   ultimately provide automation. Our aspiration here is to get orders of magnitude improvement   even from this, which by the way to the SOC, this is a massive   improvement for they otherwise are. And we're going to keep   focusing on driving these better outcomes. Now, good data to good   analytics, ultimately two really good automation. Automation is   where we can take a lot of the noise out of the system and really   lead the SOC counts, with just what they need to be able to have   to focus on. And again you can see the level of alert reduction   by simply automating the investigation response that humans don't   have to do the work. Improving the risk, the meantime to respond   some environments well north of 90% improvement, and how long it   takes to respond to incidents. That is massive benefit to an   enterprise to the SOCs. And going forward we have a view that we can even make this   automation predictive in nature. But based on everything that we   see across this growing ecosystem, we can build the network   effect, as we have done in many other areas. So that we actually   will be able to tell customers, this is what you should do in   order to achieve these outcomes. The security industry, the   cybersecurity industry needs to get more opinionated about how to   achieve the right outcomes as opposed to simply providing tools   and that customer is kind of do what they want with them.   Automation is a key area for this. Lastly, to bring this together, we are ultimately trying to   get to a proactive response footprint where again instead of   reactive or proactive. This is why traps on the endpoint is so   important to have Cortex function. Not only does it provide   really rich deep data in order to drive analytics and other   things like that, but it can actually prevent attacks from   happening in the first place. Every attack that is prevented   upfront means fewer and fewer alerts that even have to be   analyzed on the back end. Additionally, this is the footprint   that allows us to when we do finish -- when customer does finish   investigation, we can actually then automate the response back to   an enforcement point to take action. So we prevent on the front   end, provide rich data and then ultimately prevent on the   back-end as well. So we can automate that entire sequence. So we bring this together, each one of these components is in   itself best in class. But importantly, integrated together to   form the foundation of a platform, they can solve a lot of the   challenges that Nir talked about, that the SOCs currently deals   with, and are growing. So let's hear from one of our customers as   they talk about their adoption of Cortex and what would have   meant to them. [Video Presentation] Always cools and you can secure a state. And, of course, all   of this adds up to a large and growing town. The combination of   endpoint protection, analytics, automation and, maybe most   obvious, in this case, the ability then reduce the manual   outsourcing and pull that into product automation analytics as   well is the substantial opportunity we see it as well. And for that -- with that, like to invite Nikesh back up to   talk about execution. Nikesh?  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Well, thank you, Lee and Nir. So, as I mentioned, we spend a   lot of time making sure we get our product strategy right, and   Lee and Nir, have highlighted where we plan to go. I hope you   didn't miss the fact that Lee is committed publicly to deploying   a lot of subscriptions in our firewalls and potentially applying   SD-WAN across every form factor. I'm just trying to make sure he   hears me, safe to use, so that I can make sure I can hold him   too. And we also talked about ingesting third-party data into   Cortex, which is an extension of our vision of our Application   Framework from the past. But product is just part of our   solution. Once you get product right, you've got to make sure you   have the execution capability to put the product out in the   market. And, as I've analyzed enterprise companies, it's very   interesting, there is very few very large enterprise companies   and many small enterprise companies. And it's interesting, if you   look at them, there is a distribution engine that needs to be   created just commensurate with your product capacity. Companies   get started, they get into a very good state with one set of   products and then either you have to keep innovating and adding   more product to the portfolio with the salespeople or you have to   acquire product and be able to ingest it in a way that your   salespeople are going to sell it. There is only one way to double   revenue, it's a double number of salespeople and make sure there   is enough capacity in the market, or make sure you double the   amount of product that a salesperson can sell and is able to sell   to be able to do that. Our intent is to do a little bit of   both. And what I wanted to highlight is, in addition to product   capability, we've also been working on our execution capability   and making sure we have the go-to-market. As Lee and Nir just   highlighted, and I ended my last session with saying, we can   address the $73 billion market. This is how that market breaks   out, we think there is a $27 billion opportunity in network,   approximately $8 billion in cloud, $13-odd billion in SOCs and   endpoint protection, and about $25 billion in the automation,   which needs to be deployed across all of those categories. It's a   slightly different view than you will see in the industry. The   industry still believe that it's going to be a very large   services market. We, on the contrary, believe that the services   market is important for the architectural pieces to get   cybersecurity, right, but if you need a lot of people to be able   to manage security for large enterprises on a long-term, that is   not going to give you the automation and the right outcomes and   it's going to require way too much time, while the adversaries   are working on automating their ability redact [Phonetic] you and   get to your precious data. So, as you see, we have 65,000 customers and we have an   amazing brand which people trust. Just to highlight, one of the   first subscriptions we launched early this year, we've been able   to deploy it to over 500 customers in a very short period of   time. So our sales teams know how the moment when you deploy a   subscription they're able to add it to our firewall capability   and get deployed in the market. As Lee talked about our IoT   capability, we want to make that available to every one of our   enterprise firewall customers, and one of you asked me, why   wouldn't to go acquire a more complex IoT company, there are some   larger companies in the IoT space that solve complex used cases.   I understand why as a start-up, you would go after a complex used   case because that's probably where the large deals are. But the   enterprise IoT is a need for every customer. Our salespeople know   how to sell it. We know how to attack the store of firewall. And   our aspiration is that, for every subscription that we deployed,   we should be able to get to thousands of customers, if not, tens   of thousands of customers in a two- to three-year timeframe,   which allows us to keep expanding both TAM and our revenue in a   leveragable way with our customer base. If you look at our current capabilities, we have 4,000   partners, we operate across 150 countries and we have 3,000   people out in the field, which makes us the largest pure play   cybersecurity sales team out in the field. We want to turn that   into a large distribution capability. We also believe that we   have built the best execution team in cybersecurity. I know many   of wrote in your notes about the management turnover at Palo Alto   Networks. Palo Alto Networks have build a phenomenal company,   which is firewall-centric, and we had done some stuff in the   cloud and some stuff in the SOCs. It is very important as we go   through this transition of building a multi-product,   multi-platform cybersecurity business that our management team   represents our capabilities which are required to be able to sell   multiple platforms in the market. And what we have done over time   is we've made sure that we are managing the transition and   upgrading our skill set for our team to make sure that we can   actually go sell cloud, we can go sell automation, we can go sell   AIML, we can go sell firewalls. I joined Google when there were 450 people in Google Europe.   We took that team from 450 people to 5,000 and we quintupled   revenue in five years when I was there. I left Google. Google is   now in its fourth generation of management today and they far   surpassed the quintupling of revenue from the early days. There   were 100,000 employees. So, as you go through evolution, you have   to make sure you bring your management teams and locks them. And   we're very comfortable that the transitions we are doing on the   management front are the continuation of our desire to build the   best execution. Rest assured, most of these management turnover   you're seeing, they're all managed transitions, they're all   toward the purpose of building this multi-capability   cybersecurity sales team. And you can see that we did our first   $1 billion billing this quarter in Q4, while we were going   through these transitions, which tells you that it would be a   very strong field sales force and they're all on-board with our   desire and ambition to build the best cybersecurity player in the   world. In the last year, we've hired over 2,000 cybersecurity   professionals. We have expanded our hiring limit, we now hire   from 19 cloud and next generation companies as opposed to purely   enterprise hardware businesses, which had been a lot of our core   sales team in the past. And we built technology, which allows us   to cross train our teams in cloud and in automation techniques.   This allowed us to train 3,000 people in a week to be able to   sell cloud. Why this is interesting is, this is an important   slide. This is what we anticipate in terms of how we are going to   take this and build this into the larger enterprise security   business. There we do it is, we ingest or innovate and build   technology, we put them in speedboats. We have a speedboat for   cloud, we have a speedboat for automation. We also started training our core sales team out in the field.   And this gives you a sense of what proportion of our field sales   force is able to sell our various products. So we've taken Prisma   Access and 60% of our sales teams out in the field is now able to   sell Prisma Access. This gives us huge amplification and   leverage, Prisma Cloud is closing in on 30%, 35% of our sales   force. And by the end of the year, we will have integrated   Twistlock and PureSec, allowing it to be part of the Prisma Cloud   platform, which will integrate seamlessly both from a contractual   and from a usage perspective. So every Prisma Cloud customer will   automagically have container and serverless capability and we   believe that leverage is going to allow us to address 40% of our   customer base. Our plan is to get our speedboat teams to be able   to sell to 90% of our entire -- through 90% of our core sales   force to our customer base, allowing us to leverage and the   distribution we need to become the biggest player, both in cloud,   as well as automation and SOC. No other player in our space has over 3,000 people in the   field out there selling. Not just that, we want to make sure we   do this while we continue to delight our customers. So we have   been able to maintain the leadership position and customer   happiness and customer success out of the market. Not only that,   we are not going to rest on our laurels. We have just announced   to our field team, we are introducing an industry first security   incident assurance service, whereby, if any of our customers   unfortunately is in a breach situation or any customer in the   industry, we're going to be there available until their breach is   resolved, irrespective of other what proportion of their products   of Palo Alto products. So, we continue to want to be at the   forefront of customer success and customer happiness in our   ability to execute. So with that, I now -- yes, there has been other conversation   about the channel. I think there was one meeting we had with the   Channel Advisory Board, which I think every analyst has feedback   on, anything for team, I have said that we've been tweaking our   channel ball with just causing consternation. But this is just to   give you comfort that 99% of our business still comes from the   channel. And as you can see in Q3 and Q4, because we revamped our   channel programs to create more capability, training and   incentive for our channel, the channel sourced business that   we're doing has never been greater than we've had in the last two   quarters at Palo Alto Networks. So, any noise around the fact of   channel and us are not together in this journey to building the   best cybersecurity business is just noise. We believe the true   signal is that, it's shown in the results. They're actually   allowing us to amplify our capability and they're really excited   about our newer acquisitions and the direction we're taking with   the various platforms. Okay. All right. This is all [Indecipherable]. Sorry, he has   taken us a long to get here. But until we give you a context,   it's very hard for us to take you to what do you're here for. So   with that, as you know, we've had a long history of success. We   have increased market share network security despite popular   belief that we're not going to be able to grow our security   business at twice the rate of the industry. The team and I spent   a lot of time over the last three or four months, looking at do   we need to go through our financial model transition at Palo Alto   Networks and have -- many of your notes about the two these   depression of cash flows duration what is Palo Alto going to do,   vis-a-vis ARR versus the term license or perpetual license. We   tested the market we talked to many of our customers. We talked   to many of the customers -- many of the company is going through   a transition and we're not going through any major financial   transition. Our customers like the way we sell our products for them, our   sales people understand how to sell products to themselves. We   are going to be selling firewalls the way we've been selling them   so far. We are not going to go to any term license model, we're   going to stick with the perpetual license model. And some of our   star [Phonetic] perform factors with sale and replaced firewalls   are going to be sold like firewall has sold. So based on all the   analysis, [Indecipherable] we will be building, a huge capability   to sell our next-generation security, we feel very comfortable   that we will be able to maintain the 20% billings growth rate   over the next three years, as well as a 20% revenue growth rate   over the next two years. I had the privilege over the last three weeks of looking at   every one of your models. I read almost every one of your notes,   and I can safely say, that this 20% guidance is above the average   of most of the models out there on the Street, both in revenue   and billings. But we stand behind the commitment that we believe   we can grow our billings and revenue at roughly 20% growth rate   going forward. An important part, I'd like to highlight one of   the shifts we are seeing, I'm sure you guys pay attention to   product revenues for the [Indecipherable]. We are seeing a shift   where we're replacing our competitors firewalls boxes with   software form factors of Prisma access. So what we've done is   we've taken our VM's, our Prisma access sales and our firewall   sales and said, what would it look like if we consider them all   as an upfront sale and how would our revenues or how would our   billings look like in the firewall category. So this is a combination of VMs, Prisma Access and firewalls.   We feel very comfortable that we will be able to grow the   firewall as a category billings by 23% over the next two years.   Which we believe is still 2.5 times the industry growth rate   vis-a-vis our firewalls are sold, then we think about product. I   will sure point you to the fact that because we anticipate a   large proportion of future firewall sales to be in the software   form factor. There will be a revenue recognition mix shift, which   will come through. But we still believe the category will grow at   23% over the next three years. Talking about the part, that we're really excited about,   really excited about our next generation security billings. We   were able to achieve $452 [Phonetic] million in billings in   Prisma and Cortex. So, what we call next-generation security.   We're guiding to $800 million to $810 million of billings for FY   ' 20 and we believe we will get to $1.75 billion by FY '22,   resulting in revenue of approximately over $1 billion for next   generation security revenue by FY '22. This is the part it takes   some spending to drive that fast revenue growth but FY '20 -- FY   '19 we've been able to manage the acceleration of our Prisma and   Cortex revenues by being able to reallocate from our core   business. We believe that we need to invest between $100 million   to $125 million next year to keep driving that revenue growth at   the pace we're committing to. But we believe thereafter, we will   be able to keep getting operating margin leverage by 150 basis   points in '21 and '22 and we believe the long-term operating   margin for our business should be 25%. I know you've been discussing cash flow a lot about us. We   feel comfortable, despite these investments, despite the shift   toward more services like software-based services and Prisma   access and VMs as well as cortex. We believe we will safely be   able to generate $4 billion of free cash flow over the next three   years, guiding to a long-term free cash flow margin of 30%. So before I talk about how we think about this, I thought it   would be important also to tell you how we intend to use the   cash. What we've done on M&A, as you've seen, there was a   fear when I came to a month ago that this guy comes from Google   is going to spend a lot of money and buy a lot of big stuff. Let   me highlight the key tenants of my M&A philosophy. First and   foremost, I prefer avoiding overlapping products. Overlapping   products are dangerous. We have products in most categories. I'm   not interested in buying other endpoint company, I'm not   interested in buying the firewall company, because that requires   [Indecipherable] basis, two sets of customers and is no leverage   for me, it's much more interesting for us to create innovation in   the category and displace those competitors as opposed to acquire   them, and just create scale. We believe we have scale in most of   our categories, hence we don't need to acquire customers of   overlapping product categories. We prefer targeting Blue Oceans. We like areas where there is   not enough people, we like areas where we can ingest technology   and deployed through our large distribution base, as opposed to   go and participate in valuations, where there is a lot of blood   [Phonetic] and not enough profitability. We seek technology that   will integrate across our platforms. If you look, we acquired   RedLock or emerging RedLock and Twistlock into a common platform.   We acquired PureSec, which is serverless to be integrated as   well. We would acquiring IoT which will be integrated into our   firewall capabilities, we acquired Demisto and which is being   integrated into Cortex. So we prefer acquiring technologies we believe fill an   important gap and also provide leverage to our go-to-market   engine, because if you acquired disparate products, then you have   to go train your sales forces on different go-to-market   capabilities and different USPs for our customers. We prefer   acquiring product excellence versus revenue, because they have to   be at large multiple for revenue, that rather not, rather   acquire, somebody has built a great product and it has good early   customers exhibiting product market fit. Every one of our   companies that we've acquired and I will talk about the slide in   a second. And last but not the least, we focus on large TAMs.   We're not interested in small towns unless there can be   subscriptions, which can be added to our firewalls, which allows   us to consolidate the enterprise. So with that strategy in mind, our approach in the first nine   months, we force our teams to right integrated product lens in   fact Zingbox, and Asheem already started talking about what the   product integration could look like, because our first and   foremost intent was to make sure that integration is done ASAP.   We see as soon as we acquire -- one of these good technology best   of breed companies are able to improve their business plan by   approximately 40%, which is what we've been able to do with the   Demisto pure sectors -- RedLock and many of our acquisitions. And we let their teams run their plays in the market with   go-to-market support from our speedboats. Beginning [Phonetic]   month 9 and 24, we start introducing them through our speedboats   to our core business, allowing us to get more leverage and more   scale across the acquisitions and we target doubling their plans.   Because of that, past 24 months, they become multiple accretive   to us as a business, that's a M&A philosophy, that should   give you a good sense of how we intend to use some of that cash   flow and as Lee and Nir have talked about, we are going to   constantly make build versus buy decision, so we can deliver best   of breed to our customers. And if you believe that we   [Indecipherable] not going to get there fast enough we'll make   acquisitions, but the acquisition will be guided by the   philosophy I just laid out, in terms of smart product teams. And   what is delightful is, I was just sitting early, I'm trying to   count. Of all the acquisitions -- we have over 12 founders working in   our company in our product organization from 12 months ago and   they are all committed to be here over the next two to three   years as part of Palo Alto Networks, so we make that a condition   of our position. So they're supposed to stay there and we   actually let them run their products, because we believe the fact   that they were able to go out against all odds and build the   great product and build a great business, it is incumbent and   imperative that we let them run that product for us at Palo Alto   Networks and to create the right circumstances, the right   capabilities for them to make that happen. So that's our plan in   M&A. So I thought what I would do is -- I would do what you   guys would do and see how do we compare against the industry. We   believe we are already the largest cybersecurity company and   we're growing faster than anybody else in our space. But this is   only half interesting. I find us even more interesting. If you take Prisma and Cortex which is our next generation   security business. In the last 12 months, we grew our billings by   89%. The next 12 months we're forecasting a 78% growth, which we   believe makes us the largest next generation security company,   compared to all the people out there who enjoy robust valuation.   I will leave the word robust. If you look at our forecast for FY'22, we believe we'll be   almost twice as big as any next generation security company in   our Prisma and Cortex category, while we're able to maintain our   firewall business generating huge amounts of cash flow. So, I like to call this a ServiceNow slide. I also reviewed   many Analyst Day presentations, and ServiceNow is kind enough to   build this slide and I understand this is where analysts geek   out, where this is something called the Rule of 40. You add your   cash, free cash flow margins and revenue growth and for some   interesting reason, over 40% is good and below 40% is bad. The   only problem is, ServiceNow left us out of this slide. Probably   we're not the -- we're the old 40 [Indecipherable] firewall   company, we're not the next generation security company, but we   decided to make our own version of the slide, so at least we feel   happy only look at this. And we're delighted to see that we rank   second from the left based on our last 12-month performance, and   we hope to stay far above that median of 38% over the next three   years. So with that, this is what we expect from our Company in   FY'22. We expect a 20% CAGR for total billings and total revenue   over the next three years. We expect to get to $6 billion in   total billings and $5 billion in total revenue by FY'22. We   expect that $1.75 billion of that total billings will come from   our next generation security services and approximately $1   billion of that will be revenue in FY'22. We expect to get back   to our current operating margins by FY'22 with a long-term target   of 25%. And we expect to generate $4 billion of free cash flow by   FY'22. So from here simple matter of execution. With that, let me call my friend, Kathy, who can give you more   specific guidance for FY'20 and for Q1.  Kathy Bonanno    --   Chief Financial Officer  Okay. Thank you, Nikesh. All right. So that's a lot, talked a   lot about fiscal 2022 and about what we see in the coming years.   Let me just put a finer point on what we expect for fiscal   2020. So, am I moving these slides or somebody else? Okay. Since   it's a lot of data and information on the screen and these slides   will be made available to you, I'm going to focus primarily on   talking about the year-over-year growth rates. We will make these   slides available to you following the call. So for fiscal Q1   FY'20, we expect billings growth to be between 15% to 17%   year-over-year. We expect revenue growth of 16% to 17%   year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of   $1.02 to $1.04, which incorporates net expenses related to   acquisitions, including the Zingbox proposed acquisition, which   we've just announced. For the full-year of fiscal 2020, we expect billings to   increase between 17% to 19% year-over-year and we expect revenue   growth to be in the range of 19% to 20% year-over-year. As Nikesh   mentioned, next-gen security billings growth is expected to be in   the range of 77% to 79% year-over-year. We expect fiscal 2020   non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $5 to $5.10, which also   includes net expenses related to our recent acquisitions. And   finally, turning to free cash flow, we expect adjusted free cash   flow margin of approximately 30% for fiscal 2020. In this slide presentation, you will also find some additional   modeling points related to CapEx estimate, share count, tax rate,   the impact of M&A on EPS. I'm not going to read them to you,   but once again we'll make that available to you. So finally, we've summarized our fiscal 2022 guidance for you   as well on the screen, Nikesh already covered this, but hopefully   the format for fiscal 2022 will be easy for you to digest. And I   don't think it's on the screen, so perhaps -- yeah, perhaps I   should move it since I'm holding the clicker in my hands, sorry.   So, while we are investing to capture significant market   opportunity and we do see a gradual shift in durations, we expect   it to be gradual associated with changing mix of our products   toward more cloud and SaaS delivered products. As Nikesh   mentioned, we're not anticipating a big bang event. And so, for   the years beyond fiscal 2022, we're targeting our operating   margins to be above 25% and free cash flow margins at least 30%   or greater. So that hopefully will put some of your minds at ease. That   concludes our prepared remarks. And now we'll turn up the lights   and be happy to address any of your questions. Nikesh?  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Are you guys happy? Come on give her a round of applause.   Tough crowd.  Kathy Bonanno    --   Chief Financial Officer  Okay. We have people running mics. So I see some   questions. Questions and Answers:  David Niederman    --   Vice President of Investor Relations  Please state your name and your firm before you state your   question, please.  Jonathan Ho    --   William Blair & Company -- Analyst  Thank you. This is Jonathan Ho from William Blair. One of the   questions I had is regarding the next-generation growth, can you   unpack for us a little bit of the components that you see from   that next-gen side? And maybe how much that ties to the   investments that you're making? Thanks.  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Yeah. Look, we're not going to break down the individual   components just yet. But in terms of the investment, we -- as I   mentioned, we've moved 1,000 people through acquisitions or   through organic hiring. We've taken our Prisma and Cortex or   next-generation security team to about 1,500 people out of 7,000   people. The highlights we ended FY'19 with. We anticipate adding   more people into those categories, both for R&D and for   sales. We feel reasonably comfortable that our core team is   robust in the size. So we'll be making small additions to our   core team but mostly we're focusing some of our newer hires into   Prisma and Cortex. Some of that spending is also a full year   impact of what we already invested going into Q3 and Q4 of this   year. So some of it is a follow on from Q3 and Q4 investment,   which we were able to manage with our budget for this year. But   some of it is incremental hiring for Prisma and Cortex. In terms of across the board, I can give you color that Prisma   Cloud is doing phenomenally well for us. It's really -- we need   to be out there in front of our customers a lot more. There is   over 20,000 -- 30,000 people selling public cloud between AWS,   Azure, GCP and Alibaba. There's probably a few hundred cloud   security salespeople in the world. So when we show up and   customers and we show them a demo and saying, look, this is what   you're not doing. They're, oh, yeah, I got to go cover my   security needs and when I write applications, they're just not on   secure themselves. So we're seeing really good traction for   Prisma Cloud. I think Nir made it abundantly clear how excited we are about   Prisma Access and how proxy style securing cloud-native   architectures is not a good idea. So Prisma Access is the huge   focus. Demisto has done well. Post acquisition it has followed   the M&A slide I showed you in terms of expecting to double   their business plan from where they are. So -- and XDR for us has   done really well, because we got 250 customers in the first full   quarter of operation and we continue to see more and more -- with   the addition of third-party data ingestion. And the way we think   about the ingestion, just to clarify, we just don't ingest data,   we make sure analytics engine can ingest that data and provide   analytics and suppress bad alerts and give you good signal and do   data stitching. So, our ingestion philosophy is more a philosophy   which works in building analytics around the data and then   ingesting the [Indecipherable]. So I think across the board we   anticipate robust growth, that's why we're comfortable guiding to   an $800 million to $810 million number.  Kathy Bonanno    --   Chief Financial Officer  A lot of hands going up. Okay. Amber?  Kenneth Talanian    --   Evercore ISI -- Analyst  Hi, Ken Talanian, Evercore ISI. When I look at that $6 billion   billings number, how much of that is from your existing product   set? And what are your assumptions around kind of current   acquisitions going into that and then maybe some of the future   acquisition assumptions that buildup to that?  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Look, as Lee mentioned, that we believe many of the cloud   security products are not fully built in the market from a   maturity perspective. If you look at serverless, serverless we   think is 50% built, we bought PureSec, they have a product   roadmap, which is a robust product roadmap in front of them for   six to nine months. So we believe there will be interesting cloud   security based acquisitions we might have to do in the future,   which will fall in the M&A philosophy we highlighted. So,   some of those bolt-on technology, which haven't been developed or   anticipated, and our desire to build a cloud platforms for the   future. But there is no major plug in that number for us to go   out and acquire revenue to reach that $6 billion number. We feel   we should be able to get there with the majority of the products   we have in place with small bolt-on acquisitions as we see the   industry while the product marketable.  Shaul Eyal    --   Oppenheimer & Co. -- Analyst  Thank you. Shaul Eyal with Oppenheimer. Nikesh, you have put   many concerns to rest course of the past hour, so.  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Thank you.  Shaul Eyal    --   Oppenheimer & Co. -- Analyst  So, one question I had in mind is...  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  But still I won. So go -- everything before the but is to be   ignore. Yeah.  Shaul Eyal    --   Oppenheimer & Co. -- Analyst  As we think about your targets heading toward fiscal 2022 and   above, have you taken into consideration any changes with respect   to channel compensation, partners, anything with a go-to-market?   Or pretty much from our perspective, we should be thinking about   it mostly at a status quo going further?  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  There are no major assumptions in there in changing any   channel behavior in the process. We are seeing more activity in   the channel by telcos and by SIs like the Accenture's and the   Deloitte's of the world or AT&T's of the world or   Telefonica's of the world, they are becoming more active in   cybersecurity. If you look at most of the landscape, every telco,   every consulting organization is building very large   cybersecurity practices because they're trying not only   [Indecipherable] they're building cloud practices. So if you go,   this is the biggest fastest-growing segment of the SI and SP   space. So, yes, we anticipate they will have a bigger role to   play in how we are able to deploy some of our products in the   future. But to us, that's just evolution of channel. If they end   up doing more business, bring us to customers, we'll be there   with them just the way we are with the Optiv's [Phonetic] and   WWT's of today.  Saket Kalia    --   Barclays -- Analyst  Thanks. Saket Kalia from Barclays. Nikesh you talked about no   transition to a term license model, for example, for the firewall   business, which was good to hear. But you also even suggested   that maybe some cloud products could be priced similarly to the   firewall. I think we mentioned that quickly. Could you just give   some examples of that and when that could actually start to   happen?  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  So what I -- sorry, thank you, first of all, asking the   question. I want to make sure I clarify. Sometimes our sales   teams bundle our annual products into three-year deals and sell   them like they would sell it upfront cash payment, which allows   us to get the cash flow just the way we get the cash flow for our   firewall products and roughly -- three years is roughly the term   for our hardware business in terms of contract durations. So   that's all I'm saying that, some of the cloud deal end up being   three-year deals instead of annual deals. So we still get the   benefit of the cash flow, so which is why Kathy alluded to the   fact that we're not anticipating large duration declines over the   next three years. We believe -- I haven't said this yet, but I'm   going to say it, we believe that the duration decline will be   approximately 10% over the next three years and hence, we believe   we are able to deliver -- we will be able to deliver the $4   billion of cash flow over the next three years.  Saket Kalia    --   Barclays -- Analyst  Thanks.  Imtiaz Koujalgi    --   Guggenheim Securities -- Analyst  Hi. It's Imtiaz Koujalgi from Guggenheim. Kathy, if I'm doing   my math right, based on your billings guide for next year and   your billings guide for the next-generation products. If I back   that out, it looks like you're guiding to the core business   growing at about 8% the firewall business, which is a big step   down from the 24% product growth we had this year. Is that the   right way to think about product growth next year in the   high-20s?  Kathy Bonanno    --   Chief Financial Officer  Yeah. I think it's a little bit higher than that, but yes   that's close. The reason that we are looking at this firewall   technology as a group is because we're very excited about what   we're seeing from our customers in terms of demand for both   Prisma Access and our VM series. And so, that security category,   which Nikesh showed up on the slide earlier, we are expecting to   continue to grow at very rapid rates. Now, the mix may change a little bit in between there, but I   think our forecast still holds regardless. And the firewall   security itself, that in line security, that network security is   still a very important component for all of our customers, but we   are seeing great demand and great excitement about what Prisma   Access can do by delivering that security in a cloud form factor   really security-as-a-service. And so, we're very jazzed about our   possibilities going forward in terms of being able to win deals   that would have normally been one with firewalls, hardware with   that particular product and we think that we're the only   competitor that can really offer these various form factors to   our customers. And so, we see a really terrific opportunity.  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Just to elaborate on that for a second. You saw two examples,   one Lee alluded to a very large retailer and we had a video from   another. In both cases we were competing with firewall boxes. And   we went in with Prisma Access with a differentiated strategy.   These are very large deals, as I've mentioned, one of them was   over $10 million, the other one was close. But in both cases, we   were able to displace the hardware form factor for competitors   because competitors did not have a software form factor. The good   news is, the software form factor deployment is a brief. If you   try and deploy a box in 2,000 locations in a retailer, it takes   them a year and a half or two years. The software, we can get   there in three to five months. So, part of what we are trying to do is, we're trying to   actually force that shift toward the software form factor because   as Nir mentioned, we don't believe our competition has the   capability to deliver the solution via the software form factor,   which allows us both to be differentiated, reduce speed of   deployment, allow it to run across hundred on-boarding points   from -- for our customers. So that's part of the assumption,   which you rightfully captured. We're actually trying to engineer   that bigger shift and trying to drive our business more toward   the software form factor.  Imtiaz Koujalgi    --   Guggenheim Securities -- Analyst  Thanks. So, one more follow-up, Kathy. On the long-term   target, comparing what you gave us last time in 2017, you had   free cash flow margins long-term below operating margins. This   time you reversed it, your operating margins long-term are   actually lower than your free cash flow margin targets. What is   driving that reversal? Is it just more recurring revenues?  Kathy Bonanno    --   Chief Financial Officer  Yeah. Can I just clarify? When we're talking about long-term   and I'm glad you asked this so I can get it out there for   everyone to hear. We're talking four to five years, right? And   the previous guidance that we had given, our long-term was much,   much further out when we're sort of growing at the rate of the   market is the way we described it. And at that point in time, we   assumed that we'd be a much greater cash taxpayer. And so, that   was the reason for the lower free cash flow margins. But we're   talking right now long-term for us is about four to five years   out. Okay? Thank you. And I said four to five, not 45. I need to   be very clear and enunciate.  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  45 would be great guidance. All right. Somebody has the mic?   There's question on this slide. David behind you.  Kathy Bonanno    --   Chief Financial Officer  And I saw a woman with her hand up. I want her to get a   question, Fatima. Just don't ask us a hard one now. Just   kidding.  Fatima Boolani    --   UBS -- Analyst  I'll go easy on you. I'm Fatima Boolani from UBS. Just a quick   point of clarification on the mix shift dynamics you're seeing in   the core firewall business, is that a displacement dynamic or are   you seeing the mix shift within the refresh of your own installed   base? I just want to clarify...  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  It's more of a displacement dynamic. I give you one specific   use case, but there are similar use cases in many places where --   whether it's a retailer, whether it's multi-branch situation or   multiple mobile user situation. We have customers with 100,000   employees or more who want to go to a Prisma Access type solution   for the mobile users. So, it's more -- it's mostly a displaced --   mostly a displacement of competition dynamic than it is a refresh   of our data center firewall business.  Fatima Boolani    --   UBS -- Analyst  Understood. So my real question is...  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  I know where you're going, don't worry.  Fatima Boolani    --   UBS -- Analyst  You talked about...  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  I've spent three months pouring over every one of these   numbers of Kathy, so I know exactly where you're going. Please   go.  Fatima Boolani    --   UBS -- Analyst  You talked a lot about automation in each one of the pillars   of your corporate strategy. And so, if I think about your top 25   or your 25th largest customer spending close to $40 million per   annum with you. I mean, how should we think about that with the   automation opportunity and the fact that you expect to double the   size of your business in the next four to five years? I mean,   what are some of the dynamics there if your 25th largest   customers already spending $40 million with you?  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  So, let me use Cortex XDR as a use case, right. We have   thousands of customers who deployed Traps. The version of Traps   four months ago was not collecting data, sending it to a central   data lake, allowing us to do insights and analytics against it.   We are able to go back to every one of those large customers and   allow them to ingest data from there and give -- and upsell them   to Cortex XDR. So this is a use case for us where we take their   firewalls, we take their endpoints and say, why don't you collect   the data across the board, we'll analyze it to you, we'll reduce   the signal-to-noise ratio and we'll couple Demisto with it and be   able to give you automation going forward. So, that's the use case, for example, we can take our firewall   customers, our endpoint customers, add automation to this and   that budget comes out of their SOC budgets, because every one of   our customers is building SOC. SOC is the fastest-growing   category with about 20%-plus growth year-over-year, where people   are deploying more people and more data ingestion and more data   logging spend.  Fatima Boolani    --   UBS -- Analyst  And do you foresee that more coming out of the wallets of   traditional managed security services providers you sort of offer   these Tier 1 type capabilities? And were are those dollars coming   from essentially?  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Those dollars are coming from both SOC dollars, if you will,   there is such a category, but they are also coming from   efficiencies we're able to drive for those SOC owners, we are   saying, we can come in and instead of we put up some interesting   numbers up there, you out 8 times and 50 times in terms of alert   reduction. Traditional approach to alert reduction is hire more   SOC analyst. If he can walk and say, I can reduce the number of   alerts by 8 times and I can the reduce the number of alerts by 50   times, that's a huge amount of savings, which is coming out of   the SOC analysts that people have to hire and very few of our   customers are able to scale up their SOC to hire 300 SOC analysts   because it's kind of very interesting. One thing I learnt, which I can talk about, very few customers   delete policies. They are scare of deleting seven, eight of   firewall policies because somebody wrote them with some wisdom in   mind and the new guys says, oh, I'm not going to delete it. So   there is the poor SOC analyst trying to interpret, why is that an   alert? And the problem is, the alert keeps coming back because   they have no ability to go out and remediate that and fixed that   policy. So part of what Demisto is doing is, OK, we understand   you don't like alerts, so let's automate this so you can start   focusing on stuff that's important. That's why you end up with   that 174,000 alerts and not that I'm a hacker or a bad guy, but   if I understand how you prioritize the important alerts you   should look at, I'll spend my time trying to figure out how to be   under the radar. So part of our philosophy is, we want to look at every alert   out there and the only way he can get there is through   automation. Automation that works in the endpoint, automation   that works in your firewall, automation that works in your SOC,   so that's why if you notice, every one of our products has a   large automation TAM because we believe we're going to take away   from this services is the labor TAMs and put that into   automation.  Fatima Boolani    --   UBS -- Analyst  Thank you so much.  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Amber, in the back.  Sterling Auty    --   J.P. Morgan -- Analyst  Hi, Sterling Auty with J.P. Morgan. So, one question for   Nikesh and Kathy, and if possible, can I throw a follow-up   question to Nir, if he still has his microphone?  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Yeah. Our entire management team is here, of course.  Sterling Auty    --   J.P. Morgan -- Analyst  All right. Fantastic. So Nikesh and Kathy, Nikesh you   mentioned the 10% reduction in duration over the next three   years, how much of that is actually going to be what you're   managing that duration to versus what customers want? Because one   of the positive feedback items that we received through the   channel over the last quarter or so is, finally, Palo Alto being   flexible on payment terms. And if God forbid, we do roll into   some tougher macro economic times, I could see more and more   customers perhaps wanting to only pay a year at a time instead of   three years upfront.  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Kathy, you want to...  Kathy Bonanno    --   Chief Financial Officer  Yeah. We are going to be very thoughtful about those   trade-offs in terms of what sort of financial incentives do we   have to provide in order to have our customers commit to us for a   longer period of time. We talked about last -- that issue last   quarter, and we talked about the fact that we were paying very   close attention to the economics of deals like that where our   customers really wanted to only pay us a year at a time. And   we're going to continue to do that. And if our customers demand   more and more of that, obviously, we will adapt to what our   customers are wanting. But we actually find that there are a lot   of customers who are very comfortable with the way they pay us   today very comfortable with our billing practices to date. And   so, we're not seeing this huge surge of demand. It tends to be   occasional request that we handle on a one-off basis. Potentially   it could become larger in the future and, of course, we'll adapt   to that over time. But the big shift that we've been talking   about -- I'm sorry, Nikesh, is really driven more by the mix   shift of the products and primarily the growth of Prisma Cloud,   which we talked a little bit about last quarter having shorter   contract durations, which we talked about.  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  And sorry, just to add to that, I've discovered over the last   13 months, the industry has certain compensating mechanisms   already in place. And there are customers who want to pay on an   annual basis and the industry -- the channel wants to facilitate   it. They figured it out with some sort of financing and they show   up at our doorstep with the entire contract durations worth of   cash flow. So, it's been around for a very long time, and there   are many enterprise companies which have financing arms and all   different kind of tactics to enable that cash flow generation. So   we haven't assumed any of that stuff, we believe that life will   go on as normal. But I have the inevitable Nir here, you wanted to   question.  Sterling Auty    --   J.P. Morgan -- Analyst  Exactly. The follow-up, Nir, when you were talking about   proxies, you did Gen 1 kind of Gen 2, but when we're thinking   about Prisma and the competition going forward, you didn't really   kind of call out the name. So I want to be very specific in terms   of understanding who you think...  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  You think we didn't call out the name. Okay.  Sterling Auty    --   J.P. Morgan -- Analyst  Nikesh, you touched upon. Who do you think is going to be the   core competition in terms of Prisma Access moving forward? I   mean, we all think probably Zscaler is going to be part of it.   But what about the Akamai and the other companies that are in   that space? And what do you think happens to kind of the   traditional firewall vendors, do they all get squeezed out or do   they come up with offerings as well? Thanks.  Nir Zuk    --   Chief Technology Offcer  Yeah. I -- so I think the competition is Zscaler. However, I   strongly believe that the right architecture and the right   products at the end of the day win. And we've been told that may   be multiple times, right? FireEye, for example, right? A long   time ago, FireEye came out of the market and they had this idea   of running sandboxes and signatures are dead and the entire world   is going to ship to FireEye and some of you even bought that   story, but it was the wrong technical solution. First, sandbox is   not going to replace everything and second, from a technical   perspective, a sandbox needs to do prevention, no detection. It   has to be in line and it has to be across entire infrastructure,   which means it needs to run off the firewall. And that's why they   went their way, we went our way and we all know how it ended up   for both of us. So, I think that we're facing the same situation right now.   There is the right technical way of doing something and the right   way to deliver a product to the market, then there is the wrong   way. And proxies have always been the wrong way and firewalls   have always been the right way, being in the network, part of the   network, being a packet-based device, participating in routing,   participating in network optimization, and being able to support   all applications, not just few applications, not breaking   applications. I don't know if you know, if Microsoft recommends   that when you use Zscaler, you turn -- you don't use Zscaler when   you go to Office 365. Why? Because it breaks Office 365. Because   that's what proxies do. And it's their own technical solution and   I strongly believe that the right technical solution will   win. Now, if you look at what's involved in Access in the modern   access into the cloud and back into the infrastructure -- into   their corporate infrastructure for mobile users and branch   offices, you need to do a lot of different things. And our   competition today, different competitors do different things. I   don't see a single competitor that does both the application   security part of it, the firewall side of it, the CASB side of   it, the SD-WAN part of it, they are back to corporate side of it,   I just don't see anyone that has the complete portfolio to be   able to do what we're talking about. Yes, there are the firewall   vendors, the firewall vendors, like I said, are still busy   figuring out why they can't sell their hardware against ours.   While we've been spending the last several years building our   virtual firewall and building our cloud-delivered firewall to a   point where I just -- it's just -- they are three to five years   behind at least, plus the amount of time they are behind our   hardware firewall is, I just -- I don't see competition from   them.  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Thank you, Nir.  Kathy Bonanno    --   Chief Financial Officer  I'm going to recall...  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  What Nir means to say is, we respect our competition and we   are glad that we're able to build amazingly large businesses and   serve the customers' needs with cybersecurity. I think that's   what he said.  Matthew Hedberg    --   RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst  Matt Hedberg, RBC. It seems like every other question of   investors is macro, you guys delivered strong results, obviously,   some very large deals this quarter and the guidance on a   multi-year view is very strong. I guess, Nikesh, when you're out   talking to executives, what is the pulse of buying behavior out   there right now? And then I have a quick product question for Nir   as well.  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Yeah. What's interesting and maybe I'm going to ask our   President, Amit Singh, who you have not seen in this context. He   can talk more because he has been out there on the road grinding   away. So you guys get to tell the good stories, I get to go out   there in the field and grind. So, let's have you come up.   So...  Kathy Bonanno    --   Chief Financial Officer  Oh boy.  Amit Singh    --   President  Hello, everyone. The climate for cybersecurity is quite   strong, the acquisitions. It's driven by all the challenges you   see in the papers and buying behavior is actually quite solid.   The movement toward software and software-delivered is a real   one, so -- and we are actually very, very excited about the   products that we have, both on the product side, as well as the   service delivery side of it, because these are cloud-delivered   solutions, it's a backdrop that I come from. And interesting, when you look at any trend, whether it's how   many software start-ups were funded, cybersecurity start-ups, all   the way to the actual market spending, it's very, very solid.   Your question was, I think, on the macro picture. We haven't seen   any slowdown. We haven't seen slowdown, you saw some of that   numbers we shared around pipeline, pipeline growth, partner   generation pipeline and clearly, our Q4 performance is a measure   testament of being able to hold the core business, while being   also able to generate brand new businesses and scale them.  Matthew Hedberg    --   RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst  And then maybe just a quick product question. Nir, when you   think about consolidating security spend, what's sort of your   view on identity? It's -- obviously, it's a hot category out   there. What role is identity have in the Palo Alto platform?  Nir Zuk    --   Chief Technology Offcer  Sure. So first, most of our customers integrate our network   security with identity, because identity needs enforcement, and   in most cases, the firewall is going to do a bit of thing that   performs the enforcement. Actually, the only case where it's not   the firewall is when you access SaaS applications. In all other   cases, it's the firewall that enforcing the identity, sometimes   the applications themselves as well. So that's the rough   identity. Now, if you look at the market today, I think most of the   market is focused on what's called hygiene, meaning who can   connect and who cannot connect to an application, which is   interesting but it's becoming commodity. I think the most   interest -- the more interesting part of Identity is identity   analytics. So being able to take identity events and figuring out   attacks from the identity. So that's -- I think that's one area   that's not being addressed today by the market and is an   opportunity. I think that's the other side of identity that is still yet to   be decided by the market is, how do you do machine-to-machine   identity, especially in the cloud. And I think the jury is still   out on that and that's -- that could be one day an interesting   thing to look at.  Philip Winslow    --   Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst  Hi, Phil Winslow, Wells Fargo. Just wanted to focusing on the   firewall platform billing slide and there you break out your   firewall hardware versus Prisma and the VM series, we already --   so we talked a lot about Prisma Access here today, but wanted to   focus my question on the VM series. One of the questions I get a   lot from investors is attach rate of VM series and attach rate of   firewall in the public cloud environment. And so, it's kind of   question to the whole team here is that, one, how are you   thinking about contribution VM series to the forward billings?   But also, where are we in terms of increasing attach rates of VM   series and call it your hybrid cloud, multi-cloud security?  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Quick clarifying question, what you mean the attach of the VM   series?  Philip Winslow    --   Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst  The -- instead of call it like the out-of-the-box firewall   that you got -- get from a cloud vendor, Azure, AWS attaching   actually VM series to that workload and the like.  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  So we're very pleased with the VM series and how it's done.   The -- when it first came out, we were focused on the private   cloud use case because at the time that was the first generation   of cloud, and then it's evolved really well as more workloads   have shifted into public cloud infrastructure. VM series today   supports all of the major cloud vendors in US Azure, GCP,   Alibaba. It's evolved in a number of ways that are very specific   to cloud in terms of how we integrate it with different   orchestration platforms, how would do automation. We're the only   security vendor, for example, especially supported with   Terraform, which is one of the main sort of multi-cloud   automation orchestration tools out there. We are sellable to all   the marketplaces. And we actually have a very nice business and   growing business with VM series being consumed through the   marketplaces. So, there is a lot of really good things that are   happening there. The -- I'd say, the only sort of challenge that -- may not the   only challenge, but big challenge relative to your question is, a   lot of companies will first try to get by without real security.   And the -- through various mechanisms and often is through   unfortunate events where something bad happens to a company that   triggers the people to actually really go back and pay attention.   But that's the only challenge is sort of getting people over the   hump of trying the thing that they think might be good enough   before they realize that what they really need is best-in-class   security and understand that we can do the cloud integration   aspects that they also knew. Okay? A question here.  Karl Keirstead    --   Deutsche Bank -- Analyst  Great. Karl Keirstead at Deutsche Bank. First of all, Nikesh   for a guy who a year ago said that you no longer giving annual   guidance only next quarter, thank you for the reversal.  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Appreciate it. I'll -- adaptive dynamic earn. Yes.  Karl Keirstead    --   Deutsche Bank -- Analyst  I wanted to, let's say, stress test your confidence in 20%   billings and revenue growth over the next three years. And, I   guess, I'm saying this in the context of you having just put up a   quarter where you grew both metrics by 22%. So you just put up   22% and you're saying you're going to grow 20% for the next   three. At first that sounds a little bit optimistic, especially   given that you're on stage as well talking about a hardware to   software form factor shift, which if we look at firms like F5 and   others that are going through this. It tends to be quite dilutive   to your overall growth rate. So, is it that that form factor   shift you expect only to be quite gradual and you can kind of   skate around it? Or is it that you're emerging products are just   growing so damn fast, but despite that you can still get to 20%?   Thank you.  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  First of all, thank you, Karl. If I'm allowed to clarify, I   was not comfortable giving guidance when I walked in because I   didn't understand the levers of the business. Not did I   understand the industry and nor did I understand the levers of   the Company, and I hate to stand up on stage and comment on   behalf of 7,000 people without having some degree of confidence   and comfort in our ability to deliver. So, I appreciate you guys   and during the last one year of our quarterly guidance, but I   think hopefully we have given more guidance and put a large news   around our necks. Now, we have to go out and deliver this stuff.   So, thank you for reminding me of that. In terms of our comfort level, I want to parse your question   into two or three parts. One part is, we are seeing unabated   growth in cloud, generally and I alluded to the fact that there   is not enough cloud security out there and there has not been   enough people enumerating the need for cloud security. I will not   take the name of the customer but there has been a recent breach,   where it was a cloud breach. And I can tell you that got the   phones ringing because people suddenly realized that you can have   cloud breaches, even though you are using a public cloud   provider, security cannot be used as an open source set of tools.   You have to go find a security product to secure cloud instances   as you start putting more and more important crown jewel data out   there. So, we believe that that's going to drive more of the VM use   case, we believe that's going to drive a lot of the Prisma cloud   use case. We're also seeing -- as the question was asked and then   Amit answered. We're also seeing a lot of rearchitecting going on   as people go through their rearchitecting of enterprise. If you   look at companies, right, there is no CIO out there who is not   thinking about how do I go to the cloud. So this is very   important. So if I'm going to the cloud what do I do with my   enterprise IT, what do I do with my security? How do I rethink   it? And as they're rethinking it, they're rethinking their   branches. You go to a retailer, retailer needs to put a lot of   bandwidths into their branches. In the past, there was little   bandwidth, you needed your POS systems to work, all that's you   needed. Today, they want AR and VR in the store. They want to   move customer data back and forth, suddenly they need security in   the store. So we believe there is some degree of new use cases   being created, which is driving some of the confidence we have in   some of our newer services. And we believe our core business   continues to be strong. The underlying core business and the   customer base continues to be strong. We fully realize that we   are going roughly from, let's say, $3.5 billion number to a $6   billion number, which means we have to kind of double, as I've   said, there's only one way to double, have more product or have   twice as many salespeople, I hope that there is twice many   customers out there that you can get. So we think the balance is   right and we should be able to execute. We've done a lot of   investing in FY'19 in Q3 and Q4 and ramping up both our core   capability as of some of our speedboat capability, now we're   stretching our team has got to deliver. We'll give it our best   shot.  Pierre Ferragu    --   New Street Research -- Analyst  Pierre Ferragu, New Street. Nikesh, first of all --. Pierre   Ferragu, New Street. Nikesh, first of all, thank you very much   for not changing your business model. It took me a very long time   to figure it out and I spent [Speech Overlap]  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  It taken me 12 months to figure out, then I had to go figure   out what the other guys [Speech Overlap]  Pierre Ferragu    --   New Street Research -- Analyst  [Speech Overlap] what have done so far. That's great. And it   gives me the opportunity to ask more of a product question to   Nir. And so, you explained very well how you plan to completely   crush all proxy-based competitors. And I was wondering, and   you've defended it very well all the -- all what you have already   in your development in the next-generation firewall and all what   you've done from there. But I was wondering how you transfer that   benefit to technologies you're acquiring. So, for instance, if we   look at the components of Prisma Cloud, when they came in first   day what did you do? How did you integrate their technologies   with your existing technology? How did they benefit from that?   And then your clients using it, how does it benefit from having a   Palo Alto Networks firewall and having Prisma Cloud in the same   environment?  Lee Klarich    --   Chief Product Officer  Yeah. Thank you for the question. So, Nikesh mentioned a   couple of the principles that we now apply more vigorously in   terms of the incoming companies, level responsibility we give   them, the expectations we put on the founding teams of these   companies to continue to execute, as well as to build an   integration plan. And it's interesting you asked about Prisma   Cloud, that was formed out of the basis of two acquisitions,   Evident.io and RedLock. The integration of those two together   took us about four months. Four months to integrate two products   into a single platform. It now forms the foundation where we'll   be able to then further integrate Twistlock and PureSec into that   platform continue to extend it out. Again, pulling the leadership   teams of the companies into this together in order to make sure,   and then building an execution plan that includes the integration   that we all agree on very quickly after the acquisitions happen.   And we're very much in the midst right now of executing on that   with an expectation that by the end of this calendar year those   will now be new modules in the Prisma Cloud platform. So, a lot of this is around giving the right people the right   responsibility, the right accountability and then executing. And   we're showing that we can do this a very good success. On the   customer side then, what they're seeing is, very easy adoption of   additional cloud security capabilities showing up in the same   platform that they're already used to. They simply get to consume   and deploy against our cloud workloads, which is a very powerful   a go-to-market and adoption aspect that the products are   enabling.  Nir Zuk    --   Chief Technology Offcer  Yeah. Another example will be XDR. So we bought an EDR   company, we bought in NTA company, right, Secdo and LightCyber   and integrated both together. Nobody believed we can do that.   Nobody believed we can take network data, take endpoint data,   combine them together and generate meaningful analytics based on   that. And we're the first one to do it, and like I said, EDR, NTA   as their -- and they're don't make sense and now we're going to   integrate -- we plan to integrate more and more things into   it. Now, the other type of integration that we have, which I think   we partly ask about is, when we buy someone like Zingbox, or we   develop something like DNS security, it becomes a service that is   attached to our firewall. And all the customer has to do to use   it is to flip a switch. You flip a switch and you use the   service, and you test it for a week, a month, whatever, you like   it you buy it, you don't like it, you don't buy. And most   customers, they're turning to and they see things that they just   can't not buy the product. And the interesting thing is that,   those services apply to all form factors. So if you have a   physical firewall, you do that, if you bought Prisma Access, you   turn in and you do that. If you went with a competitor, with a   proxy competitor and you want to do IoT security in the branch,   which you do, like you need to secure printers and you probably   have IP phones and video cameras and other things connected to   the network in the branch, what do you do? You have to go to an   IoT security company, you have to the buy their product, you have   to deploy it in the branch and you have to do deploy it in 2,000   branches, if you have 2,000 real points and somehow   operationalize it. With Palo Alto Networks, if you are a Prisma   Access customer already, you turn on a switch, immediately it   applies to all your branches, you like it you buy it, you don't   like it you don't buy it. It's that simple. Okay?  David Niederman    --   Vice President of Investor Relations  There are other question right next to the gentlemen.  Keith Bachman    --   BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst  Hi, it's Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Nikesh and Kathy   for you, is M&A inclusive or exclusive of what you just put   up on the board? And what I mean by that is, as we think about   the revenue outlook and billing outlook, I assume that the   context of that is mostly smaller deals probably don't move the   M&A, but I just wanted to see if you could clarify. And it   relates to you as well Kathy on the margins, this year you're   suggesting that margins go lower but thereafter, they'll move   higher. And so, is that again M&A neutral? So if you do some   deals you might ask for forgiveness for the margin growth that   you're suggesting in the outer years if in fact you do pursue   M&A even some smaller deals that might pressure those margin.   So, inclusive or exclusive is the shorter question of   M&A?  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  So to give you a framework, it's exclusive of any large   M&A, which has a significant revenue acquisition component.   So, if you go buy a company for $100 million of revenue, where --   that's not part of our plan, as I said to the gentleman earlier,   there is no plug in these numbers that we're going to be   acquiring $200 million, $300 million revenue growing at 50%   right, that is not a bad stuff. We're not looking for M&A as   a strategy. We're looking as platform as a strategy. Now, in the platform context, if you think about, are we   better off going back and, for example, we built Cortex XDR from   the acquisitions. We've put it -- we got the teams to integrate.   We didn't sell it for six months. We got them to integrate and   sold it after. They put it together. Twistlock, RedLock, PureSec,   we integrated and we're deploying it across our platform. So if   you find there is a product need and a product market fit that   needs to be integrated across the platform that stuff will have   to be acquired and we'll keep you posted as we acquire them, what   the impacts of those are financially. We have not built any   expectation saying we're going to be doing $500 million of   acquisitions every year and it's going to have certainly EPS   impact, we're going to take that and take into these numbers.   These are raw numbers, organic, Kathy has told you FY'20 has a   $45 million M&A for this year, after one year we roll that   into our organic numbers. So FY'21, 2022 there's no -- there'll   be unless we do something between now and then there is -- those   will become organic numbers. One thing I think there was a clarification question which I   want to announce publicly, somebody asked a question about the   duration of 10%, is that every year or across three years? The   answer is over three years, not every year. I'm trying to keep my friends out of jail, I heard that   broadband is poor in Jail, so. And still on MPLS.  Michael Turits    --   Raymond James -- Analyst  Sounds good idea. My wife just watching the [Indecipherable]   black last night. So I don't want you there. Michael Turits from   Raymond James. Question on -- for Nir and Lee, you guys talked   about SD-WAN and SD-WAN is big and a big part of what Fortinet   has been talking about for some time. So I'm trying to think   about, first of all, how do you become an SD-WAN player? What are   you going to do with it? Is it similar I think to what Fortinet   is doing and saying, hey, we can do this too and function the   SD-WAN? Or are you going to use it to help improve GlobalProtect   cloud services networking component, because that's also a big   place for Zscaler wins is by doing networking that they say   salespeople money?  Nir Zuk    --   Chief Technology Offcer  Yeah. Doing networking with a proxy, that's interesting,   but...  Lee Klarich    --   Chief Product Officer  He doesn't need anymore encouragement.  Michael Turits    --   Raymond James -- Analyst  I just want to get him proud -- I have seen him perform for a   while.  Nir Zuk    --   Chief Technology Offcer  Yeah. So SD-WAN, SD-WAN -- so maybe 30 seconds on what SD-WAN   is. So, just a word on same page. As applications move to the   cloud and it stops making sense to the MPLS, you want to -- you   start using regular Internet connection through IDSL, cable   modems, whatever, D3s, E3s, whatever you can get. The challenge   with that is that, they don't provide you the same reliability   and performance guarantees that MPLS does. So, all of the sudden,   you start relying on applications in the cloud like Office 365   and G Suite and Salesforce.com or your own applications in public   cloud, but you cannot get the same guarantees. So SD-WAN is about   taking multiple Internet connections like a DSL from one provider   and a cable modem from another or 2DSL or a DSL and LTE or 5G, so   on and so on, and somehow doing some kind of networking tricks on   them such that with the tool or more links you can get to the   same reliability and the same guarantees more or less that you   get from MPLS, of course, at a much lower cost, much higher   bandwidth, which is what those applications in the cloud   need. Now, there are multiple ways of doing that, you can do it in   the branch itself, meaning you can take the firewall that is in   the branch and you can add SD-WAN to that firewall and do that --   those networking tricks to make those multiple Internet   connections appear much more reliable. And we're doing that,   meaning we are building that and that's going to become a   subscription on top of the firewall, that's like Lee said, where   if you deploy our firewalls in the branch, we do that and in that   respect, it's somewhat similar to what other SD-WAN vendors are   doing, of course, with a differentiation being much better   security. Right? We always weigh in on security. The other option to do it -- and which we do today as well   with SD-WAN partners and we'll continue to do is to use SD-WAN to   bring the traffic to Prisma Access. Prisma Access, which is a   bunch of firewall deployed in the cloud, need the traffic   together. Now, you can do it with traditional IT sector or   something like that, a much more efficient way to do it is with   SD-WAN. So your program your SD-WAN your software-defined WAN to   bring the traffic to Prisma Access and then you do all the   security work in Prisma Access. The advantage of that is that you   don't have to deploy a new security box in the branch every few   years, because technology goes fail and you need to upgrade,   which is kind of like painting the Golden Gate Bridge, right? You   start, you deploy 2,000 branches, by the time you finish the   2,000, you have to start from the beginning, with Prisma Access   you don't have to do it and that's what the real differentiation   is. So doing SD-WAN in the cloud rather than doing SD-WAN in the   branch and using SD-WAN just to bring the traffic to the cloud is   the right way to do SD-WAN but for that you need to have   something like Prisma Access, and you need to have a networking   Prisma Access, not something that breaks the TCP connections and   restarts them, which is not networking based. It's called a   proxy.  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  QED, yes.  Nir Zuk    --   Chief Technology Offcer  Do I need to acquire? No like Lee said, we're building   SD-WAN.  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Okay.  Erik Suppiger    --   JMP Securities -- Analyst  Erik Suppiger, JMP. Couple of questions, one on the free cash   flow margins. Is the primary cause for the decline this year   duration or what should we think of as the primary hit on the   margin front? I'll ask the second question after that.  Kathy Bonanno    --   Chief Financial Officer  Yeah. The primary reason for the decline is the same primary   reason you see for our operating margin decline, and that's the   investments that we're making, not only organically to drive the   new areas of our business, but also the M&A investments that   we've made.  Erik Suppiger    --   JMP Securities -- Analyst  Okay. And then for...  Kathy Bonanno    --   Chief Financial Officer  Which is why we expect it to turn around.  Erik Suppiger    --   JMP Securities -- Analyst  Okay. Then for Nir or Lee, XDR, is that product   production-ready? How much of that -- how can we gauge the   success of XDR from here? Because we've had Traps out there for a   while. Is this something that's going to be a viable competitor   to CrowdStrike at this point? Or how should we be thinking about   that? And how much of that is getting sold outside of your   installed base?  Lee Klarich    --   Chief Product Officer  So, as we mentioned earlier, we're actually very happy with   how XDR has done. Now, it's early. We announced it about -- and   released about four and a half, five months ago. You saw the   results for the first full quarter, number of customers we added.   So, very excited about the initial market reception, customer   reception to XDR. And the messages that we talked about here are   things we're hearing from our customers. Very powerful -- the   ability to integrate the -- and stitch the endpoint data with the   network data. No one else can do that, no one else can give the   end-to-end visibility, reducing the number of alerts, reducing   the amount of time it takes them to actually investigate   incidents. So all the things we said here are -- they're here   because that's what we're hearing from our customers that have   adopted XDR. Okay? The -- and the interesting aspect of this is, that is enabling   us to really sort of change the conversation with our customers   to one that is a very strategic conversation about the shift   toward, not just endpoint protection, but the shift toward   analytics and ultimately toward automation and tying that with   Demisto. Okay?  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  So going back to the theory --  Nir Zuk    --   Chief Technology Offcer  Proxy, almost similar. No. This is another case where I think   that the right technical solution will win. EDR doesn't make any   sense. It really doesn't make any technical sense to limit   yourself to collecting data just from endpoints, limiting   yourself to processing data just from endpoints and then   responding back to the endpoints, where we all know that the   Traps happen across the entire infrastructure. They can start in   the SaaS application and then take over an endpoint and then   propagate through the network and end up in the public cloud,   where your data is. It -- the right technical way of doing it is to collect data   from multiple parts of the infrastructure into one place, use   your analytics, all your people or whatever it is to go through   the entire data, find the attacks-based information in the entire   data and when you find an attack, it doesn't matter where the   signal came from, you want to respond back to the entire   infrastructure, which is kind of where Demisto comes in,   responding back to the entire infrastructure. And I just don't   see the competition doing that. I don't see the competition doing   more than just basic endpoint data collection and response. So, assuming we get the right marketing and the right sales   and marketing around it, go-to-market and there are some missing   product features, I think that next time we'll be able to talk   much more about where we are versus the competition.  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  If I may elaborate on that from a market activity perspective,   and given that we've only had 4.5 months worth of great   experience with the product in the market against the competitor   you mentioned, we -- remember 12 months ago, we didn't have a   dedicated sales force that could compete in terms of on a   point-by-point basis against some of these competitors because we   had a core sales team, which was aren't as fully adaptive selling   this product. Now that we have speedboat teams out there, it's fair to say,   we saw CrowdStrike in between 25 and 30 deals, which were in our   installed base, because that's why we went after first, and I   think the number is we were able to beat them in 75% of the deals   we saw them in our installed base. Again, it's one data point.   But we're slowly getting our act together and getting better at   this stuff. But six months ago, we didn't have a product. Traps   would not compete against EDR because Traps endpoint protection   did not do an XDR. We launched XDR, we've made Traps free. We   have thousands of customers using Traps. Our first target is go   to the customers who already have Traps, they already have a   Firewalls, who better than them to make sure that they can buy an   XDR and we're delighted that 75% of them were CrowdStrike   [Indecipherable] more deals than we do because they have a larger   sales force, but we're delighted that we were able to beat in 25%   -- 75% of those deals.  Shaul Eyal    --   Oppenheimer & Co. -- Analyst  Thank you. Shaul from Oppenheimer again. Maybe question for   Amit or Kathy. European performance were as -- it has been quite   stable over the course of the past probably two years now. I   think this quarter and last quarter, not as strong as we have   seen before. So, is it a macro issue? Maybe a UK-specific issue?   Maybe tightening -- tying it to a former macro related question   that was asked? Thank your.  Amit Singh    --   President  It's just a great opportunity. Really -- it really is. Europe   strong adopter of -- cybersecurity is actually on the headlines   and there is national legislation in countries to go fix it. And   we're just investing in the team, giving them resources, we love   the leadership team there. So it's actually a growth opportunity   for us to do -- continue to do well and actually do better in   EMEA.  David Niederman    --   Vice President of Investor Relations  All right. We got one in the front and then two in the back on   the right.  Andrew Nowinski    --   Piper Jaffray -- Analyst  Thanks. Andy Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. So, the question   with regard to Prisma Access. At the Gartner Security Conference,   a few months ago Zscaler was on stage at the keynote and they had   a few customers on stage as well, that said, they tried your   GlobalProtect cloud service, which you're now calling Prisma   Access and didn't get the performance that they were looking for.   It wasn't scalable. I guess, can you just talk about how you've   changed or fixed the performance in the architecture?  Lee Klarich    --   Chief Product Officer  We -- it was a company, it was not existing customer. And they   had actually selected said competitor. So we had an opportunity   to get in one last chance and they told us the same thing. And we   said, can you share with us the test that you're doing? And it   was provided by the competitor and it was a flawed test. We were   able to show them how it was a flawed test and after they readed   the test to no longer be a flawed test, Prisma Access performed   wonderfully. So -- and that was before. The most recent update to   Prisma Access where we now have over 100 on-boarding locations   around the world. So, we are very pleased with the performance of   -- performance capabilities of Prisma Access as a globally   deployed cloud solution.  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  And as the video you saw, which talks about a million   employees and hundreds of hospitals, they ran a full POC against   the same competitors. So hopefully --. Sorry, which is already   deployed. Yes. All right. Question in the back and we're coming to the end of   our Q&A session. But we will take a few more questions some   there and then, let's go to Brad first. I don't want to end on   Brad.  Brad Zelnick    --   Credit Suisse -- Analyst  Thank you very much, Nikesh, I really appreciate it.  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  I want to go out happy. Okay?  Brad Zelnick    --   Credit Suisse -- Analyst  This is a fantastic presentation today. My question is   actually really simple. Three months ago, if we listen to your   remarks in your       earnings call    , you talked about a transition.  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Yeah.  Brad Zelnick    --   Credit Suisse -- Analyst  There is not much of a transition.  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Yes.  Brad Zelnick    --   Credit Suisse -- Analyst  Why?  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Good question. I'm glad you asked it. Four, five months ago we   were going full speed ahead analyzing every which way we can make   this transition to a fully ratable model. And when we sat down   and looked at it from an accounting perspective, a legal   perspective, a go-to-market perspective, we would have to impact   the channel, our salespeople, we all step back and said, OK, why   are we doing this. Our customers are buying billions of dollars   of products from us. They have a motion. Our salespeople know how   to record it. How to sell it. And we sat down and said, we're   doing it because the industry likes our models, our software   models. I personally like money upfront. Cash flow is a good   thing. You go out and hunt, use some this year, rest of them you   put in a cold store and use it in year two, and year three. Why   do I have to go hunt every year if I'm going to go to analyze   model? So, we just felt that we were trying to unnaturally change the   Company's business model and transition to a place, which is more   akin to a pure software SaaS ARR-based model and we are -- it's   kind of a hybrid business. We have a firewall business very   strong, and we're building the next-generation security business,   which we believe is going to be very strong and some of the   characteristics of this we really like. We like the upfront cash,   we like the cash flow that this brings us. We like the fact that   it gives you long-term deferred revenue, which allows you to be   amortized. So we decided that we're better off going this way. So   this is why we're here. And then we were comfortable that we've   analyzed everything -- every Sunday. This Analyst Day has been in   the making for six months. Right? We've been trying to look at   what we want to come and tell you, what's important, what's not   important. As I said, I probably will never read as many research   notes that I've read in the last six months from all of you guys,   apologies to you, but I have a day job. But I did read most of   them, and I did read, but you guys have concerned about, and I   understand why you like those models. But if you got to run the   Company, you'll be the owner [Phonetic] of the Company and the   way the customers want us to deliver the product. So that's   why.  Srini Nandury    --   Summit Insights Group LLC -- Analyst  Srini Nandury, Summit Insights Group. Nikesh, recently VMware   acquired Carbon Black and...  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Who?  Srini Nandury    --   Summit Insights Group LLC -- Analyst  VMware.  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Which Company?  Srini Nandury    --   Summit Insights Group LLC -- Analyst  Okay. VMware.  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Yeah, yeah. I know VMware very well.  Srini Nandury    --   Summit Insights Group LLC -- Analyst  Acquired Carbon Black.  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Yes, Carbon Black, yes.  Srini Nandury    --   Summit Insights Group LLC -- Analyst  Okay. So the question is this, we are trying to make sense of   how the landscape is going to be evolving, It looks like VMware   is going to be acquiring more companies in this space and what   does this mean for the whole security landscape going   forward?  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  I can't comment on VMware strategy. There are lot of people   who believe security is important, right? And they're all   stepping up their acquisitions and security. And I think that's   probably accurate. You will see a lot more acquisition in this   space, because I don't think 2,500 vendors are going to survive.   One of the questions early gentlemen asked was buying behavior. I   firmly believe in the next five years, you will see more   consolidated single vendor buys than you will see multi-vendor   buys. 800 EBCs at Palo Alto Networks where customers show up and   I haven't seen a customer who's actually espouses desire that he   wants -- he or she wants multiple vendors to be able to secure   their environment. They're looking for a solution which   integrates across multiple solutions. So, if any company out there, whether it's VMware, or whether   it's Microsoft, whether it's Broadcom can actually take products   and integrate them. I think they're going to win. So, the   question is not acquiring, we can all acquire companies.   Acquisition is the easiest part. The question is, can you   actually integrate them? Do you actually get leverage from   integrating them into your platform? Acquiring a customer,   putting them in an ELA and making them free or being part of your   large, what is that, I hear that platform level. So there is a   new term you will hear soon in the security space from ELAs to   PLAs because people have disparate products security and   consulting and chips and you could put them into a PLA now, it   does not have to be an ELA anymore because it's more than an Es   to P. But those are interesting parts. I think the true need of   the customer is an integrated platform. So people can deliver   integrated platform more part of them. Again, as Nir just   articulated, you need firewalls and endpoint to be able to work   together to be able to do next-generation security, similarly you   need container serverless public cloud workloads to do it   together. And I will tell you, the anecdotal and I apologize if it   doesn't apply. When I worked at Google, one of the businesses we   started to go after was display advertising, it has nothing to do   with security. And Google had no horse in the race. They didn't   want a display property. Microsoft had one, Yahoo had one. And   they're both very good at selling their own display properties,   but they were not good at cross market selling because typically   they defaulted their own product. And my concern is when you start looking at cloud native   players, like AWS or Azure or GCP or VMware with their own sort   of hybrid solutions, you default to better integrations and   better alignment with your core product and you don't do as good   a job of across industry security solution, across industry   products. So, our hope is we'll be the platform of choice across   multiple platforms as opposed to platforms that integrate   security and trying to bundle it when you buy their platform. So, if I don't want to deploy VMware, would I be deploying   Carbon Black today? I would have. I may have. Tomorrow, I suspect   the integration is going to be stronger. I'm not sure which   strategy gets me more revenue, maybe gets me more revenue given   the scale but I think the long-term outcome is that, you want a   multi-platform solution, which is somewhat platform agnostic. So   it can actually make it work better for you across multiple cloud   platforms. All right. Last one or two questions. Wow, I want to make sure   you guys don't leave here with questions and answers. Go ahead.   Up front. I'm sure I read about it tomorrow or the next week,   like why didn't they ask the question guys.  Unidentified Participant  Excellent. Thank you guys for having this presentation and   really compelling product vision. And it's great to see a value   proposition that's not just -- like you got to be secure because   we're going to scare the crap out of you. But also we're going to   provide them...  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  We'll do that out in the field not here.  Unidentified Participant  So we're going to provide value like making it easier and more   effective to do the security or there is a dual-value proposition   that customers must see. I wanted to drill down into sort of the   firewall market overall. Nir presented a really good sort of   rationale why firewalling isn't going to go away. We're still   going to be doing firewalling. But it seems like where we're   going to be doing that firewalling is going to change. So, I   guess, the question I have is, should we expect kind of the   traditional firewalling done from an appliance at the edge of the   network. Is that part of the market going to be stable,   increasing, declining in the midst of a broader kind of   firewalling capability that still grows?  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  So, I'll give you some data point and then I'll have our   product leadership answer that. I went back and as part of   preparing for the Analyst Day, I looked at the enterprise IT   spend of the last seven years, right? Because it's typically the   end-of-life for most IT infrastructure between seven to 10   depending on what it is and where you buy it. There is   approximately $1 trillion, $1.2 trillion a year, that's been   spent on enterprise IT. The reason I go to track that is because   I think security is 3% to 8% of that number, right? In financial   services, the government goes to 8% because they're very security   conscious, others go to 3%. So if you think about it, there is approximately $12 trillion   to $15 trillion of plant out there in enterprises, which is IT   infrastructure plant. I just put a slide up there, which is a   Gartner slide or Goldman Sachs slide, I don't remember those,   Goldman Sachs, maybe it's from this morning, which talks about   the cloud disruption opportunity of $1 trillion in 2023, right?   So, either you're telling me that we're going to stop spending an   enterprise IT and the IT entire is going to go down and all we're   going to do is, we're spending in the cloud. Or are you telling   me, people are still going to spend $1 trillion to it, growing at   3% and a lot of that is still going to go to enterprise IT. So, I   suspect this transition is going to take longer than we think   that people are still going to be spending enterprise IT. Now,   not in the margin, it may be smaller number because people are   shifting to the cloud and what it doing is two things, one, it's   making people reevaluate as I'm going to make that shift to the   cloud, what do I want to buy that allows me that transition, and   that's why one of the large retail as we talked about, they're   going to the cloud. They don't want to just buy hardware   firewalls, they want to make sure they can get VM, so the cloud   instances they can get a cloud-delivered architecture to Prisma   Access. So the question is, we expect this transition to happen in the   next five to seven years, a lot of it. Do you have products that   satisfy the three use cases? So data center use case, the   transition use case to the cloud and then the new architecture   toward the cloud. So we think that's why the product strategy is   aligned toward this transition. We think that shift is going to   happen. It will happen on a customer-specific basis depending how   ready they are. It will happen on a industry basis. So shows us   on the moving parts, but we think firewalling is around for a   while for the people who are still investing in data centers. But I'll let my product colleagues elaborate on the...  Lee Klarich    --   Chief Product Officer  Sure. So from a product perspective, the firewalls get   deployed in lots of different places, they get deployed in the   datacenter, they get deployed at headquarter gateways, regional   sites, branch offices, and the -- some of those use cases are   more attractive to shift the form factor. So, for example,   applications moving to public cloud, the form factor toward would   be software for lots of different technical reasons that are   mostly sort of straightforward to understand why you want to do   that. For example, you can't shift a hardware device to Amazon   and ask them to deploy into your AWS account. You have to use   software form factors. As we talked about for branch offices, retail, mobile users,   there is a shift that we are driving with Prisma Access that we   believe is a very good shift, both in terms of the customer   outcome, as well as what they need and want to be able to   accomplish. But there is still -- as Nikesh was saying, this   investment in the enterprise infrastructure over the last   seven-plus years, there will continue to be a lot of investment   in that infrastructure has to be protected. So, particularly in   the larger central sites, regional sites and the world will be   hybrid for a long time, meaning datacenters there will still be a   lot of hardware that will need to be deployed against that. And one thing we didn't talk about today, but it is very   important is, in a lot of those places that I just mentioned, the   performance of hardware starts to become really important, right?   If you think about a large headquarters with 10 gig connectivity   growing, you want to do internal segmentation or do segment of   IoT devices and things like that, which that would be 100 gig,   some of the larger datacenters, hardware still has a very   important role to play in a lot of those core use cases.  Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  All right. I think with that we'll call an end to the Q&A   session. I want to say thank you to my management team here, who   has been part of the journey and getting us here so far. I also   want to use the opportunity to shout at our 7,000 employees   around the world who worked hard to deliver the results that we   are able to deliver and hopefully we'll keep working hard for the   next three years to achieve the targets and beyond, to achieve   the targets we've outlined. With that, it's my pleasure to invite you downstairs for some   cocktails and some demos, instead -- in case you want to geek out   in some of the products.

    " David Niederman    --   Vice President of Investor Relations ",
    "Hello. Thanks for coming, we really appreciate it. Good   afternoon, I am David Niederman Vice President of Investor   Relations at Palo Alto Networks. Thanks for joining us today to   discuss our Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2019 Results.   This meeting is being broadcast live over the web and can be   accessed on our Investor Relations section of our website at   investors.paloaltonetworks.com.",
    "Earlier this afternoon, we issued a press release announcing   our results for our fiscal fourth quarter and full year ended   July 31, 2019. We also provided a script of certain fiscal fourth   quarter and full-year 2019 financial results and operating   metrics along with applicable reconciliations as exhibits to a   curren   t report    on Form 8-K filed with the SEC earlier this afternoon. Copies of   these materials can also be found on the Investors section of our   website.",
    "I'd like to remind you that management will be making   forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our   near and long-term financial guidance and strategy as well as   modeling points for Q1'20 and full year fiscal 2020. Please   kindly take a moment to review the Safe Harbor language provided   with the meeting materials, also please note that certain   financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a   non-GAAP basis, and have been adjusted to exclude certain   charges.",
    "For historical periods, we provided reconciliations of these   non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in the   supplemental financial information that can be found at the end   of the presentation and the investor section of our website   located at investors.paloaltonetworks.com. On stage with us today   will be Nikesh Arora, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer;   Kathy Bonanno, our Chief Financial Officer; Lee Klarich, our   Chief Product Officer; and Nir Zuk, our Chief Technology Officer.   We will have a Q&A forum at the end of the financial   presentation.",
    "And with that, I'll turn it over to Kathy.",
    " Kathy Bonanno    --   Chief Financial Officer ",
    "Hi everyone, thank you so much for coming today, I look a   smattering of applause how nice, I appreciate that. Thank you.   Thank you all very, very much for coming today, we appreciate   your interest in Palo Alto Networks. We have a lot to cover   today, and so I'm just going to get right into it. I'm going to   start by providing a quick overview of our fiscal Q4 results for   the fiscal year 2019 and full year results. Nikesh will then come   up and he'll walk you through our strategy and our operating   framework for the next three years, and then Lee Klarich and Nir   Zuk will take you through our product strategy and I'll return to   cover forward-looking guidance at the end.",
    "So let's turn now to fiscal fourth quarter 2019 which   capped-off another great year for Palo Alto Networks. In the   quarter, we grew revenue 22% year-over-year to approximately $806   million. Quarterly billings crossed the billion-dollar mark, a   first in the Company's history. And our performance in Prisma and   Cortex or as we refer to them collectively as next-gen security   was especially strong. Our next-gen security billings were   approximately $192 million in the quarter, this represents a $768   million annual run-rate to approximately -- and accelerated our   growth to approximately 180% year-over-year. For the full fiscal   year, we also delivered strong top line results and full-year   free cash flow was approximately $924 million. If we adjust for   the cash charges associated with our headquarters in Santa Clara   and the retirement of our 2019 convertible debt free cash flow   for the year was $1.1 billion at a margin of 36.7%.",
    "So let's turn now to some of the product highlights for the   quarter. In Q4, we completed the acquisitions of Twistlock and   PureSec, and we are actively integrating them into our Prisma   cloud offering. We also released significant updates to Prisma   access including providing over 100 network on-boarding locations   around the globe and providing clean pipe for service providers,   along with several other unique capabilities in that release. In   addition, we released Traps 6.1, which included expanded support   for Mac OS and Linux, further strengthening our endpoint and XDR   offerings.",
    "And we received FedRAMP certification for WildFire cloud, a   huge milestone toward shifting government wildfire usage toward   the cloud. And as you probably just saw earlier this afternoon,   we announced our intent to acquire Zingbox, an enterprise IoT   security company. As Nikesh will discuss a bit later, this   acquisition if you had another example of our ongoing strategy to   consolidate new technologies into our next generation firewall   platform, making it easier for customers to protect their complex   enterprise environment. In addition to product releases, we had   several notable wins during the quarter. We displaced Symantec   and Zscaler at a Fortune 50 U.S. retailer to secure their data   center and network of more than 2000 retail outlets.",
    "We displaced Zscaler and the Fortinet at a major European   national healthcare provider in their digital transformation   project. They're securing their hundreds of hospitals, along with   all of their patients and employees. It was a great win for us in   the quarter. VP, CrowdStrike and displaced Symantec with our   Prisma and Cortex platforms at a global insurance company with   more than 25 million policyholders and we bid Fortinet and   display Cisco to become the standard security platform for the   government of one of the most populist regions in Asia   Pacific.",
    "In summary, there was a lot of great news in the quarter. We   continue to have high win rates against our competition and add   thousands of new customers every quarter. In Q4, we added nearly   3,000 new customers and are now privileged to have won nearly   65,000 customers. We're looking forward to another great year in   fiscal 2020, and we'll now move on to the rest of the   presentation.",
    "Please welcome, our CEO, Nikesh Arora.",
    " Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ",
    "Good afternoon. Thank you very much for joining us, and thank   you, Kathy. Normally when I get up on stage, I usually ask the   audience, what can I answer that you leave your happy. Now many   of you are so kind, you've written me very long notes about what   do you want me to tell you, which we're going to make you happy.   It's very helpful. Just like I have my marching orders you've   given me the script. So Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley, yes, we   will talk about product evolution M&A. Keith Bachman talks   about depth and duration of depressed cash flow stands very   depressing, but we'll talk about that they're not depressed.",
    "We will go down to the details of our next generation security   business and explain the financial models around you, they don't   get spooked by duration issues. And yes, Brad, no hardware   company of this size have made a transition like this, but   hopefully we just need to keep growing and not make the   transition.",
    "You do notice that we're displacing your favorite company   Zscaler and many situations. So, but I'm scared today, we had   changes or recommendations, something is going to happen to the   rest of you guys. So for now, and I'm happy with Brad where he   is? So it's about 12 plus months, I've been at Palo Alto Networks   and I know you guys have been asking for us to come about and   explain how we're thinking about this Company going forward. So,   hopefully in the next 75-80 minutes me, Nir, Lee and many of my   management colleagues will share our plan for the next three   years with you, in terms of where we want to take this   Company.",
    "Before I go there, I thought I would do is quickly walk you   through what I've learned over the last 12 months. Now   unfortunately there is going to be no earth-shattering secrets.   And what I'm going to tell you in the first section -- but   hopefully, you'll get a sense that I mean studying this industry   for a while and the problems are obvious, right this is $140   billion industry, and we have too many vendors. I've gone to over   300 customers in the last one year. The winner so far is 212   cyber security vendors deployed under one customer. That's a lot.   What that happens is when you have 212 cybersecurity vendors and   cybersecurity is only 8% to 10% of your spend, it's way too many   vendors for the amount of spend you do on IT compared to the rest   of the vendors we have.",
    "What that results in, is people are deploying too many tools,   one of these customers, not the 212 vendor customer has nine   endpoints deployed. We have nine CRM systems, we've nine HR   systems, we have nine endpoints in one financial services   organization. We think that model is broken, it's wrong, it   cannot be the part of securing that enterprise for the future. If   you think what we do in the industry is we give you the tools,   and say now, you can write policy against it, you can spin-up a   bunch of alerts and we'll give you all the dealers and you can   figure out what to do with them.",
    "So we have tremendous amounts of alerts being generated in   many of our customers and Lee and Nir will talk more about this.   On average a customer can get 175,000 alerts a week, it's a lot   of alerts. And then you spent a lot of time and effort manually   going through your issues in investigating which can take   anywhere from 4 to 57 days. We have an industry where we have too   many vendors, too many tools, too many alerts, and too much   manual labor. We think at the same time all are busy complicating   the industry. Our friends -- the adversaries have gotten more and   more sophisticated. The days of malicious software, the days of   key loggers are gone. Now we're talking about AI based bots, ML   based attacks and people are really addressing your entire   enterprise infrastructure, trying to figure out how to get   it.",
    "The amount of breaches have actually gone up. Last year is   about 3,800 breaches and mostly the breaches were automated   attacks. So it's got an interesting situation in the industry. We   have a situation where people are spending more and more money on   cybersecurity and they're feeling less secure. This is a problem.   This problem needs to be fixed. So we believe we need a new   paradigm for security and much of what we're going to talk about   is what that new paradigm is going to be or needs to be. We   believe we need to go toward lesser number of vendors. We believe   you need to go toward more comprehensive security. We believe   this has to be more of an automated industry as opposed to an   industry that is full of -- lot of manual labor. So a lot of what   Lee and Nir are going to talk about is going to be how our   products are going to enable that going forward and we will talk   specifically about some of the things we're working on which will   be unveiled over the course of next few quarters and years, and   how we intend to make this happen.",
    "At the same time we are at an inflection point in the   industry, in my travels over the last 12 months, and my time at   Google, I have met a customer who is not thinking about going to   the cloud. Almost every customer I met, approximately 10   [Phonetic] of them is in some way, shape or form on their journey   to the cloud, some of them are evaluating the cloud, some of them   are sort of deploy some application in the cloud, some of them   are in a hybrid cloud environments -- going to go to multiple   clouds, but there is not a customer who is not talking about the   cloud.",
    "Interestingly, we don't believe that cloud security has   matured as fast as the cloud platforms have. So the best   security, you can get us some cloud data security offered by an   individual platform provider, but we actually don't have   comprehensive cloud security that allows you to make that journey   to the cloud in a more comfortable and happy fashion. So our   belief is, as we see this cloud market go to potentially $1   trillion over the next five years, there is a huge opportunity   for cloud security to play a relevant role in allowing these   customers to make their cloud journey over the next three to five   years. It's a big opportunity and the big opportunity we have   here is to make sure we don't make the same mistakes we've made   in enterprise security. We need to get cloud security, right.",
    "We anticipate in cloud security, there is an opportunity for   us to become a platform of choice and customers not have to deal   with the problem of too many tools, too many vendors, too many   alerts and too much manual labor. I won't talk more about that   when Lee and Nir come and talk about what we've been doing in the   last 12 months for cloud security. So before I walk, before I   have them come up on stage and talk about the opportunity ahead   of us, I want to make sure I give you a sense of what we're doing   for the last 12 months and you guys have been writing all these   notes, I'm trying to figure out what we love to, as a company.   Let's take a look at where we've come from. 12 months ago when I   came to Palo Alto Networks, we had a phenomenal Company, the   Company that has built an amazing firewall had a great brand,   tremendous amounts of trust with our customers in all 50,000   customers in the market.",
    "There is a lag between when click this when this slide shows   up. This is Palo Alto Networks. We were -- are primarily a   firewall company. We've made a few acquisitions and we had done a   bunch of projects in the side. But despite the way we had   implemented and we have managed to get 8% [Phonetic] of our   billings from not at our services outside of our firewall   business. The worrying thing was though, I noticed we would   acquire companies and decouple them and merge them into our   hardware-based business. So that's a bad thing if you start   taking the software businesses and start making the workload   hardware businesses. Hardware has a certain [Indecipherable],   cycle has certain deployment cycle, software as a slightly   different cycle. It's very important for us to make sure we were   going to get this right.",
    "We spent the last 12 months, focusing. Now I may not know   enough about cybersecurity, but having spent as many of you know   I spent 10 years at Google, the one thing I did learn at Google   is the first and foremost, you have to get your product strategy   right. So poor Lee Klarich, our Head of Product; Nir, our CTO,   and many of our product colleagues has spent many a nice sitting   with me, writing and rewriting product plans, looking at   competition, looking at our strategy, looking at whether we are   set up to win or not. And literally rearchitecting many of our   products and our strategy is to make -- we set ourselves up to   win. Please spend -- ours there are written documents and   probably on their 15th the durations, we went through every   product categories in that, why do you make this acquisition?   What is the way to win in this category? How are you going to --   when do we have enough resource to deploy it against that? And   once we get the product right, do we have the go-to-market   capability, to go make this happen in the market.",
    "It wasn't simple. It wasn't easy, but some of it is also very   exciting. In our firewall business, we had been selling   subscriptions, four subscriptions against our firewalls. I mean,   sat and talk about why cannot the firewall become a platform? Why   cannot we take or we have the firewall and instead of having 20   different network appliances in a customer's infrastructure like   on our firewall become the platform of the future for enterprise   security.",
    "So as Lee and Nir will talk about, we are going to go from   four to potentially 10, maybe more subscriptions over time,   because we believe once our customers trust us to be part of   their enterprise infrastructure, we have the ability to go and   deploy more and more capability into that infrastructure. And we   will talk about our latest acquisition of Zingbox, the whole   intent is to make that another subscription on firewall. We   believe our customers will deploy that firewall, just the way,   they've deployed DNS security, which we launched a few months   ago. So on our firewall side, we have built, we have continued to   build the next generation firewall into a faster, better   firewall. But really when we went back to the drawing board we   sat back and said, Nir if you were starting a company and   building firewalls so that we wanted to. Although some of you   believe the firewalls are not going to be interesting. We'll talk   about why they're going to continue to be interesting. We sat   down and thought, how would you rearchitect the firewall business   and how do you build it going forward. So what you will see as   part of our enterprise strategy firewalls is our expectations of   how this market is going to evolve and how do we need to be in   the top right of that Magic Quadrant continue to go further in   that direction as opposed to not continue the innovation.",
    "Not only that, on our cloud front, we had one acquisition   called Evident, we've made 12 months ago. Over the last 12   months, we've examined the cloud security space very, very   carefully. We believe there needs to be a comprehensive   multi-cloud, multi-technology platform available for cloud   security. We have made two acquisitions in that space with   Twistlock and PureSec and we hope to be able to integrate them   very swiftly, hopefully before the end of this calendar year and   be able to provide the best cloud security platform to our   customers.",
    "Prisma cloud, I'm not confusing this would VMs or any other   product, has over 1,000 customers already. We do not believe   there is any cloud security company in the world today with over   1,000 customers securing the public cloud, none. And we've been   able to achieve that over the last 12 months. Not only that, we   looked at our products called GPCS, which is effectively Prisma   access, which is, I shouldn't talk about competition just yet. So   it's a product with real security that helps you secure cloud   native architectures, unlike some of the things in the market. I   think is a popular -- today's Lexicon. So we took Prisma access,   we resource that we moved to Google Cloud we on-boarded 200 plus   locations and you saw the results. We had the biggest quarter   over Prisma access in Q4 than we ever had in the Company. We have   our first over $10 million deal for Prisma access where as we   highlighted we've displaced Zscaler. So feel very confident in   our ability to keep building Prisma access as one of the future   architecture for securing the cloud.",
    "On securing the future, we looked hard at the SOC industry.   And Lee and Nir will talk about it. We weren't comfortable with   the way the industry is going. We're not comfortable where the   solution needs to be that you take all the data, put it in a very   large data repository, run a bunch of analytics against and   spin-up more alerts. These alerts get them to the SOCs analyst   thing that you had 174,000, I've got another 100 really good   alerts for you take a look at. That's not the right answer.",
    "We looked at the market, we acquired Demisto, Demisto has done   really well for us, and we believe the future of SOCs is going to   be more toward automation and Lee and Nir will talk about more   about what we're able to do in that space. We also took what was   our [Indecipherable] acquisition and our like severance IVR   acquisitions and looked heart of the EDR space and said, where is   the endpoint industry going to evolve to, how are we're going to   win.",
    "We launched XDR four months ago, we've had our first full   quarter of XDR and we're delighted with the fact that 250   customers have already been acquired by the XDR team. Now this   wasn't done without our ability to run, not just the product   focus, but also a focus in our go-to-market capability. Over the   last 12 months, we have taken our Prisma and Cortex teams from   500 people 1,500 people. We did that by hiring new people and   acquisitions and effectively redeploying resources from what   would have been part of our core business into our new business,   which is what has allowed us to accelerate our Prisma and Cortex   growth rate from approximately 70% odd to 180% as Kathy   highlighted. But we feel very confident that is a number or set   of numbers we can really focus on and drive further and we'll   talk more about where we expect those numbers to go over the next   three years.",
    "So what does it, was it look like today? We've been able to   grow our billings from our next generation security services to   $452 million, approximately 13% of our total billings in FY'19.   And we feel very, very confident that we have our product   portfolio cleared up and we believe we are actually in the   process of delivering and deploying three different platforms in   the market, one around our firewall, one around our cloud   security and one around securing the future where both the   firewalls and our cloud security capabilities come together in   the slot. We believe our opportunity in the enterprise is to be   able to simplify enterprise security and reduce the number of   vendors, and that alliance our customers have with vendors. And   it's fascinating as Kathy highlighted one of our very large   retail customers we acquired in Q4 has gone to a single vendor   solution.",
    "A single vendor across all forms of firewalls, firewalls and   the data center, virtual firewall against our cloud instances and   Prisma access against their network security needs. So we are   noticing customers rearchitecting the security as I think about   going to the cloud, that rethinking to the need multiple vendors   to secure them across these various form factors across these   various technologies and many of the smarter ones of course I'm   going to say that are making the choice toward consolidating into   a single vendor platform. Not only that, on the cloud front we've   had customers off we acquired Twistlock and RedLock, who are in   evaluation mode have signed multi-million dollar multi-year deals   with us, because now they believe where Twistlock and RedLock and   PureSec with Palo Alto Networks, we are going to keep building   and investing in these products and continue to grow them further   and they're delighted with our vision in terms of how we plan to   deliver cloud security to them.",
    "We believe we have an opportunity to keep being ahead of the   curve of cloud security and it was funny. When we acquired   RedLock, the RedLock team kind of means that we're going to go,   build continues security for you. That just sounds wonderful. I   came to New York and I went to about 10 to 15 customers in the   financial services and said, look you're using our Prisma cloud   security, we're going to build the container security in nine   months. So like, we don't have time. We're going to take what's   out there, the best of you continue to secure, we're going to use   it. It's interesting, our customers want best of breed, but they   don't want to wait for integrated platform to appear and be   available across multiple technologies. So we have been able to   take RedLock and Twistlock and PureSec and put them together and   offer best-of-breed across container serverless and public cloud   to our customers as a platform.",
    "We believe our opportunity is to stay ahead in that space and   deliver comprehensive multi-cloud, multi-platform integrated   security solution for a cloud. Last but not the least, in the   future, we believe we have the opportunity of taking good data as   opposed to all data. Taking that and applying analytics to it and   being able to provide tremendous amounts of automation to allow   our customers to be able to secure the future. So I had an option   of standing up here and regaling you with my product capability   and my product knowledge, but I figured one of the highlights of   today, it could be for you guys to hear from our Founder, who is   promised to give you an unfiltered version of what he thinks   about the industry and how things need to go from there.",
    "And then we'll have Lee [Indecipherable] and moderate him to   make sure he doesn't go off the rails. But before I invite them,   I'm delighted to say, last time, we had an Analyst Day, we   pointed you to a Palo Alto Networks stands at about $19 billion.   We believe with all the product investment and product capability   have developed, we now have the opportunity of addressing those,   close to 70 people in dollar term in FY '22. The magic of FY '22   is you will notice when I come back after Lee and Nir have talked   about our product investments, I'm going to give you guidance for   the next three years in terms of what we expect our billings to   be and what we expect our next generation security capabilities   to get to our cash flows and our operating margins. So hold your   breath, don't hold your breath, just hang in there.",
    "With that, let me welcome Lee and Nir up on stage.",
    " Lee Klarich    --   Chief Product Officer ",
    "Good afternoon.",
    " Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ",
    "Good afternoon.",
    " Lee Klarich    --   Chief Product Officer ",
    "I've been working with Nir for a very, very long time almost   10 years. And I think this is the first time that he and I are   actually sharing a stage together. So here we go, and that should   be fine. I guess there should be fine. So what we'd like to do a   share with you our product strategy and how we think about   things. And we will fit that into the contracts that Nikesh has   walked through in terms of the three pillars, securing the   enterprise, securing the cloud and securing the future.",
    "Now I've been in the security industry for a very long time.   I've been in Palo Alto Networks for very long time and I can't   definitively say that I've never been more excited and confident   in our ability to deliver these platforms in a very unique and   differentiated way.",
    "Now to kick us off, no better person than Nir to talk about   securing the enterprise. Nir?",
    " Nir Zuk    --   Chief Technology Offcer ",
    "Thank you, Lee. So let's talk a little bit about securing the   enterprise, specifically about network security. I know that some   of you would like to believe that the firewall is going away, and   there is no role for network security in the future. In reality,   there are things that have to be done through the network --   through network security and there is just not a place to do   them. And so things like looking for command and control   connections. Things like combining access control, user identity   and authorization systems. And most importantly, more than half   of the devices that enterprise use today cannot be protected by   running something on the device itself, have to be protected from   the network. Mobile phones, we've locked down operating systems   or limited battery life, routers, switches, printers,   network-attached scanners and all other kind of IoTs like IP   phones and things like that. The only way to protect them is   through the network because you can't run anything on it. So   network security is here to stay, it's always been the core of   cybersecurity and will continue to be the core of cybersecurity,   but changes have to be made, because over time applications have   been moving from the corporate data center into the cloud with   our SaaS or public cloud and users have been moving from   corporate networks into smaller offices, branch offices they have   been moving of the network completely in the form of being mobile   users and network security has to follow them and network   security has to follow them wherever they go because again there   are things that network security is the only thing or there   things that network security has to do, like so on cybersecurity   functionality, like access control and supporting again devices   that can only be done from the network.",
    "The challenge is how you do that, how do you follow the user   when they're off the network, how do you follow the application   when it's running in the public cloud, and more importantly, like   Nikesh said, customers are asking us to consolidate more and more   functionality that would deploy in the network separately from   the firewall into the single next generation based platform that   we have created. And to talk about that and the innovation around   it, we'll go back to Lee.",
    " Lee Klarich    --   Chief Product Officer ",
    "So there is lots of innovation is going on in next-gen   firewall. There is two areas in particular, I want to talk   through with all of you today that are -- of particular   importance. The first is sort of piggyback off when Nir was   talking about the importance of form factors, OK. How do we take   all the same capabilities and make sure that they can be deployed   everywhere, the in-line security as needed. And this is something   we started driving several years ago when we expanded from   hardware appliance form factors to software form factors with the   VM series. Since that time, VM series has turned into the leading   virtual next-gen firewall in the market. And then from there and   we're recently we expanded into delivering these capabilities as   a service with Prisma access, which allows us to extend security   out to mobile users branch offices, retail environment, et   cetera.",
    "Now with particularly powerful about this, in addition to be   able to provide consistent security everywhere, is the ability to   have a single control plane to be able to manage this   consistently as well. As Nikesh mentioned earlier, one of our   very large customer acquisitions in the previous quarter was a   customer who had been with us for a while with hardware and the   data center. And in the quarter as they extended that using   VM-series and Prisma access into a complete solution, and what   was particularly exciting and relevant to them was the ability to   get that consistent security consistent control plane, we can't   get anywhere else.",
    "Now, going hand in hand with us, is the ability to use of   firewall as a platform for delivering more and more capabilities.   If you look -- if you think about the enterprise security market,   it is actually insane. The number of different security vendors   that customers have to deal with is crazy. We have a running   tally of the most number of security vendors that customers deal   with when they come to our -- or you'd to be see hear about what   we can do for them. I think the latest record is now up well   above 200 different security vendors for a single customer. They   have to deal with and manage.",
    "Now we have been, from the very beginning, starting   consolidate these through integrating best-in-class capabilities   into our next-gen firewall. We did this with IPS, we did this   with filtering and we really substantially change those markets.   We took a bit of a hiatus but we're back. The DNS security   launched earlier this year, our fifth subscription for the   next-gen firewall and we intend to extend this more rapidly going   forward to be able to integrate, what would otherwise be   stand-alone capabilities and be able to consolidate those into   our firewall platform. Importantly to do that across all form   factors as well.",
    "Now, you saw the announcement earlier today, our Zingbox for   IoT security, I'll talk about that a little bit more detail in a   second. But just to give you some flavor for the security   services, we're looking at. We're also actively working on and   building SD-WAN, as an example, that we will be able to integrate   across the different form factors, in order to be able to again   both simplify as well as provide better capabilities to our   customers across their network environments.",
    "Now, to talk about IoT the, this is becoming a very much a   growing issue within the enterprise, as you can see from some of   the things here, even fish tanks can be used to break into   enterprises and move laterally. Hackers are using IoT devices as   both initial insertion points as well as the ability to move   laterally across networks. Now, why is this? IoT devices are --   have become very ubiquitous across the enterprise. By our   estimation what we've observed in both our own environment as   well as others for every employee, there is about three different   IoT devices in the typical enterprise. In many cases IoT devices   they're unpatched, they're unmanaged, they're connected by   definition, there is a security risk. I believe that every single   one of our 65,000 customers hasn't growing IoT security needs.   And we will be unique in being able to deliver that as an   integrated service to our next-gen firewall, obviating the need   to deploy yet more hardware, in order to get a very relevant and   important new security service.",
    "Without us the options are looking at a handful of small   vendors and trying to figure out which one to invest in and which   one you're going to take the operational burden of trying to   deploy throughout your network. That's a very powerful approach   that we are able to take by delivering necessary integrated   service. And so with that combination of the evolving and   expanding form factors, the ability to then deploy multiple and   additional security services to those form factors, we see a   great opportunity to address the network security TAM, as well as   an opportunity to replace what today is often outsourced manual   labor with product and automation. You'll see that theme as we   talk about the different areas. This ability to look to leverage   automation to replace outsource manual labor is one of the large   opportunities we have in consolidating the products around   us.",
    "So switching gears from enterprise to the cloud. Okay, now,   when we talk about cloud, we're going to talk about two distinct   aspects of the cloud. The first, just about every enterprise is   on some journey of moving some of their applications to the   cloud. Typically, multi-cloud they're often still keeping the   data -- part of the data center for some of the applications. So   it's hybrid that is one opportunity, very significant   opportunities you saw before. The second is to leverage the cloud   to deliver security to the end users, those are mobile branch   office, et cetera. So let's start with securing the cloud.",
    "Now a concept that all of you have seen, probably a million   times. But just an important concept is a shared responsibility   model. Customers are responsible for the security of everything   they deploy in the cloud. And as we've seen many of these   applications that we deploy are mission critical, have incredibly   sensitive data and they need the best security solution across   multi-cloud and hybrid cloud. Now to put this in context, the   world has moved beyond lift and shift to large extent and we'll   continue to move toward more cloud native application   architectures, which will require a cloud first approach to   security. You cannot simply take on-prem data center capabilities   and simply move them, you have to take into approach.",
    "What you're seeing here is a typical application that is   multiple different components, which is very standard. Each of   those components often running in a different technology stack.   So how do you secure an application like that? All right, so it   requires a lot of the same security functions wherever the   application is, but those security functions have to then be   applied across all the different technology stacks. For example,   you need to vulnerability management of course and you need to   apply that to VM's. The typical industry answer to this would be   say, that's a product. The problem is you're going to get to   that. Every line representing a different product. Now if you're   an enterprise looking at that, -- that's a lot. We are at risk of   repeating the sense of the past, if we let that happen.",
    "I firmly believe the Palo Alto Networks is the only Company in   a position, and with the focus of preventing that from happening.   With Prisma cloud, our intention and what we are delivering to   our customers is the most comprehensive cloud security platform   that they can get. Taking these different capabilities, applying   them across the different technology stacks, multi-cloud and even   hybrid cloud to help secure our customers journey to the cloud.   And to be clear, there is a lot that is yet to be done. I   anticipate that there are a number of cloud security technologies   that haven't been invented yet, but we will have to be thinking   about. And we will continue to be very decisive and purposeful   about building out this platform and continue to maintain its   position as the most comprehensive solution.",
    "Now to talk about the other kind of cloud and for that   Nir.",
    " Nir Zuk    --   Chief Technology Offcer ",
    "Thank you, Lee. Maybe before that I'm very excited about   Prisma Cloud. When we started the company and Lee has been with   me, since the beginning. When we started the company, we are   going to build an acceleration firewall and we had a bunch of   very large vendors that we have to go and displace which we've   done. But we're today by far the largest network security vendor   out there. It was a lot of work displacing them. I think that   with cloud with public cloud security and generally with cloud   security the market is open. There is the need, I don't see any   other vendor in a position to do this. And I think that the   numbers that you've seen and the numbers that you will see speak   for themselves. Because to do this, you have to first have the   firewall because there is no way to secure the cloud without a   firewall, you have to look at the things that only the firewall   can look and there are things that's running in the cloud, that   you need a firewall, because you can't run endpoint security on   them.",
    "And then on top of that, you need all the different   technologies that we've been building and acquiring and   integrating over the last few years, that I just don't see anyone   out there that's even thinking about it nevertheless, someone   that has the different components that are required in order to   go after the cloud security market. So very excited about that,   at least as much as much as we're excited when we started Palo   Alto Networks and went after the enterprise security market. Now   once applications start moving to the cloud, which they are,   enterprise network architectures and access architectures are   changing. And the reason for that -- oops we are missing a slide   here.",
    "Sorry. Okay, yeah, so the reason for that is that   traditionally the way users have been accessing enterprise   applications, which were running in enterprise data centers was   through remote access solutions like GlobalProtect for example   and through MPLS, IPVPN MPLS links, and those links were offering   guaranteed bandwidth and guaranteed performance that they were   great way to access enterprise applications. Once applications   start moving to the cloud whether it's SaaS or public cloud and   once users are moving into smaller offices into branch offices   and of course, become mobile, it doesn't make sense anymore to   run all the traffic through the data center and then go out to   the Internet. You want to have direct Internet access from   wherever the user is, whether it's in the branch office or   whether the user is mobile.",
    "Of course with the tradition of the cybersecurity industry,   the way we're doing it or the way the industry is doing it is by   offering more and more and more solutions to try to do it, try --   we have mTLS and then side to side VPNs. And then some traffic   goes -- SaaS traffic has to go a CASB proxy, then we have a bunch   of CASB companies. And of course our favorite topic, the cloud   delivered security VI proxy. And maybe a side note here, and if I   have seem a little bit angry then maybe because it is I am,   because I feel like I'm playing a whack-a-mole game, because   about 24 years ago, I had to kill the first generation of proxies   with [Indecipherable] inspection. If you remember, companies like   Secure Computing anyone here cover them? You'll probably   responsible for them having a higher market cap than checkpoint   at the time.",
    "I'm not sure where they are today and companies like Raptor   and others, and of course proxy is always had the issues with   proxies, they are slow, they break applications, they break   networking, they break network optimization, network routing and   so on. So hard to kill them the first time. And then 12 years ago   in 2007, when we started selling our products here, we had to   kill the next generation of proxies, the Blue Coat and the   Websense's of the world, which again didn't make any sense.   Proxies have never made sense, they are slow, high latency, they   break applications, you can't run everything to them, they break   networking. And so on, which we have, we all know our Blue Coat   is today right part of Broadcom and I'm not sure Websense is. And   now it's measureful right, third time and other mole is popping,   we have to deliver security from the cloud, how we're going to do   it? Guess what, we're going to do it with a proxy.",
    "Now, why would you do it with a proxy and not with network   security, because it is easy, it's very difficult to become a   network security company, it's very difficult to build something   that can go into the infrastructure, whether it's physical or   virtual and provide the networking and security the pocket based   security at the application level. So vendors are taking the easy   way out, right, let's put a proxy, so we break applications, so   we break the network who cares, customers are going to pay for it   anyways, and they are trying to use proxies to solve the   issue.",
    "So first I think proxy is the wrong way to -- and I'm not   think, I'm sure proxies are boring. If I were here six months   ago, I would say we're going to kill the proxy after what you've   seen and what I've seen in the last two quarters, we have killed   the proxy. But again -- but I really think that it's not just a   proxy, it's this -- it's this mess that the industry suggesting   in order to fix the access challenges that are associated with   the move to the cloud. And of course there is a much better   solution, and that by better solution is what Prisma access is   about.",
    "The Prisma access takes mobile users, and it takes branch   offices in a single cloud delivered firewall -- through firewall   base our firewall-based solution, it provides access to SaaS   applications with our CASB, to public cloud applications to   on-premise applications and whatever comes next this platform is   going to do. And the reason this platform has been so successful   in the last couple of quarters and is going to continue to be so   successful is because when customers see this versus the mess   that today is called access, again a mess driven by the cloud,   the choice is very, very clear. This is the way to do it. And if   I look at our position in the market there are not many firewall   vendors out there. There are probably four firewall vendors that   sell today, the other three vendors are busy trying to figure out   why they can't sell hardware against our hardware. I just don't   see anyone else today in a position to go and capture this huge   access to the cloud market. I really like our position, I really   like where we are today and I certainly like where we are taking   it into -- in the future.",
    "Sorry, I'll continue. So now that we've covered. [Video   Presentation]",
    "Can you imagine trying to access X-ray data through a proxy,   they tried, and they have to throw out the huge deployment of   that proxy. So going back to TAM, we think that cloud security in   2020 represents a very large TAM, a very large opportunity. And   like I said, I personally just don't see much competition over   there and anyone that has the components to compete against us,   in cloud security. And then if you look at the automation that's   needed in order to drive that security automation that today is   done by people, and we do that with software and analytics, the   opportunity becomes even larger, OK.",
    "So now that we cover the first two pillars, let's move to   secure the future. So let me cash that, both enterprise security   and cloud security are here to stay with us for a long time. And   we have to do both and we have to be good at both and we are   going to be continuing doing both and be the market leaders in   both. At some point, these two converge in the security operation   system, because the security operation system needs to run both   enterprise security and cloud security and it all comes to one   place. And they are big issues in the security operations today   that just aren't that basically make this security persons that   are not prepared for the future. And we've decided a couple of   years ago to go and fix that to prepare the security operation   center for the future.",
    "So let's just talk about what's not working in the security   operation center. Most security operation centers are based   around a technology called SIEM, Security Incident and Event   Management, by the way -- nothing to do with incident and event   management, but whatever we'll call them that, that basically   collect as much log as they can from network devices and   endpoints and applications and servers and wherever they can get   logs from and then to have a bunch of static rules and or manual   labor looking at this data and guess what they do, they generate   alerts based on the data. Now of course, the data that's coming   in, already includes alerts, because if the firewall or the IPS   or whatever found something bad or something bad was found, bad   was found in the public cloud, and so on.",
    "On top of the alerts, that's the SIEM collects and displays   with the user, the SIEM has rules, we call them correlation rules   that generate even more alerts. Some theme have some filtering   mechanism to filter out alerts, usually they filter out alerts   that needed, going -- target why they had been alert, I told them   about the breach and only looked at it nine months later. And   then all of that leads to reactive investigation. And what the   industry is trying to do to fix that, ask any customer, they will   tell you that the SIEM is broken. Right now, the solution to the   SIEM broken is we're going to switch to another broken SIEM, with   the hope that, that out of broken SIEM is going to be better, and   it's not.",
    "And the more advanced companies in the industry, I figured out   that something has to be done. And what has to be done is you   have to collect much more meaningful data from the network or   from endpoints and so on, and provide much more meaningful   processing using machines of that data, right. So the SIEM   doesn't work. So why don't we create a new industry called EDR,   we're going to ask customers to put yet another agent on the   endpoint. We're going to collect a lot of data from the endpoint,   we're going to process the data with whatever machine learning   static accruals maybe we'll put some people on it. We're going to   find that things generate even more alerts because there aren't   enough alerts already, and maybe sometimes we're going to respond   back to the endpoint. Now that's not enough. We have to do the   same thing with the network. So there is a whole industry called   NTA network traffic analysis that's doing that on the network   stenting the collect deeper data from the network using separate   into in other data lake process that with rules and whatever and   machine learning and then maybe respond back usually they   generate just more or less in the same thing happens for IoT is   and the same thing happens for public cloud.",
    "And the same thing happens for South and I'm sure that with   every new challenge. The industry is going to generate yet in   other vertical that's going to collected another separate set of   data and all of that because the doesn't do anything. Okay. We   think that this doesn't make sense like specifically doesn't make   sense like why would you limit yourself to collecting their the   only from the endpoint process data just on the endpoint and   respond back, to the endpoint.",
    "We think there has to be something much better than that and   that's what Cortex is about, OK. Now maybe before that this is a   survey that Demisto company we acquired which late year. Before   we acquired them, you've heard it before an average enterprise   has to do with $174,000 per weeks. Usually they have the capacity   to handle may be 12,000 and even that gives them a few seconds   for each alert. It doesn't make sense that leads to at least four   days of investigating the alerts, so they figure out that they   need to investigate and some alerts that just don't touch are the   real alerts that they need to handle and we have to fix that and   that what Cortex XDR is about.",
    "And to do that, I'll go to my product guy, tell you how we're   --. So if we think about securing the future, we're really   talking about collecting good data, [Indecipherable] analytics   against it, leveraging as much automation as we can, because   manual work can be error-prone obviously it takes too much time   et cetera. But ultimately, we're trying to get to a proactive   outcome, trying to get away from the reactive something bad has   happened, let me figure out how bad it was and when it happen and   things like that to proactive, how do we actually prevent the bad   things from happening.",
    "So using that as a framework, it all starts with good data.   There is a massive amount of money that is being spent on   collecting logs and alerts, but not on selecting good data. You   have to collect good data in order to drive good analytics AI   machine learning and things like that. Now, to get the good data   we of course started with the best sources we know. Our next-gen   firewall crops in the endpoint, so our cloud services, we know,   because we can control those as sources. The kind of data, the   rich detail we can get in order to drive analytics. So that is   where we started. But now we are starting to extend that out to   third-party sources as well. As far the start of -- starting   point for that, it will be other network security devices. We're   going to start with checkpoint and probably on the Cisco and   other things like that. Because again in the enterprise, there is   still a bit of a mess, there is lots of different things, and so   while we try to move everyone to a better state we can help by at   least taking in that data correlating et cetera.",
    "So we are starting to now pull in third -party data to augment   our data sources to be able to drive good analytics. So what is   good analytics look like? Well, good analytics, first and   foremost, should be capable of detecting attack that otherwise   can't be detected, Cortex XDR does that for sure.",
    "In addition to that though, analytics is very powerful in   being able to reduce the amount of noise and alerts enterprises   have to deal with. We have seen in certain environments up to 50x   reduction of alerts by being able to just simply group them into   incidents to be able to then investigate incidents as opposed to   lots of alerts. We've also then seen the ability to reduce the   amount of time significantly and how long it takes to investigate   an incident by pre-stitching data together and showing the full   view to the analyst it is much, much more powerful and easy for   them to go through the investigation get to conclusion and   ultimately provide automation.",
    "Our aspiration here is to get orders of magnitude improvement   even from this, which by the way to the SOC, this is a massive   improvement for they otherwise are. And we're going to keep   focusing on driving these better outcomes. Now, good data to good   analytics, ultimately two really good automation. Automation is   where we can take a lot of the noise out of the system and really   lead the SOC counts, with just what they need to be able to have   to focus on. And again you can see the level of alert reduction   by simply automating the investigation response that humans don't   have to do the work. Improving the risk, the meantime to respond   some environments well north of 90% improvement, and how long it   takes to respond to incidents. That is massive benefit to an   enterprise to the SOCs.",
    "And going forward we have a view that we can even make this   automation predictive in nature. But based on everything that we   see across this growing ecosystem, we can build the network   effect, as we have done in many other areas. So that we actually   will be able to tell customers, this is what you should do in   order to achieve these outcomes. The security industry, the   cybersecurity industry needs to get more opinionated about how to   achieve the right outcomes as opposed to simply providing tools   and that customer is kind of do what they want with them.   Automation is a key area for this.",
    "Lastly, to bring this together, we are ultimately trying to   get to a proactive response footprint where again instead of   reactive or proactive. This is why traps on the endpoint is so   important to have Cortex function. Not only does it provide   really rich deep data in order to drive analytics and other   things like that, but it can actually prevent attacks from   happening in the first place. Every attack that is prevented   upfront means fewer and fewer alerts that even have to be   analyzed on the back end. Additionally, this is the footprint   that allows us to when we do finish -- when customer does finish   investigation, we can actually then automate the response back to   an enforcement point to take action. So we prevent on the front   end, provide rich data and then ultimately prevent on the   back-end as well. So we can automate that entire sequence.",
    "So we bring this together, each one of these components is in   itself best in class. But importantly, integrated together to   form the foundation of a platform, they can solve a lot of the   challenges that Nir talked about, that the SOCs currently deals   with, and are growing. So let's hear from one of our customers as   they talk about their adoption of Cortex and what would have   meant to them.",
    "[Video Presentation]",
    "Always cools and you can secure a state. And, of course, all   of this adds up to a large and growing town. The combination of   endpoint protection, analytics, automation and, maybe most   obvious, in this case, the ability then reduce the manual   outsourcing and pull that into product automation analytics as   well is the substantial opportunity we see it as well.",
    "And for that -- with that, like to invite Nikesh back up to   talk about execution. Nikesh?",
    " Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ",
    "Well, thank you, Lee and Nir. So, as I mentioned, we spend a   lot of time making sure we get our product strategy right, and   Lee and Nir, have highlighted where we plan to go. I hope you   didn't miss the fact that Lee is committed publicly to deploying   a lot of subscriptions in our firewalls and potentially applying   SD-WAN across every form factor. I'm just trying to make sure he   hears me, safe to use, so that I can make sure I can hold him   too. And we also talked about ingesting third-party data into   Cortex, which is an extension of our vision of our Application   Framework from the past. But product is just part of our   solution. Once you get product right, you've got to make sure you   have the execution capability to put the product out in the   market.",
    "And, as I've analyzed enterprise companies, it's very   interesting, there is very few very large enterprise companies   and many small enterprise companies. And it's interesting, if you   look at them, there is a distribution engine that needs to be   created just commensurate with your product capacity. Companies   get started, they get into a very good state with one set of   products and then either you have to keep innovating and adding   more product to the portfolio with the salespeople or you have to   acquire product and be able to ingest it in a way that your   salespeople are going to sell it. There is only one way to double   revenue, it's a double number of salespeople and make sure there   is enough capacity in the market, or make sure you double the   amount of product that a salesperson can sell and is able to sell   to be able to do that. Our intent is to do a little bit of   both.",
    "And what I wanted to highlight is, in addition to product   capability, we've also been working on our execution capability   and making sure we have the go-to-market. As Lee and Nir just   highlighted, and I ended my last session with saying, we can   address the $73 billion market. This is how that market breaks   out, we think there is a $27 billion opportunity in network,   approximately $8 billion in cloud, $13-odd billion in SOCs and   endpoint protection, and about $25 billion in the automation,   which needs to be deployed across all of those categories. It's a   slightly different view than you will see in the industry. The   industry still believe that it's going to be a very large   services market. We, on the contrary, believe that the services   market is important for the architectural pieces to get   cybersecurity, right, but if you need a lot of people to be able   to manage security for large enterprises on a long-term, that is   not going to give you the automation and the right outcomes and   it's going to require way too much time, while the adversaries   are working on automating their ability redact [Phonetic] you and   get to your precious data.",
    "So, as you see, we have 65,000 customers and we have an   amazing brand which people trust. Just to highlight, one of the   first subscriptions we launched early this year, we've been able   to deploy it to over 500 customers in a very short period of   time. So our sales teams know how the moment when you deploy a   subscription they're able to add it to our firewall capability   and get deployed in the market. As Lee talked about our IoT   capability, we want to make that available to every one of our   enterprise firewall customers, and one of you asked me, why   wouldn't to go acquire a more complex IoT company, there are some   larger companies in the IoT space that solve complex used cases.   I understand why as a start-up, you would go after a complex used   case because that's probably where the large deals are. But the   enterprise IoT is a need for every customer. Our salespeople know   how to sell it. We know how to attack the store of firewall. And   our aspiration is that, for every subscription that we deployed,   we should be able to get to thousands of customers, if not, tens   of thousands of customers in a two- to three-year timeframe,   which allows us to keep expanding both TAM and our revenue in a   leveragable way with our customer base.",
    "If you look at our current capabilities, we have 4,000   partners, we operate across 150 countries and we have 3,000   people out in the field, which makes us the largest pure play   cybersecurity sales team out in the field. We want to turn that   into a large distribution capability. We also believe that we   have built the best execution team in cybersecurity. I know many   of wrote in your notes about the management turnover at Palo Alto   Networks. Palo Alto Networks have build a phenomenal company,   which is firewall-centric, and we had done some stuff in the   cloud and some stuff in the SOCs. It is very important as we go   through this transition of building a multi-product,   multi-platform cybersecurity business that our management team   represents our capabilities which are required to be able to sell   multiple platforms in the market. And what we have done over time   is we've made sure that we are managing the transition and   upgrading our skill set for our team to make sure that we can   actually go sell cloud, we can go sell automation, we can go sell   AIML, we can go sell firewalls.",
    "I joined Google when there were 450 people in Google Europe.   We took that team from 450 people to 5,000 and we quintupled   revenue in five years when I was there. I left Google. Google is   now in its fourth generation of management today and they far   surpassed the quintupling of revenue from the early days. There   were 100,000 employees. So, as you go through evolution, you have   to make sure you bring your management teams and locks them. And   we're very comfortable that the transitions we are doing on the   management front are the continuation of our desire to build the   best execution. Rest assured, most of these management turnover   you're seeing, they're all managed transitions, they're all   toward the purpose of building this multi-capability   cybersecurity sales team. And you can see that we did our first   $1 billion billing this quarter in Q4, while we were going   through these transitions, which tells you that it would be a   very strong field sales force and they're all on-board with our   desire and ambition to build the best cybersecurity player in the   world.",
    "In the last year, we've hired over 2,000 cybersecurity   professionals. We have expanded our hiring limit, we now hire   from 19 cloud and next generation companies as opposed to purely   enterprise hardware businesses, which had been a lot of our core   sales team in the past. And we built technology, which allows us   to cross train our teams in cloud and in automation techniques.   This allowed us to train 3,000 people in a week to be able to   sell cloud. Why this is interesting is, this is an important   slide. This is what we anticipate in terms of how we are going to   take this and build this into the larger enterprise security   business. There we do it is, we ingest or innovate and build   technology, we put them in speedboats. We have a speedboat for   cloud, we have a speedboat for automation.",
    "We also started training our core sales team out in the field.   And this gives you a sense of what proportion of our field sales   force is able to sell our various products. So we've taken Prisma   Access and 60% of our sales teams out in the field is now able to   sell Prisma Access. This gives us huge amplification and   leverage, Prisma Cloud is closing in on 30%, 35% of our sales   force. And by the end of the year, we will have integrated   Twistlock and PureSec, allowing it to be part of the Prisma Cloud   platform, which will integrate seamlessly both from a contractual   and from a usage perspective. So every Prisma Cloud customer will   automagically have container and serverless capability and we   believe that leverage is going to allow us to address 40% of our   customer base. Our plan is to get our speedboat teams to be able   to sell to 90% of our entire -- through 90% of our core sales   force to our customer base, allowing us to leverage and the   distribution we need to become the biggest player, both in cloud,   as well as automation and SOC.",
    "No other player in our space has over 3,000 people in the   field out there selling. Not just that, we want to make sure we   do this while we continue to delight our customers. So we have   been able to maintain the leadership position and customer   happiness and customer success out of the market. Not only that,   we are not going to rest on our laurels. We have just announced   to our field team, we are introducing an industry first security   incident assurance service, whereby, if any of our customers   unfortunately is in a breach situation or any customer in the   industry, we're going to be there available until their breach is   resolved, irrespective of other what proportion of their products   of Palo Alto products. So, we continue to want to be at the   forefront of customer success and customer happiness in our   ability to execute.",
    "So with that, I now -- yes, there has been other conversation   about the channel. I think there was one meeting we had with the   Channel Advisory Board, which I think every analyst has feedback   on, anything for team, I have said that we've been tweaking our   channel ball with just causing consternation. But this is just to   give you comfort that 99% of our business still comes from the   channel. And as you can see in Q3 and Q4, because we revamped our   channel programs to create more capability, training and   incentive for our channel, the channel sourced business that   we're doing has never been greater than we've had in the last two   quarters at Palo Alto Networks. So, any noise around the fact of   channel and us are not together in this journey to building the   best cybersecurity business is just noise. We believe the true   signal is that, it's shown in the results. They're actually   allowing us to amplify our capability and they're really excited   about our newer acquisitions and the direction we're taking with   the various platforms.",
    "Okay. All right. This is all [Indecipherable]. Sorry, he has   taken us a long to get here. But until we give you a context,   it's very hard for us to take you to what do you're here for. So   with that, as you know, we've had a long history of success. We   have increased market share network security despite popular   belief that we're not going to be able to grow our security   business at twice the rate of the industry. The team and I spent   a lot of time over the last three or four months, looking at do   we need to go through our financial model transition at Palo Alto   Networks and have -- many of your notes about the two these   depression of cash flows duration what is Palo Alto going to do,   vis-a-vis ARR versus the term license or perpetual license. We   tested the market we talked to many of our customers. We talked   to many of the customers -- many of the company is going through   a transition and we're not going through any major financial   transition.",
    "Our customers like the way we sell our products for them, our   sales people understand how to sell products to themselves. We   are going to be selling firewalls the way we've been selling them   so far. We are not going to go to any term license model, we're   going to stick with the perpetual license model. And some of our   star [Phonetic] perform factors with sale and replaced firewalls   are going to be sold like firewall has sold. So based on all the   analysis, [Indecipherable] we will be building, a huge capability   to sell our next-generation security, we feel very comfortable   that we will be able to maintain the 20% billings growth rate   over the next three years, as well as a 20% revenue growth rate   over the next two years.",
    "I had the privilege over the last three weeks of looking at   every one of your models. I read almost every one of your notes,   and I can safely say, that this 20% guidance is above the average   of most of the models out there on the Street, both in revenue   and billings. But we stand behind the commitment that we believe   we can grow our billings and revenue at roughly 20% growth rate   going forward. An important part, I'd like to highlight one of   the shifts we are seeing, I'm sure you guys pay attention to   product revenues for the [Indecipherable]. We are seeing a shift   where we're replacing our competitors firewalls boxes with   software form factors of Prisma access. So what we've done is   we've taken our VM's, our Prisma access sales and our firewall   sales and said, what would it look like if we consider them all   as an upfront sale and how would our revenues or how would our   billings look like in the firewall category.",
    "So this is a combination of VMs, Prisma Access and firewalls.   We feel very comfortable that we will be able to grow the   firewall as a category billings by 23% over the next two years.   Which we believe is still 2.5 times the industry growth rate   vis-a-vis our firewalls are sold, then we think about product. I   will sure point you to the fact that because we anticipate a   large proportion of future firewall sales to be in the software   form factor. There will be a revenue recognition mix shift, which   will come through. But we still believe the category will grow at   23% over the next three years.",
    "Talking about the part, that we're really excited about,   really excited about our next generation security billings. We   were able to achieve $452 [Phonetic] million in billings in   Prisma and Cortex. So, what we call next-generation security.   We're guiding to $800 million to $810 million of billings for FY   ' 20 and we believe we will get to $1.75 billion by FY '22,   resulting in revenue of approximately over $1 billion for next   generation security revenue by FY '22. This is the part it takes   some spending to drive that fast revenue growth but FY '20 -- FY   '19 we've been able to manage the acceleration of our Prisma and   Cortex revenues by being able to reallocate from our core   business. We believe that we need to invest between $100 million   to $125 million next year to keep driving that revenue growth at   the pace we're committing to. But we believe thereafter, we will   be able to keep getting operating margin leverage by 150 basis   points in '21 and '22 and we believe the long-term operating   margin for our business should be 25%.",
    "I know you've been discussing cash flow a lot about us. We   feel comfortable, despite these investments, despite the shift   toward more services like software-based services and Prisma   access and VMs as well as cortex. We believe we will safely be   able to generate $4 billion of free cash flow over the next three   years, guiding to a long-term free cash flow margin of 30%.",
    "So before I talk about how we think about this, I thought it   would be important also to tell you how we intend to use the   cash. What we've done on M&A, as you've seen, there was a   fear when I came to a month ago that this guy comes from Google   is going to spend a lot of money and buy a lot of big stuff. Let   me highlight the key tenants of my M&A philosophy. First and   foremost, I prefer avoiding overlapping products. Overlapping   products are dangerous. We have products in most categories. I'm   not interested in buying other endpoint company, I'm not   interested in buying the firewall company, because that requires   [Indecipherable] basis, two sets of customers and is no leverage   for me, it's much more interesting for us to create innovation in   the category and displace those competitors as opposed to acquire   them, and just create scale. We believe we have scale in most of   our categories, hence we don't need to acquire customers of   overlapping product categories.",
    "We prefer targeting Blue Oceans. We like areas where there is   not enough people, we like areas where we can ingest technology   and deployed through our large distribution base, as opposed to   go and participate in valuations, where there is a lot of blood   [Phonetic] and not enough profitability. We seek technology that   will integrate across our platforms. If you look, we acquired   RedLock or emerging RedLock and Twistlock into a common platform.   We acquired PureSec, which is serverless to be integrated as   well. We would acquiring IoT which will be integrated into our   firewall capabilities, we acquired Demisto and which is being   integrated into Cortex.",
    "So we prefer acquiring technologies we believe fill an   important gap and also provide leverage to our go-to-market   engine, because if you acquired disparate products, then you have   to go train your sales forces on different go-to-market   capabilities and different USPs for our customers. We prefer   acquiring product excellence versus revenue, because they have to   be at large multiple for revenue, that rather not, rather   acquire, somebody has built a great product and it has good early   customers exhibiting product market fit. Every one of our   companies that we've acquired and I will talk about the slide in   a second. And last but not the least, we focus on large TAMs.   We're not interested in small towns unless there can be   subscriptions, which can be added to our firewalls, which allows   us to consolidate the enterprise.",
    "So with that strategy in mind, our approach in the first nine   months, we force our teams to right integrated product lens in   fact Zingbox, and Asheem already started talking about what the   product integration could look like, because our first and   foremost intent was to make sure that integration is done ASAP.   We see as soon as we acquire -- one of these good technology best   of breed companies are able to improve their business plan by   approximately 40%, which is what we've been able to do with the   Demisto pure sectors -- RedLock and many of our acquisitions.",
    "And we let their teams run their plays in the market with   go-to-market support from our speedboats. Beginning [Phonetic]   month 9 and 24, we start introducing them through our speedboats   to our core business, allowing us to get more leverage and more   scale across the acquisitions and we target doubling their plans.   Because of that, past 24 months, they become multiple accretive   to us as a business, that's a M&A philosophy, that should   give you a good sense of how we intend to use some of that cash   flow and as Lee and Nir have talked about, we are going to   constantly make build versus buy decision, so we can deliver best   of breed to our customers. And if you believe that we   [Indecipherable] not going to get there fast enough we'll make   acquisitions, but the acquisition will be guided by the   philosophy I just laid out, in terms of smart product teams. And   what is delightful is, I was just sitting early, I'm trying to   count.",
    "Of all the acquisitions -- we have over 12 founders working in   our company in our product organization from 12 months ago and   they are all committed to be here over the next two to three   years as part of Palo Alto Networks, so we make that a condition   of our position. So they're supposed to stay there and we   actually let them run their products, because we believe the fact   that they were able to go out against all odds and build the   great product and build a great business, it is incumbent and   imperative that we let them run that product for us at Palo Alto   Networks and to create the right circumstances, the right   capabilities for them to make that happen. So that's our plan in   M&A. So I thought what I would do is -- I would do what you   guys would do and see how do we compare against the industry. We   believe we are already the largest cybersecurity company and   we're growing faster than anybody else in our space. But this is   only half interesting. I find us even more interesting.",
    "If you take Prisma and Cortex which is our next generation   security business. In the last 12 months, we grew our billings by   89%. The next 12 months we're forecasting a 78% growth, which we   believe makes us the largest next generation security company,   compared to all the people out there who enjoy robust valuation.   I will leave the word robust.",
    "If you look at our forecast for FY'22, we believe we'll be   almost twice as big as any next generation security company in   our Prisma and Cortex category, while we're able to maintain our   firewall business generating huge amounts of cash flow.",
    "So, I like to call this a ServiceNow slide. I also reviewed   many Analyst Day presentations, and ServiceNow is kind enough to   build this slide and I understand this is where analysts geek   out, where this is something called the Rule of 40. You add your   cash, free cash flow margins and revenue growth and for some   interesting reason, over 40% is good and below 40% is bad. The   only problem is, ServiceNow left us out of this slide. Probably   we're not the -- we're the old 40 [Indecipherable] firewall   company, we're not the next generation security company, but we   decided to make our own version of the slide, so at least we feel   happy only look at this. And we're delighted to see that we rank   second from the left based on our last 12-month performance, and   we hope to stay far above that median of 38% over the next three   years.",
    "So with that, this is what we expect from our Company in   FY'22. We expect a 20% CAGR for total billings and total revenue   over the next three years. We expect to get to $6 billion in   total billings and $5 billion in total revenue by FY'22. We   expect that $1.75 billion of that total billings will come from   our next generation security services and approximately $1   billion of that will be revenue in FY'22. We expect to get back   to our current operating margins by FY'22 with a long-term target   of 25%. And we expect to generate $4 billion of free cash flow by   FY'22. So from here simple matter of execution.",
    "With that, let me call my friend, Kathy, who can give you more   specific guidance for FY'20 and for Q1.",
    " Kathy Bonanno    --   Chief Financial Officer ",
    "Okay. Thank you, Nikesh. All right. So that's a lot, talked a   lot about fiscal 2022 and about what we see in the coming years.   Let me just put a finer point on what we expect for fiscal   2020.",
    "So, am I moving these slides or somebody else? Okay. Since   it's a lot of data and information on the screen and these slides   will be made available to you, I'm going to focus primarily on   talking about the year-over-year growth rates. We will make these   slides available to you following the call. So for fiscal Q1   FY'20, we expect billings growth to be between 15% to 17%   year-over-year. We expect revenue growth of 16% to 17%   year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of   $1.02 to $1.04, which incorporates net expenses related to   acquisitions, including the Zingbox proposed acquisition, which   we've just announced.",
    "For the full-year of fiscal 2020, we expect billings to   increase between 17% to 19% year-over-year and we expect revenue   growth to be in the range of 19% to 20% year-over-year. As Nikesh   mentioned, next-gen security billings growth is expected to be in   the range of 77% to 79% year-over-year. We expect fiscal 2020   non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $5 to $5.10, which also   includes net expenses related to our recent acquisitions. And   finally, turning to free cash flow, we expect adjusted free cash   flow margin of approximately 30% for fiscal 2020.",
    "In this slide presentation, you will also find some additional   modeling points related to CapEx estimate, share count, tax rate,   the impact of M&A on EPS. I'm not going to read them to you,   but once again we'll make that available to you.",
    "So finally, we've summarized our fiscal 2022 guidance for you   as well on the screen, Nikesh already covered this, but hopefully   the format for fiscal 2022 will be easy for you to digest. And I   don't think it's on the screen, so perhaps -- yeah, perhaps I   should move it since I'm holding the clicker in my hands, sorry.   So, while we are investing to capture significant market   opportunity and we do see a gradual shift in durations, we expect   it to be gradual associated with changing mix of our products   toward more cloud and SaaS delivered products. As Nikesh   mentioned, we're not anticipating a big bang event. And so, for   the years beyond fiscal 2022, we're targeting our operating   margins to be above 25% and free cash flow margins at least 30%   or greater.",
    "So that hopefully will put some of your minds at ease. That   concludes our prepared remarks. And now we'll turn up the lights   and be happy to address any of your questions. Nikesh?",
    " Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ",
    "Are you guys happy? Come on give her a round of applause.   Tough crowd.",
    " Kathy Bonanno    --   Chief Financial Officer ",
    "Okay. We have people running mics. So I see some   questions.",
    " David Niederman    --   Vice President of Investor Relations ",
    "Please state your name and your firm before you state your   question, please.",
    " Jonathan Ho    --   William Blair & Company -- Analyst ",
    "Thank you. This is Jonathan Ho from William Blair. One of the   questions I had is regarding the next-generation growth, can you   unpack for us a little bit of the components that you see from   that next-gen side? And maybe how much that ties to the   investments that you're making? Thanks.",
    " Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ",
    "Yeah. Look, we're not going to break down the individual   components just yet. But in terms of the investment, we -- as I   mentioned, we've moved 1,000 people through acquisitions or   through organic hiring. We've taken our Prisma and Cortex or   next-generation security team to about 1,500 people out of 7,000   people. The highlights we ended FY'19 with. We anticipate adding   more people into those categories, both for R&D and for   sales. We feel reasonably comfortable that our core team is   robust in the size. So we'll be making small additions to our   core team but mostly we're focusing some of our newer hires into   Prisma and Cortex. Some of that spending is also a full year   impact of what we already invested going into Q3 and Q4 of this   year. So some of it is a follow on from Q3 and Q4 investment,   which we were able to manage with our budget for this year. But   some of it is incremental hiring for Prisma and Cortex.",
    "In terms of across the board, I can give you color that Prisma   Cloud is doing phenomenally well for us. It's really -- we need   to be out there in front of our customers a lot more. There is   over 20,000 -- 30,000 people selling public cloud between AWS,   Azure, GCP and Alibaba. There's probably a few hundred cloud   security salespeople in the world. So when we show up and   customers and we show them a demo and saying, look, this is what   you're not doing. They're, oh, yeah, I got to go cover my   security needs and when I write applications, they're just not on   secure themselves. So we're seeing really good traction for   Prisma Cloud.",
    "I think Nir made it abundantly clear how excited we are about   Prisma Access and how proxy style securing cloud-native   architectures is not a good idea. So Prisma Access is the huge   focus. Demisto has done well. Post acquisition it has followed   the M&A slide I showed you in terms of expecting to double   their business plan from where they are. So -- and XDR for us has   done really well, because we got 250 customers in the first full   quarter of operation and we continue to see more and more -- with   the addition of third-party data ingestion. And the way we think   about the ingestion, just to clarify, we just don't ingest data,   we make sure analytics engine can ingest that data and provide   analytics and suppress bad alerts and give you good signal and do   data stitching. So, our ingestion philosophy is more a philosophy   which works in building analytics around the data and then   ingesting the [Indecipherable]. So I think across the board we   anticipate robust growth, that's why we're comfortable guiding to   an $800 million to $810 million number.",
    " Kathy Bonanno    --   Chief Financial Officer ",
    "A lot of hands going up. Okay. Amber?",
    " Kenneth Talanian    --   Evercore ISI -- Analyst ",
    "Hi, Ken Talanian, Evercore ISI. When I look at that $6 billion   billings number, how much of that is from your existing product   set? And what are your assumptions around kind of current   acquisitions going into that and then maybe some of the future   acquisition assumptions that buildup to that?",
    " Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ",
    "Look, as Lee mentioned, that we believe many of the cloud   security products are not fully built in the market from a   maturity perspective. If you look at serverless, serverless we   think is 50% built, we bought PureSec, they have a product   roadmap, which is a robust product roadmap in front of them for   six to nine months. So we believe there will be interesting cloud   security based acquisitions we might have to do in the future,   which will fall in the M&A philosophy we highlighted. So,   some of those bolt-on technology, which haven't been developed or   anticipated, and our desire to build a cloud platforms for the   future. But there is no major plug in that number for us to go   out and acquire revenue to reach that $6 billion number. We feel   we should be able to get there with the majority of the products   we have in place with small bolt-on acquisitions as we see the   industry while the product marketable.",
    " Shaul Eyal    --   Oppenheimer & Co. -- Analyst ",
    "Thank you. Shaul Eyal with Oppenheimer. Nikesh, you have put   many concerns to rest course of the past hour, so.",
    " Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ",
    "Thank you.",
    " Shaul Eyal    --   Oppenheimer & Co. -- Analyst ",
    "So, one question I had in mind is...",
    " Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ",
    "But still I won. So go -- everything before the but is to be   ignore. Yeah.",
    " Shaul Eyal    --   Oppenheimer & Co. -- Analyst ",
    "As we think about your targets heading toward fiscal 2022 and   above, have you taken into consideration any changes with respect   to channel compensation, partners, anything with a go-to-market?   Or pretty much from our perspective, we should be thinking about   it mostly at a status quo going further?",
    " Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ",
    "There are no major assumptions in there in changing any   channel behavior in the process. We are seeing more activity in   the channel by telcos and by SIs like the Accenture's and the   Deloitte's of the world or AT&T's of the world or   Telefonica's of the world, they are becoming more active in   cybersecurity. If you look at most of the landscape, every telco,   every consulting organization is building very large   cybersecurity practices because they're trying not only   [Indecipherable] they're building cloud practices. So if you go,   this is the biggest fastest-growing segment of the SI and SP   space. So, yes, we anticipate they will have a bigger role to   play in how we are able to deploy some of our products in the   future. But to us, that's just evolution of channel. If they end   up doing more business, bring us to customers, we'll be there   with them just the way we are with the Optiv's [Phonetic] and   WWT's of today.",
    " Saket Kalia    --   Barclays -- Analyst ",
    "Thanks. Saket Kalia from Barclays. Nikesh you talked about no   transition to a term license model, for example, for the firewall   business, which was good to hear. But you also even suggested   that maybe some cloud products could be priced similarly to the   firewall. I think we mentioned that quickly. Could you just give   some examples of that and when that could actually start to   happen?",
    " Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ",
    "So what I -- sorry, thank you, first of all, asking the   question. I want to make sure I clarify. Sometimes our sales   teams bundle our annual products into three-year deals and sell   them like they would sell it upfront cash payment, which allows   us to get the cash flow just the way we get the cash flow for our   firewall products and roughly -- three years is roughly the term   for our hardware business in terms of contract durations. So   that's all I'm saying that, some of the cloud deal end up being   three-year deals instead of annual deals. So we still get the   benefit of the cash flow, so which is why Kathy alluded to the   fact that we're not anticipating large duration declines over the   next three years. We believe -- I haven't said this yet, but I'm   going to say it, we believe that the duration decline will be   approximately 10% over the next three years and hence, we believe   we are able to deliver -- we will be able to deliver the $4   billion of cash flow over the next three years.",
    " Saket Kalia    --   Barclays -- Analyst ",
    "Thanks.",
    " Imtiaz Koujalgi    --   Guggenheim Securities -- Analyst ",
    "Hi. It's Imtiaz Koujalgi from Guggenheim. Kathy, if I'm doing   my math right, based on your billings guide for next year and   your billings guide for the next-generation products. If I back   that out, it looks like you're guiding to the core business   growing at about 8% the firewall business, which is a big step   down from the 24% product growth we had this year. Is that the   right way to think about product growth next year in the   high-20s?",
    " Kathy Bonanno    --   Chief Financial Officer ",
    "Yeah. I think it's a little bit higher than that, but yes   that's close. The reason that we are looking at this firewall   technology as a group is because we're very excited about what   we're seeing from our customers in terms of demand for both   Prisma Access and our VM series. And so, that security category,   which Nikesh showed up on the slide earlier, we are expecting to   continue to grow at very rapid rates.",
    "Now, the mix may change a little bit in between there, but I   think our forecast still holds regardless. And the firewall   security itself, that in line security, that network security is   still a very important component for all of our customers, but we   are seeing great demand and great excitement about what Prisma   Access can do by delivering that security in a cloud form factor   really security-as-a-service. And so, we're very jazzed about our   possibilities going forward in terms of being able to win deals   that would have normally been one with firewalls, hardware with   that particular product and we think that we're the only   competitor that can really offer these various form factors to   our customers. And so, we see a really terrific opportunity.",
    " Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ",
    "Just to elaborate on that for a second. You saw two examples,   one Lee alluded to a very large retailer and we had a video from   another. In both cases we were competing with firewall boxes. And   we went in with Prisma Access with a differentiated strategy.   These are very large deals, as I've mentioned, one of them was   over $10 million, the other one was close. But in both cases, we   were able to displace the hardware form factor for competitors   because competitors did not have a software form factor. The good   news is, the software form factor deployment is a brief. If you   try and deploy a box in 2,000 locations in a retailer, it takes   them a year and a half or two years. The software, we can get   there in three to five months.",
    "So, part of what we are trying to do is, we're trying to   actually force that shift toward the software form factor because   as Nir mentioned, we don't believe our competition has the   capability to deliver the solution via the software form factor,   which allows us both to be differentiated, reduce speed of   deployment, allow it to run across hundred on-boarding points   from -- for our customers. So that's part of the assumption,   which you rightfully captured. We're actually trying to engineer   that bigger shift and trying to drive our business more toward   the software form factor.",
    " Imtiaz Koujalgi    --   Guggenheim Securities -- Analyst ",
    "Thanks. So, one more follow-up, Kathy. On the long-term   target, comparing what you gave us last time in 2017, you had   free cash flow margins long-term below operating margins. This   time you reversed it, your operating margins long-term are   actually lower than your free cash flow margin targets. What is   driving that reversal? Is it just more recurring revenues?",
    " Kathy Bonanno    --   Chief Financial Officer ",
    "Yeah. Can I just clarify? When we're talking about long-term   and I'm glad you asked this so I can get it out there for   everyone to hear. We're talking four to five years, right? And   the previous guidance that we had given, our long-term was much,   much further out when we're sort of growing at the rate of the   market is the way we described it. And at that point in time, we   assumed that we'd be a much greater cash taxpayer. And so, that   was the reason for the lower free cash flow margins. But we're   talking right now long-term for us is about four to five years   out. Okay? Thank you. And I said four to five, not 45. I need to   be very clear and enunciate.",
    " Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ",
    "45 would be great guidance. All right. Somebody has the mic?   There's question on this slide. David behind you.",
    " Kathy Bonanno    --   Chief Financial Officer ",
    "And I saw a woman with her hand up. I want her to get a   question, Fatima. Just don't ask us a hard one now. Just   kidding.",
    " Fatima Boolani    --   UBS -- Analyst ",
    "I'll go easy on you. I'm Fatima Boolani from UBS. Just a quick   point of clarification on the mix shift dynamics you're seeing in   the core firewall business, is that a displacement dynamic or are   you seeing the mix shift within the refresh of your own installed   base? I just want to clarify...",
    " Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ",
    "It's more of a displacement dynamic. I give you one specific   use case, but there are similar use cases in many places where --   whether it's a retailer, whether it's multi-branch situation or   multiple mobile user situation. We have customers with 100,000   employees or more who want to go to a Prisma Access type solution   for the mobile users. So, it's more -- it's mostly a displaced --   mostly a displacement of competition dynamic than it is a refresh   of our data center firewall business.",
    " Fatima Boolani    --   UBS -- Analyst ",
    "Understood. So my real question is...",
    " Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ",
    "I know where you're going, don't worry.",
    " Fatima Boolani    --   UBS -- Analyst ",
    "You talked about...",
    " Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ",
    "I've spent three months pouring over every one of these   numbers of Kathy, so I know exactly where you're going. Please   go.",
    " Fatima Boolani    --   UBS -- Analyst ",
    "You talked a lot about automation in each one of the pillars   of your corporate strategy. And so, if I think about your top 25   or your 25th largest customer spending close to $40 million per   annum with you. I mean, how should we think about that with the   automation opportunity and the fact that you expect to double the   size of your business in the next four to five years? I mean,   what are some of the dynamics there if your 25th largest   customers already spending $40 million with you?",
    " Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ",
    "So, let me use Cortex XDR as a use case, right. We have   thousands of customers who deployed Traps. The version of Traps   four months ago was not collecting data, sending it to a central   data lake, allowing us to do insights and analytics against it.   We are able to go back to every one of those large customers and   allow them to ingest data from there and give -- and upsell them   to Cortex XDR. So this is a use case for us where we take their   firewalls, we take their endpoints and say, why don't you collect   the data across the board, we'll analyze it to you, we'll reduce   the signal-to-noise ratio and we'll couple Demisto with it and be   able to give you automation going forward.",
    "So, that's the use case, for example, we can take our firewall   customers, our endpoint customers, add automation to this and   that budget comes out of their SOC budgets, because every one of   our customers is building SOC. SOC is the fastest-growing   category with about 20%-plus growth year-over-year, where people   are deploying more people and more data ingestion and more data   logging spend.",
    " Fatima Boolani    --   UBS -- Analyst ",
    "And do you foresee that more coming out of the wallets of   traditional managed security services providers you sort of offer   these Tier 1 type capabilities? And were are those dollars coming   from essentially?",
    " Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ",
    "Those dollars are coming from both SOC dollars, if you will,   there is such a category, but they are also coming from   efficiencies we're able to drive for those SOC owners, we are   saying, we can come in and instead of we put up some interesting   numbers up there, you out 8 times and 50 times in terms of alert   reduction. Traditional approach to alert reduction is hire more   SOC analyst. If he can walk and say, I can reduce the number of   alerts by 8 times and I can the reduce the number of alerts by 50   times, that's a huge amount of savings, which is coming out of   the SOC analysts that people have to hire and very few of our   customers are able to scale up their SOC to hire 300 SOC analysts   because it's kind of very interesting.",
    "One thing I learnt, which I can talk about, very few customers   delete policies. They are scare of deleting seven, eight of   firewall policies because somebody wrote them with some wisdom in   mind and the new guys says, oh, I'm not going to delete it. So   there is the poor SOC analyst trying to interpret, why is that an   alert? And the problem is, the alert keeps coming back because   they have no ability to go out and remediate that and fixed that   policy. So part of what Demisto is doing is, OK, we understand   you don't like alerts, so let's automate this so you can start   focusing on stuff that's important. That's why you end up with   that 174,000 alerts and not that I'm a hacker or a bad guy, but   if I understand how you prioritize the important alerts you   should look at, I'll spend my time trying to figure out how to be   under the radar.",
    "So part of our philosophy is, we want to look at every alert   out there and the only way he can get there is through   automation. Automation that works in the endpoint, automation   that works in your firewall, automation that works in your SOC,   so that's why if you notice, every one of our products has a   large automation TAM because we believe we're going to take away   from this services is the labor TAMs and put that into   automation.",
    " Fatima Boolani    --   UBS -- Analyst ",
    "Thank you so much.",
    " Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ",
    "Amber, in the back.",
    " Sterling Auty    --   J.P. Morgan -- Analyst ",
    "Hi, Sterling Auty with J.P. Morgan. So, one question for   Nikesh and Kathy, and if possible, can I throw a follow-up   question to Nir, if he still has his microphone?",
    " Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ",
    "Yeah. Our entire management team is here, of course.",
    " Sterling Auty    --   J.P. Morgan -- Analyst ",
    "All right. Fantastic. So Nikesh and Kathy, Nikesh you   mentioned the 10% reduction in duration over the next three   years, how much of that is actually going to be what you're   managing that duration to versus what customers want? Because one   of the positive feedback items that we received through the   channel over the last quarter or so is, finally, Palo Alto being   flexible on payment terms. And if God forbid, we do roll into   some tougher macro economic times, I could see more and more   customers perhaps wanting to only pay a year at a time instead of   three years upfront.",
    " Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ",
    "Kathy, you want to...",
    " Kathy Bonanno    --   Chief Financial Officer ",
    "Yeah. We are going to be very thoughtful about those   trade-offs in terms of what sort of financial incentives do we   have to provide in order to have our customers commit to us for a   longer period of time. We talked about last -- that issue last   quarter, and we talked about the fact that we were paying very   close attention to the economics of deals like that where our   customers really wanted to only pay us a year at a time. And   we're going to continue to do that. And if our customers demand   more and more of that, obviously, we will adapt to what our   customers are wanting. But we actually find that there are a lot   of customers who are very comfortable with the way they pay us   today very comfortable with our billing practices to date. And   so, we're not seeing this huge surge of demand. It tends to be   occasional request that we handle on a one-off basis. Potentially   it could become larger in the future and, of course, we'll adapt   to that over time. But the big shift that we've been talking   about -- I'm sorry, Nikesh, is really driven more by the mix   shift of the products and primarily the growth of Prisma Cloud,   which we talked a little bit about last quarter having shorter   contract durations, which we talked about.",
    " Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ",
    "And sorry, just to add to that, I've discovered over the last   13 months, the industry has certain compensating mechanisms   already in place. And there are customers who want to pay on an   annual basis and the industry -- the channel wants to facilitate   it. They figured it out with some sort of financing and they show   up at our doorstep with the entire contract durations worth of   cash flow. So, it's been around for a very long time, and there   are many enterprise companies which have financing arms and all   different kind of tactics to enable that cash flow generation. So   we haven't assumed any of that stuff, we believe that life will   go on as normal.",
    "But I have the inevitable Nir here, you wanted to   question.",
    " Sterling Auty    --   J.P. Morgan -- Analyst ",
    "Exactly. The follow-up, Nir, when you were talking about   proxies, you did Gen 1 kind of Gen 2, but when we're thinking   about Prisma and the competition going forward, you didn't really   kind of call out the name. So I want to be very specific in terms   of understanding who you think...",
    " Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ",
    "You think we didn't call out the name. Okay.",
    " Sterling Auty    --   J.P. Morgan -- Analyst ",
    "Nikesh, you touched upon. Who do you think is going to be the   core competition in terms of Prisma Access moving forward? I   mean, we all think probably Zscaler is going to be part of it.   But what about the Akamai and the other companies that are in   that space? And what do you think happens to kind of the   traditional firewall vendors, do they all get squeezed out or do   they come up with offerings as well? Thanks.",
    " Nir Zuk    --   Chief Technology Offcer ",
    "Yeah. I -- so I think the competition is Zscaler. However, I   strongly believe that the right architecture and the right   products at the end of the day win. And we've been told that may   be multiple times, right? FireEye, for example, right? A long   time ago, FireEye came out of the market and they had this idea   of running sandboxes and signatures are dead and the entire world   is going to ship to FireEye and some of you even bought that   story, but it was the wrong technical solution. First, sandbox is   not going to replace everything and second, from a technical   perspective, a sandbox needs to do prevention, no detection. It   has to be in line and it has to be across entire infrastructure,   which means it needs to run off the firewall. And that's why they   went their way, we went our way and we all know how it ended up   for both of us.",
    "So, I think that we're facing the same situation right now.   There is the right technical way of doing something and the right   way to deliver a product to the market, then there is the wrong   way. And proxies have always been the wrong way and firewalls   have always been the right way, being in the network, part of the   network, being a packet-based device, participating in routing,   participating in network optimization, and being able to support   all applications, not just few applications, not breaking   applications. I don't know if you know, if Microsoft recommends   that when you use Zscaler, you turn -- you don't use Zscaler when   you go to Office 365. Why? Because it breaks Office 365. Because   that's what proxies do. And it's their own technical solution and   I strongly believe that the right technical solution will   win.",
    "Now, if you look at what's involved in Access in the modern   access into the cloud and back into the infrastructure -- into   their corporate infrastructure for mobile users and branch   offices, you need to do a lot of different things. And our   competition today, different competitors do different things. I   don't see a single competitor that does both the application   security part of it, the firewall side of it, the CASB side of   it, the SD-WAN part of it, they are back to corporate side of it,   I just don't see anyone that has the complete portfolio to be   able to do what we're talking about. Yes, there are the firewall   vendors, the firewall vendors, like I said, are still busy   figuring out why they can't sell their hardware against ours.   While we've been spending the last several years building our   virtual firewall and building our cloud-delivered firewall to a   point where I just -- it's just -- they are three to five years   behind at least, plus the amount of time they are behind our   hardware firewall is, I just -- I don't see competition from   them.",

    "I'm going to recall...",
    " Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ",
    "What Nir means to say is, we respect our competition and we   are glad that we're able to build amazingly large businesses and   serve the customers' needs with cybersecurity. I think that's   what he said.",
    " Matthew Hedberg    --   RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst ",
    "Matt Hedberg, RBC. It seems like every other question of   investors is macro, you guys delivered strong results, obviously,   some very large deals this quarter and the guidance on a   multi-year view is very strong. I guess, Nikesh, when you're out   talking to executives, what is the pulse of buying behavior out   there right now? And then I have a quick product question for Nir   as well.",
    " Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ",
    "Yeah. What's interesting and maybe I'm going to ask our   President, Amit Singh, who you have not seen in this context. He   can talk more because he has been out there on the road grinding   away. So you guys get to tell the good stories, I get to go out   there in the field and grind. So, let's have you come up.   So...",
    " Kathy Bonanno    --   Chief Financial Officer ",
    "Oh boy.",
    " Amit Singh    --   President ",
    "Hello, everyone. The climate for cybersecurity is quite   strong, the acquisitions. It's driven by all the challenges you   see in the papers and buying behavior is actually quite solid.   The movement toward software and software-delivered is a real   one, so -- and we are actually very, very excited about the   products that we have, both on the product side, as well as the   service delivery side of it, because these are cloud-delivered   solutions, it's a backdrop that I come from.",
    "And interesting, when you look at any trend, whether it's how   many software start-ups were funded, cybersecurity start-ups, all   the way to the actual market spending, it's very, very solid.   Your question was, I think, on the macro picture. We haven't seen   any slowdown. We haven't seen slowdown, you saw some of that   numbers we shared around pipeline, pipeline growth, partner   generation pipeline and clearly, our Q4 performance is a measure   testament of being able to hold the core business, while being   also able to generate brand new businesses and scale them.",
    " Matthew Hedberg    --   RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst ",
    "And then maybe just a quick product question. Nir, when you   think about consolidating security spend, what's sort of your   view on identity? It's -- obviously, it's a hot category out   there. What role is identity have in the Palo Alto platform?",
    " Nir Zuk    --   Chief Technology Offcer ",
    "Sure. So first, most of our customers integrate our network   security with identity, because identity needs enforcement, and   in most cases, the firewall is going to do a bit of thing that   performs the enforcement. Actually, the only case where it's not   the firewall is when you access SaaS applications. In all other   cases, it's the firewall that enforcing the identity, sometimes   the applications themselves as well. So that's the rough   identity.",
    "Now, if you look at the market today, I think most of the   market is focused on what's called hygiene, meaning who can   connect and who cannot connect to an application, which is   interesting but it's becoming commodity. I think the most   interest -- the more interesting part of Identity is identity   analytics. So being able to take identity events and figuring out   attacks from the identity. So that's -- I think that's one area   that's not being addressed today by the market and is an   opportunity.",
    "I think that's the other side of identity that is still yet to   be decided by the market is, how do you do machine-to-machine   identity, especially in the cloud. And I think the jury is still   out on that and that's -- that could be one day an interesting   thing to look at.",
    " Philip Winslow    --   Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst ",
    "Hi, Phil Winslow, Wells Fargo. Just wanted to focusing on the   firewall platform billing slide and there you break out your   firewall hardware versus Prisma and the VM series, we already --   so we talked a lot about Prisma Access here today, but wanted to   focus my question on the VM series. One of the questions I get a   lot from investors is attach rate of VM series and attach rate of   firewall in the public cloud environment. And so, it's kind of   question to the whole team here is that, one, how are you   thinking about contribution VM series to the forward billings?   But also, where are we in terms of increasing attach rates of VM   series and call it your hybrid cloud, multi-cloud security?",
    " Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ",
    "Quick clarifying question, what you mean the attach of the VM   series?",
    " Philip Winslow    --   Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst ",
    "The -- instead of call it like the out-of-the-box firewall   that you got -- get from a cloud vendor, Azure, AWS attaching   actually VM series to that workload and the like.",
    " Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ",
    "So we're very pleased with the VM series and how it's done.   The -- when it first came out, we were focused on the private   cloud use case because at the time that was the first generation   of cloud, and then it's evolved really well as more workloads   have shifted into public cloud infrastructure. VM series today   supports all of the major cloud vendors in US Azure, GCP,   Alibaba. It's evolved in a number of ways that are very specific   to cloud in terms of how we integrate it with different   orchestration platforms, how would do automation. We're the only   security vendor, for example, especially supported with   Terraform, which is one of the main sort of multi-cloud   automation orchestration tools out there. We are sellable to all   the marketplaces. And we actually have a very nice business and   growing business with VM series being consumed through the   marketplaces. So, there is a lot of really good things that are   happening there.",
    "The -- I'd say, the only sort of challenge that -- may not the   only challenge, but big challenge relative to your question is, a   lot of companies will first try to get by without real security.   And the -- through various mechanisms and often is through   unfortunate events where something bad happens to a company that   triggers the people to actually really go back and pay attention.   But that's the only challenge is sort of getting people over the   hump of trying the thing that they think might be good enough   before they realize that what they really need is best-in-class   security and understand that we can do the cloud integration   aspects that they also knew. Okay?",
    "A question here.",
    " Karl Keirstead    --   Deutsche Bank -- Analyst ",
    "Great. Karl Keirstead at Deutsche Bank. First of all, Nikesh   for a guy who a year ago said that you no longer giving annual   guidance only next quarter, thank you for the reversal.",
    " Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ",
    "Appreciate it. I'll -- adaptive dynamic earn. Yes.",
    " Karl Keirstead    --   Deutsche Bank -- Analyst ",
    "I wanted to, let's say, stress test your confidence in 20%   billings and revenue growth over the next three years. And, I   guess, I'm saying this in the context of you having just put up a   quarter where you grew both metrics by 22%. So you just put up   22% and you're saying you're going to grow 20% for the next   three. At first that sounds a little bit optimistic, especially   given that you're on stage as well talking about a hardware to   software form factor shift, which if we look at firms like F5 and   others that are going through this. It tends to be quite dilutive   to your overall growth rate. So, is it that that form factor   shift you expect only to be quite gradual and you can kind of   skate around it? Or is it that you're emerging products are just   growing so damn fast, but despite that you can still get to 20%?   Thank you.",
    " Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ",
    "First of all, thank you, Karl. If I'm allowed to clarify, I   was not comfortable giving guidance when I walked in because I   didn't understand the levers of the business. Not did I   understand the industry and nor did I understand the levers of   the Company, and I hate to stand up on stage and comment on   behalf of 7,000 people without having some degree of confidence   and comfort in our ability to deliver. So, I appreciate you guys   and during the last one year of our quarterly guidance, but I   think hopefully we have given more guidance and put a large news   around our necks. Now, we have to go out and deliver this stuff.   So, thank you for reminding me of that.",
    "In terms of our comfort level, I want to parse your question   into two or three parts. One part is, we are seeing unabated   growth in cloud, generally and I alluded to the fact that there   is not enough cloud security out there and there has not been   enough people enumerating the need for cloud security. I will not   take the name of the customer but there has been a recent breach,   where it was a cloud breach. And I can tell you that got the   phones ringing because people suddenly realized that you can have   cloud breaches, even though you are using a public cloud   provider, security cannot be used as an open source set of tools.   You have to go find a security product to secure cloud instances   as you start putting more and more important crown jewel data out   there.",
    "So, we believe that that's going to drive more of the VM use   case, we believe that's going to drive a lot of the Prisma cloud   use case. We're also seeing -- as the question was asked and then   Amit answered. We're also seeing a lot of rearchitecting going on   as people go through their rearchitecting of enterprise. If you   look at companies, right, there is no CIO out there who is not   thinking about how do I go to the cloud. So this is very   important. So if I'm going to the cloud what do I do with my   enterprise IT, what do I do with my security? How do I rethink   it? And as they're rethinking it, they're rethinking their   branches. You go to a retailer, retailer needs to put a lot of   bandwidths into their branches. In the past, there was little   bandwidth, you needed your POS systems to work, all that's you   needed. Today, they want AR and VR in the store. They want to   move customer data back and forth, suddenly they need security in   the store. So we believe there is some degree of new use cases   being created, which is driving some of the confidence we have in   some of our newer services. And we believe our core business   continues to be strong. The underlying core business and the   customer base continues to be strong. We fully realize that we   are going roughly from, let's say, $3.5 billion number to a $6   billion number, which means we have to kind of double, as I've   said, there's only one way to double, have more product or have   twice as many salespeople, I hope that there is twice many   customers out there that you can get. So we think the balance is   right and we should be able to execute. We've done a lot of   investing in FY'19 in Q3 and Q4 and ramping up both our core   capability as of some of our speedboat capability, now we're   stretching our team has got to deliver. We'll give it our best   shot.",
    " Pierre Ferragu    --   New Street Research -- Analyst ",
    "Pierre Ferragu, New Street. Nikesh, first of all --. Pierre   Ferragu, New Street. Nikesh, first of all, thank you very much   for not changing your business model. It took me a very long time   to figure it out and I spent [Speech Overlap]",
    " Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ",
    "It taken me 12 months to figure out, then I had to go figure   out what the other guys [Speech Overlap]",
    " Pierre Ferragu    --   New Street Research -- Analyst ",
    "[Speech Overlap] what have done so far. That's great. And it   gives me the opportunity to ask more of a product question to   Nir. And so, you explained very well how you plan to completely   crush all proxy-based competitors. And I was wondering, and   you've defended it very well all the -- all what you have already   in your development in the next-generation firewall and all what   you've done from there. But I was wondering how you transfer that   benefit to technologies you're acquiring. So, for instance, if we   look at the components of Prisma Cloud, when they came in first   day what did you do? How did you integrate their technologies   with your existing technology? How did they benefit from that?   And then your clients using it, how does it benefit from having a   Palo Alto Networks firewall and having Prisma Cloud in the same   environment?",
    " Lee Klarich    --   Chief Product Officer ",
    "Yeah. Thank you for the question. So, Nikesh mentioned a   couple of the principles that we now apply more vigorously in   terms of the incoming companies, level responsibility we give   them, the expectations we put on the founding teams of these   companies to continue to execute, as well as to build an   integration plan. And it's interesting you asked about Prisma   Cloud, that was formed out of the basis of two acquisitions,   Evident.io and RedLock. The integration of those two together   took us about four months. Four months to integrate two products   into a single platform. It now forms the foundation where we'll   be able to then further integrate Twistlock and PureSec into that   platform continue to extend it out. Again, pulling the leadership   teams of the companies into this together in order to make sure,   and then building an execution plan that includes the integration   that we all agree on very quickly after the acquisitions happen.   And we're very much in the midst right now of executing on that   with an expectation that by the end of this calendar year those   will now be new modules in the Prisma Cloud platform.",
    "So, a lot of this is around giving the right people the right   responsibility, the right accountability and then executing. And   we're showing that we can do this a very good success. On the   customer side then, what they're seeing is, very easy adoption of   additional cloud security capabilities showing up in the same   platform that they're already used to. They simply get to consume   and deploy against our cloud workloads, which is a very powerful   a go-to-market and adoption aspect that the products are   enabling.",
    " Nir Zuk    --   Chief Technology Offcer ",
    "Yeah. Another example will be XDR. So we bought an EDR   company, we bought in NTA company, right, Secdo and LightCyber   and integrated both together. Nobody believed we can do that.   Nobody believed we can take network data, take endpoint data,   combine them together and generate meaningful analytics based on   that. And we're the first one to do it, and like I said, EDR, NTA   as their -- and they're don't make sense and now we're going to   integrate -- we plan to integrate more and more things into   it.",
    "Now, the other type of integration that we have, which I think   we partly ask about is, when we buy someone like Zingbox, or we   develop something like DNS security, it becomes a service that is   attached to our firewall. And all the customer has to do to use   it is to flip a switch. You flip a switch and you use the   service, and you test it for a week, a month, whatever, you like   it you buy it, you don't like it, you don't buy. And most   customers, they're turning to and they see things that they just   can't not buy the product. And the interesting thing is that,   those services apply to all form factors. So if you have a   physical firewall, you do that, if you bought Prisma Access, you   turn in and you do that. If you went with a competitor, with a   proxy competitor and you want to do IoT security in the branch,   which you do, like you need to secure printers and you probably   have IP phones and video cameras and other things connected to   the network in the branch, what do you do? You have to go to an   IoT security company, you have to the buy their product, you have   to deploy it in the branch and you have to do deploy it in 2,000   branches, if you have 2,000 real points and somehow   operationalize it. With Palo Alto Networks, if you are a Prisma   Access customer already, you turn on a switch, immediately it   applies to all your branches, you like it you buy it, you don't   like it you don't buy it. It's that simple. Okay?",
    " David Niederman    --   Vice President of Investor Relations ",
    "There are other question right next to the gentlemen.",
    " Keith Bachman    --   BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst ",
    "Hi, it's Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Nikesh and Kathy   for you, is M&A inclusive or exclusive of what you just put   up on the board? And what I mean by that is, as we think about   the revenue outlook and billing outlook, I assume that the   context of that is mostly smaller deals probably don't move the   M&A, but I just wanted to see if you could clarify. And it   relates to you as well Kathy on the margins, this year you're   suggesting that margins go lower but thereafter, they'll move   higher. And so, is that again M&A neutral? So if you do some   deals you might ask for forgiveness for the margin growth that   you're suggesting in the outer years if in fact you do pursue   M&A even some smaller deals that might pressure those margin.   So, inclusive or exclusive is the shorter question of   M&A?",
    " Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ",
    "So to give you a framework, it's exclusive of any large   M&A, which has a significant revenue acquisition component.   So, if you go buy a company for $100 million of revenue, where --   that's not part of our plan, as I said to the gentleman earlier,   there is no plug in these numbers that we're going to be   acquiring $200 million, $300 million revenue growing at 50%   right, that is not a bad stuff. We're not looking for M&A as   a strategy. We're looking as platform as a strategy.",
    "Now, in the platform context, if you think about, are we   better off going back and, for example, we built Cortex XDR from   the acquisitions. We've put it -- we got the teams to integrate.   We didn't sell it for six months. We got them to integrate and   sold it after. They put it together. Twistlock, RedLock, PureSec,   we integrated and we're deploying it across our platform. So if   you find there is a product need and a product market fit that   needs to be integrated across the platform that stuff will have   to be acquired and we'll keep you posted as we acquire them, what   the impacts of those are financially. We have not built any   expectation saying we're going to be doing $500 million of   acquisitions every year and it's going to have certainly EPS   impact, we're going to take that and take into these numbers.   These are raw numbers, organic, Kathy has told you FY'20 has a   $45 million M&A for this year, after one year we roll that   into our organic numbers. So FY'21, 2022 there's no -- there'll   be unless we do something between now and then there is -- those   will become organic numbers.",
    "One thing I think there was a clarification question which I   want to announce publicly, somebody asked a question about the   duration of 10%, is that every year or across three years? The   answer is over three years, not every year.",
    "I'm trying to keep my friends out of jail, I heard that   broadband is poor in Jail, so. And still on MPLS.",
    " Michael Turits    --   Raymond James -- Analyst ",
    "Sounds good idea. My wife just watching the [Indecipherable]   black last night. So I don't want you there. Michael Turits from   Raymond James. Question on -- for Nir and Lee, you guys talked   about SD-WAN and SD-WAN is big and a big part of what Fortinet   has been talking about for some time. So I'm trying to think   about, first of all, how do you become an SD-WAN player? What are   you going to do with it? Is it similar I think to what Fortinet   is doing and saying, hey, we can do this too and function the   SD-WAN? Or are you going to use it to help improve GlobalProtect   cloud services networking component, because that's also a big   place for Zscaler wins is by doing networking that they say   salespeople money?",
    " Nir Zuk    --   Chief Technology Offcer ",
    "Yeah. Doing networking with a proxy, that's interesting,   but...",
    " Lee Klarich    --   Chief Product Officer ",
    "He doesn't need anymore encouragement.",
    " Michael Turits    --   Raymond James -- Analyst ",
    "I just want to get him proud -- I have seen him perform for a   while.",
    " Nir Zuk    --   Chief Technology Offcer ",
    "Yeah. So SD-WAN, SD-WAN -- so maybe 30 seconds on what SD-WAN   is. So, just a word on same page. As applications move to the   cloud and it stops making sense to the MPLS, you want to -- you   start using regular Internet connection through IDSL, cable   modems, whatever, D3s, E3s, whatever you can get. The challenge   with that is that, they don't provide you the same reliability   and performance guarantees that MPLS does. So, all of the sudden,   you start relying on applications in the cloud like Office 365   and G Suite and Salesforce.com or your own applications in public   cloud, but you cannot get the same guarantees. So SD-WAN is about   taking multiple Internet connections like a DSL from one provider   and a cable modem from another or 2DSL or a DSL and LTE or 5G, so   on and so on, and somehow doing some kind of networking tricks on   them such that with the tool or more links you can get to the   same reliability and the same guarantees more or less that you   get from MPLS, of course, at a much lower cost, much higher   bandwidth, which is what those applications in the cloud   need.",
    "Now, there are multiple ways of doing that, you can do it in   the branch itself, meaning you can take the firewall that is in   the branch and you can add SD-WAN to that firewall and do that --   those networking tricks to make those multiple Internet   connections appear much more reliable. And we're doing that,   meaning we are building that and that's going to become a   subscription on top of the firewall, that's like Lee said, where   if you deploy our firewalls in the branch, we do that and in that   respect, it's somewhat similar to what other SD-WAN vendors are   doing, of course, with a differentiation being much better   security. Right? We always weigh in on security.",
    "The other option to do it -- and which we do today as well   with SD-WAN partners and we'll continue to do is to use SD-WAN to   bring the traffic to Prisma Access. Prisma Access, which is a   bunch of firewall deployed in the cloud, need the traffic   together. Now, you can do it with traditional IT sector or   something like that, a much more efficient way to do it is with   SD-WAN. So your program your SD-WAN your software-defined WAN to   bring the traffic to Prisma Access and then you do all the   security work in Prisma Access. The advantage of that is that you   don't have to deploy a new security box in the branch every few   years, because technology goes fail and you need to upgrade,   which is kind of like painting the Golden Gate Bridge, right? You   start, you deploy 2,000 branches, by the time you finish the   2,000, you have to start from the beginning, with Prisma Access   you don't have to do it and that's what the real differentiation   is. So doing SD-WAN in the cloud rather than doing SD-WAN in the   branch and using SD-WAN just to bring the traffic to the cloud is   the right way to do SD-WAN but for that you need to have   something like Prisma Access, and you need to have a networking   Prisma Access, not something that breaks the TCP connections and   restarts them, which is not networking based. It's called a   proxy.",

    "Erik Suppiger, JMP. Couple of questions, one on the free cash   flow margins. Is the primary cause for the decline this year   duration or what should we think of as the primary hit on the   margin front? I'll ask the second question after that.",
    " Kathy Bonanno    --   Chief Financial Officer ",
    "Yeah. The primary reason for the decline is the same primary   reason you see for our operating margin decline, and that's the   investments that we're making, not only organically to drive the   new areas of our business, but also the M&A investments that   we've made.",
    " Erik Suppiger    --   JMP Securities -- Analyst ",
    "Okay. And then for...",
    " Kathy Bonanno    --   Chief Financial Officer ",
    "Which is why we expect it to turn around.",
    " Erik Suppiger    --   JMP Securities -- Analyst ",
    "Okay. Then for Nir or Lee, XDR, is that product   production-ready? How much of that -- how can we gauge the   success of XDR from here? Because we've had Traps out there for a   while. Is this something that's going to be a viable competitor   to CrowdStrike at this point? Or how should we be thinking about   that? And how much of that is getting sold outside of your   installed base?",
    " Lee Klarich    --   Chief Product Officer ",
    "So, as we mentioned earlier, we're actually very happy with   how XDR has done. Now, it's early. We announced it about -- and   released about four and a half, five months ago. You saw the   results for the first full quarter, number of customers we added.   So, very excited about the initial market reception, customer   reception to XDR. And the messages that we talked about here are   things we're hearing from our customers. Very powerful -- the   ability to integrate the -- and stitch the endpoint data with the   network data. No one else can do that, no one else can give the   end-to-end visibility, reducing the number of alerts, reducing   the amount of time it takes them to actually investigate   incidents. So all the things we said here are -- they're here   because that's what we're hearing from our customers that have   adopted XDR. Okay?",
    "The -- and the interesting aspect of this is, that is enabling   us to really sort of change the conversation with our customers   to one that is a very strategic conversation about the shift   toward, not just endpoint protection, but the shift toward   analytics and ultimately toward automation and tying that with   Demisto. Okay?",
    " Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ",
    "So going back to the theory --",
    " Nir Zuk    --   Chief Technology Offcer ",
    "Proxy, almost similar. No. This is another case where I think   that the right technical solution will win. EDR doesn't make any   sense. It really doesn't make any technical sense to limit   yourself to collecting data just from endpoints, limiting   yourself to processing data just from endpoints and then   responding back to the endpoints, where we all know that the   Traps happen across the entire infrastructure. They can start in   the SaaS application and then take over an endpoint and then   propagate through the network and end up in the public cloud,   where your data is.",
    "It -- the right technical way of doing it is to collect data   from multiple parts of the infrastructure into one place, use   your analytics, all your people or whatever it is to go through   the entire data, find the attacks-based information in the entire   data and when you find an attack, it doesn't matter where the   signal came from, you want to respond back to the entire   infrastructure, which is kind of where Demisto comes in,   responding back to the entire infrastructure. And I just don't   see the competition doing that. I don't see the competition doing   more than just basic endpoint data collection and response.",
    "So, assuming we get the right marketing and the right sales   and marketing around it, go-to-market and there are some missing   product features, I think that next time we'll be able to talk   much more about where we are versus the competition.",
    " Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ",
    "If I may elaborate on that from a market activity perspective,   and given that we've only had 4.5 months worth of great   experience with the product in the market against the competitor   you mentioned, we -- remember 12 months ago, we didn't have a   dedicated sales force that could compete in terms of on a   point-by-point basis against some of these competitors because we   had a core sales team, which was aren't as fully adaptive selling   this product.",
    "Now that we have speedboat teams out there, it's fair to say,   we saw CrowdStrike in between 25 and 30 deals, which were in our   installed base, because that's why we went after first, and I   think the number is we were able to beat them in 75% of the deals   we saw them in our installed base. Again, it's one data point.   But we're slowly getting our act together and getting better at   this stuff. But six months ago, we didn't have a product. Traps   would not compete against EDR because Traps endpoint protection   did not do an XDR. We launched XDR, we've made Traps free. We   have thousands of customers using Traps. Our first target is go   to the customers who already have Traps, they already have a   Firewalls, who better than them to make sure that they can buy an   XDR and we're delighted that 75% of them were CrowdStrike   [Indecipherable] more deals than we do because they have a larger   sales force, but we're delighted that we were able to beat in 25%   -- 75% of those deals.",

At the Gartner Security Conference,   a few months ago Zscaler was on stage at the keynote and they had   a few customers on stage as well, that said, they tried your   GlobalProtect cloud service, which you're now calling Prisma   Access and didn't get the performance that they were looking for.   It wasn't scalable. I guess, can you just talk about how you've   changed or fixed the performance in the architecture?",
    " Lee Klarich    --   Chief Product Officer ",
    "We -- it was a company, it was not existing customer. And they   had actually selected said competitor. So we had an opportunity   to get in one last chance and they told us the same thing. And we   said, can you share with us the test that you're doing? And it   was provided by the competitor and it was a flawed test. We were   able to show them how it was a flawed test and after they readed   the test to no longer be a flawed test, Prisma Access performed   wonderfully. So -- and that was before. The most recent update to   Prisma Access where we now have over 100 on-boarding locations   around the world.

    "This is a fantastic presentation today. My question is   actually really simple. Three months ago, if we listen to your   remarks in your       earnings call    , you talked about a transition.",
    " Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ",
    "Yeah.",
    " Brad Zelnick    --   Credit Suisse -- Analyst ",
    "There is not much of a transition.",

    "Yes.",
    " Brad Zelnick    --   Credit Suisse -- Analyst ",
    "Why?",
    " Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ",
    "Good question. I'm glad you asked it. Four, five months ago we   were going full speed ahead analyzing every which way we can make   this transition to a fully ratable model. And when we sat down   and looked at it from an accounting perspective, a legal   perspective, a go-to-market perspective, we would have to impact   the channel, our salespeople, we all step back and said, OK, why   are we doing this. Our customers are buying billions of dollars   of products from us. They have a motion. Our salespeople know how   to record it. How to sell it. And we sat down and said, we're   doing it because the industry likes our models, our software   models. I personally like money upfront. Cash flow is a good   thing. You go out and hunt, use some this year, rest of them you   put in a cold store and use it in year two, and year three. Why   do I have to go hunt every year if I'm going to go to analyze   model?",
    "So, we just felt that we were trying to unnaturally change the   Company's business model and transition to a place, which is more   akin to a pure software SaaS ARR-based model and we are -- it's   kind of a hybrid business. We have a firewall business very   strong, and we're building the next-generation security business,   which we believe is going to be very strong and some of the   characteristics of this we really like. We like the upfront cash,   we like the cash flow that this brings us. We like the fact that   it gives you long-term deferred revenue, which allows you to be   amortized. So we decided that we're better off going this way. So   this is why we're here. And then we were comfortable that we've   analyzed everything -- every Sunday. This Analyst Day has been in   the making for six months. Right? We've been trying to look at   what we want to come and tell you, what's important, what's not   important. As I said, I probably will never read as many research   notes that I've read in the last six months from all of you guys,   apologies to you, but I have a day job. But I did read most of   them, and I did read, but you guys have concerned about, and I   understand why you like those models. But if you got to run the   Company, you'll be the owner [Phonetic] of the Company and the   way the customers want us to deliver the product. So that's   why.",

    "Yes, Carbon Black, yes.",
    " Srini Nandury    --   Summit Insights Group LLC -- Analyst ",
    "Okay. So the question is this, we are trying to make sense of   how the landscape is going to be evolving, It looks like VMware   is going to be acquiring more companies in this space and what   does this mean for the whole security landscape going   forward?",
    " Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ",
    "I can't comment on VMware strategy. There are lot of people   who believe security is important, right? And they're all   stepping up their acquisitions and security. And I think that's   probably accurate. You will see a lot more acquisition in this   space, because I don't think 2,500 vendors are going to survive.   One of the questions early gentlemen asked was buying behavior. I   firmly believe in the next five years, you will see more   consolidated single vendor buys than you will see multi-vendor   buys. 800 EBCs at Palo Alto Networks where customers show up and   I haven't seen a customer who's actually espouses desire that he   wants -- he or she wants multiple vendors to be able to secure   their environment. They're looking for a solution which   integrates across multiple solutions.",
    "So, if any company out there, whether it's VMware, or whether   it's Microsoft, whether it's Broadcom can actually take products   and integrate them. I think they're going to win. So, the   question is not acquiring, we can all acquire companies.   Acquisition is the easiest part. The question is, can you   actually integrate them? Do you actually get leverage from   integrating them into your platform? Acquiring a customer,   putting them in an ELA and making them free or being part of your   large, what is that, I hear that platform level. So there is a   new term you will hear soon in the security space from ELAs to   PLAs because people have disparate products security and   consulting and chips and you could put them into a PLA now, it   does not have to be an ELA anymore because it's more than an Es   to P. But those are interesting parts. I think the true need of   the customer is an integrated platform. So people can deliver   integrated platform more part of them. Again, as Nir just   articulated, you need firewalls and endpoint to be able to work   together to be able to do next-generation security, similarly you   need container serverless public cloud workloads to do it   together.",
    "And I will tell you, the anecdotal and I apologize if it   doesn't apply. When I worked at Google, one of the businesses we   started to go after was display advertising, it has nothing to do   with security. And Google had no horse in the race. They didn't   want a display property. Microsoft had one, Yahoo had one. And   they're both very good at selling their own display properties,   but they were not good at cross market selling because typically   they defaulted their own product.",
    "And my concern is when you start looking at cloud native   players, like AWS or Azure or GCP or VMware with their own sort   of hybrid solutions, you default to better integrations and   better alignment with your core product and you don't do as good   a job of across industry security solution, across industry   products. So, our hope is we'll be the platform of choice across   multiple platforms as opposed to platforms that integrate   security and trying to bundle it when you buy their platform.",
    "So, if I don't want to deploy VMware, would I be deploying   Carbon Black today? I would have. I may have. Tomorrow, I suspect   the integration is going to be stronger. I'm not sure which   strategy gets me more revenue, maybe gets me more revenue given   the scale but I think the long-term outcome is that, you want a   multi-platform solution, which is somewhat platform agnostic. So   it can actually make it work better for you across multiple cloud   platforms.",
    "All right. Last one or two questions. Wow, I want to make sure   you guys don't leave here with questions and answers. Go ahead.   Up front. I'm sure I read about it tomorrow or the next week,   like why didn't they ask the question guys.",

    "We'll do that out in the field not here.",
    " Unidentified Participant ",
    "So we're going to provide value like making it easier and more   effective to do the security or there is a dual-value proposition   that customers must see. I wanted to drill down into sort of the   firewall market overall. Nir presented a really good sort of   rationale why firewalling isn't going to go away. We're still   going to be doing firewalling. But it seems like where we're   going to be doing that firewalling is going to change. So, I   guess, the question I have is, should we expect kind of the   traditional firewalling done from an appliance at the edge of the   network. Is that part of the market going to be stable,   increasing, declining in the midst of a broader kind of   firewalling capability that still grows?",
    " Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ",
    "So, I'll give you some data point and then I'll have our   product leadership answer that. I went back and as part of   preparing for the Analyst Day, I looked at the enterprise IT   spend of the last seven years, right? Because it's typically the   end-of-life for most IT infrastructure between seven to 10   depending on what it is and where you buy it. There is   approximately $1 trillion, $1.2 trillion a year, that's been   spent on enterprise IT. The reason I go to track that is because   I think security is 3% to 8% of that number, right? In financial   services, the government goes to 8% because they're very security   conscious, others go to 3%.",
    "So if you think about it, there is approximately $12 trillion   to $15 trillion of plant out there in enterprises, which is IT   infrastructure plant. I just put a slide up there, which is a   Gartner slide or Goldman Sachs slide, I don't remember those,   Goldman Sachs, maybe it's from this morning, which talks about   the cloud disruption opportunity of $1 trillion in 2023, right?   So, either you're telling me that we're going to stop spending an   enterprise IT and the IT entire is going to go down and all we're   going to do is, we're spending in the cloud. Or are you telling   me, people are still going to spend $1 trillion to it, growing at   3% and a lot of that is still going to go to enterprise IT. So, I   suspect this transition is going to take longer than we think   that people are still going to be spending enterprise IT. Now,   not in the margin, it may be smaller number because people are   shifting to the cloud and what it doing is two things, one, it's   making people reevaluate as I'm going to make that shift to the   cloud, what do I want to buy that allows me that transition, and   that's why one of the large retail as we talked about, they're   going to the cloud. They don't want to just buy hardware   firewalls, they want to make sure they can get VM, so the cloud   instances they can get a cloud-delivered architecture to Prisma   Access.",
    "So the question is, we expect this transition to happen in the   next five to seven years, a lot of it. Do you have products that   satisfy the three use cases? So data center use case, the   transition use case to the cloud and then the new architecture   toward the cloud. So we think that's why the product strategy is   aligned toward this transition. We think that shift is going to   happen. It will happen on a customer-specific basis depending how   ready they are. It will happen on a industry basis. So shows us   on the moving parts, but we think firewalling is around for a   while for the people who are still investing in data centers.",

    "Sure. So from a product perspective, the firewalls get   deployed in lots of different places, they get deployed in the   datacenter, they get deployed at headquarter gateways, regional   sites, branch offices, and the -- some of those use cases are   more attractive to shift the form factor. So, for example,   applications moving to public cloud, the form factor toward would   be software for lots of different technical reasons that are   mostly sort of straightforward to understand why you want to do   that. For example, you can't shift a hardware device to Amazon   and ask them to deploy into your AWS account. You have to use   software form factors.",
    "As we talked about for branch offices, retail, mobile users,   there is a shift that we are driving with Prisma Access that we   believe is a very good shift, both in terms of the customer   outcome, as well as what they need and want to be able to   accomplish. But there is still -- as Nikesh was saying, this   investment in the enterprise infrastructure over the last   seven-plus years, there will continue to be a lot of investment   in that infrastructure has to be protected. So, particularly in   the larger central sites, regional sites and the world will be   hybrid for a long time, meaning datacenters there will still be a   lot of hardware that will need to be deployed against that.",
    "And one thing we didn't talk about today, but it is very   important is, in a lot of those places that I just mentioned, the   performance of hardware starts to become really important, right?   If you think about a large headquarters with 10 gig connectivity   growing, you want to do internal segmentation or do segment of   IoT devices and things like that, which that would be 100 gig,   some of the larger datacenters, hardware still has a very   important role to play in a lot of those core use cases.",
    " Nikesh Arora    --   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ",
    "All right. I think with that we'll call an end to the Q&A   session. I want to say thank you to my management team here, who   has been part of the journey and getting us here so far. I also   want to use the opportunity to shout at our 7,000 employees   around the world who worked hard to deliver the results that we   are able to deliver and hopefully we'll keep working hard for the   next three years to achieve the targets and beyond, to achieve   the targets we've outlined.",
    "With that, it's my pleasure to invite you downstairs for some   cocktails and some demos, instead -- in case you want to geek out   in some of the products.",
