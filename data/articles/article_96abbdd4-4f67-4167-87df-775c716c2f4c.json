  "text": [
    " A month has gone by since the las t earnings  report for Sohu.com (SOHU). Shares have added about 20.7% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500. Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Sohu.com due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recen t earnings report  in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.  Sohu Q2 Loss Flat Year Over Year, Revenues Down  makeArticleAd();  Sohu.com reported second-quarter 2019 non-GAAP loss of $1.27 per share, remaining flat with the year-ago quarter's loss. The reported loss was wider than the higher end of management's guided range of loss of 95 cents and $1.20.    The company reported GAAP loss of $1.35 per share, wider than the year-ago loss of $1.23. However, the figure was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.55.    Revenues of $474.8 million were down 2.3% year over year and came within the guided range of $469-$494 million. Improved performance of the company's online game businesses and cost savings initiatives couldn't mitigate the decline in brand advertising domain.    However, on a constant currency basis, revenues of $507 million represent growth of 4% year over year.    The company's top-line was negatively impacted by a decline in ad spending that can be attributed to overall softness in macroeconomic conditions. Moreover, trade war between the United States and China remains a growth deterrent.    Further, sluggishness in IT and auto industry is keeping management cautious. Efforts to diversify end-markets and explore new growth verticals with increasing spend on product enhancements are likely to weigh on near-term profitability.   Quarter in Detail    Total online advertising revenues (inclusive of revenues from brand advertising, search and search related businesses) declined 3.6% year over year to $319.9 million.    Brand advertising revenues in the reported quarter fell 28.6% on a year-over-year basis to $43.9 million, primarily owing to decrease in video and portal advertising revenues. Search and search-related revenues improved 2.1% year over year to $275.9 million.    Online game revenues of $102.1 million were up 8.4% from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to improvement in performance of \"Changyou's older games\" and positive impact of promotional activities undertaken during the quarter.    Meanwhile, other revenues declined almost 12% year over year to $52.7 million.    Sohu Video non-GAAP revenues were $21 million, down 34% year over year. Notably, video advertising revenues were $8 million in the second quarter.    Sohu Video's loss narrowed due to stringent cost controls. Notably, operating loss was down 34.3% year over year to $23 million. Additionally, Sohu Video showcased appealing content to users in the reported quarter.    Sohu Media Portal non-GAAP revenues were down 27% on a year-over-year basis to $24 million.
