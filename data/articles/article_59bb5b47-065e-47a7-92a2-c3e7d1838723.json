    "The news is \"driving everything at the moment\", said OANDA analyst Jeffrey Halley.",
    "\"Gold will remain under pressure, because trade tensions have been the elephant in the room. Any sign there is a thawing in that situation is going to see a rotation out of gold and into growth-orientated assets.\"",
