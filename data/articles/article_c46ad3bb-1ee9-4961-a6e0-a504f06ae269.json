    " It has been about a month since the las t earnings  report for Energizer Holdings (ENR). Shares have added about 16.5% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500. Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Energizer due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recen t earnings report  in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.  Energizer's Q3 Earnings & Sales Misses Estimates  makeArticleAd();  Energizer Holdings posted dismal third-quarter fiscal 2019 results. We note that both the top line and the bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Although the company's net sales increased year over year, earnings per share fell from the year-ago period. In fact, this marked the second consecutive quarter o f earnings  and sales miss. Also, management lowered its sales view for fiscal year 2019.   Q3 in Detail    Adjusted earnings came in at 37 cents per share, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 47 cents and declined significantly from the year-ago quarter's figure of 54 cents. This was due to the impact of weather on auto refrigerant business and change in the allocation of interest partly offset by better cost efficiencies and synergies. The downside may also be due to increase in cost of goods sold and rise in SG&A expenses.    The company reported net sales of $647.2 million, which fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $675.9 million. Nonetheless, the same soared 64.8% on a year-over-year basis. This increase was driven by contribution from acquired business.    Meanwhile, organic sales improved 3.6% during the quarter. The improvement was buoyed by strength in battery business from distribution gains and better pricing in the third quarter, partially offset by 190 basis points (bps) due to adverse currency fluctuations.

Revenues at the International segment amounted to $182.1 million, mirroring an increase of 20.2% from the year-ago quarter.   Margins    Energizer's adjusted gross margin contracted 480 bps to 40% due to the buyout of lower-margin profile businesses and adverse impact of foreign currency.    SG&A expenses, excluding acquisition and integration costs, amounted to $112.5 million, reflecting an increase of $23 million from the year-ago quarter.
