    "Sept 12 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabian stocks dropped further in early trading on Thursday, after hitting an eight-month low in the last session, with banks weighing most heavily on the index, while other major Gulf markets also traded lower.",
    "The Saudi index  was down 0.3%, down for a third straight session. The market fell as much as 2.5% on Wednesday, wiping out all its gains this year before clawing back some losses to close just 0.4% up year-to-date.",
    "The market is now trading just 0.1% higher for the year. It jumped as much as 20% between January and May, led by foreign investors who have been net buyers every month this year as Saudi stocks joined the MSCI and FTSE Russell emerging market indexes.",
    "Petrochemical maker Saudi Basic Industries  shed 1.2% and Riyad Bank  dropped 1.6%.",
    "Qatar's index  fell 0.3%, snapping a four-session winning streak, with Industries Qatar  slipping 0.8% and lender Masraf Al Rayan  trading 0.7% lower.",

    "Dubai's index  slipped 0.1% with most property stocks drifting into negative territory. Emaar Malls  slipped 1.6% while blue-chip developer Emaar Properties  inched down 0.2%.",
    "Dubai property prices have tumbled 25-35% since mid-2014 and are expected to decline further this year and next amid a slowing economy and due to an oversupply of housing units. "
