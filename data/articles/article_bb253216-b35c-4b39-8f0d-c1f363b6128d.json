Moreover, revenues have been increasing consistently since 2010 (except in 2015, which saw a revenue dip of just 0.4%). This trend continued into 2018 and the first half of 2019, led by strong segmental growth, acquisitions and penetration into new areas, etc. A number of acquisitions made over the past many years, significant capital expenditures undertaken for growth, launch of new product and services, enhancements of digital capabilities and branching out into new businesses will further boost the company's growth.
