  "text": [
    " Shares of Franco-Nevada Corporation FNV  scaled a fresh 52-week high of $101.19 on Sep 4, before eventually closing at $98.82. The company has a market cap of roughly $18.9 billion. Average volume of shares traded in the past three months was around 581.39K.      The stock has gained 43.8% in the past year compared with the industry  's rally of 55.8%.  What's Driving the Rally?  Robust second-quarter results, upbeat outlook for revenues from its energy assets and higher  gold prices  so far this year have contributed to Franco-Nevada's shares.  Franco-Nevada Corporation Price         Franco-Nevada Corporation price    |   Franco-Nevada Corporation Quote makeArticleAd();     The company delivered stellar earnings results for the June-end   quarter. I   t report    ed adjusted earnings of $64 million or 34 cents per share, up   from the prior-year quarter's $53.7 million or 29 cents per   share. In addition, earnings per share figure surpassed the Zacks   Consensus Estimate of 31 cents.        Moreover, the company generated revenues of $170.5 million in the   reported quarter, reflecting year-over-year improvement of   5.7%. The company now expects to generate $100-$115 million in   revenues from energy assets compared with the prior estimate of   $70-$85 million, driven by the Marcellus royalty acquisition and   stellar performance of energy assets. With the continued   development of its U.S. oil & gas assets, the company   forecasts energy assets to contribute 16-17% of revenues by   2023. Franco-Nevada has completed its $1-billion commitment for the   Cobre Panama project. In July, Cobre Panama commenced production   of initial gold and silver stream and is likely to produce   140,000-175,000 tons of copper in the current year. Further, the   project is anticipated to be a major growth driver for the second   half of this year. For 2019, the company estimates to produce   upper end of the prior guidance of 20,000-40,000 ounces gold from   the project. Franco-Nevada expects Gold Equivalent Ounces (GEOs) to be at   the upper end of the previously-issued guidance of   465,000-500,000 GEOs, driven by strong results so far, and   increase in expected deliveries from the project. Moreover, gold prices have been currently trending above   $1,500 an ounce - levels last seen in 2013. The prolonged trade   war, current slowdown in manufacturing activity and a weaker   dollar have collectively helped lift the yellow metal's   investment appeal. The combination of lower mined gold supply and   higher demand, and geopolitical tensions could eventually drive   prices north. Moreover, anticipation for rate cuts work in gold's   favor. This has also fueled the appreciation in Franco-Nevada's   share price. Earnings estimates for Franco-Nevada for 2019 and fiscal 2020   have moved up 20% and 22% respectively over the past 30 days.
