    " Shares of video game giant   Activision Blizzard    (NASDAQ: ATVI) have crashed over the past year, but the former   growth stock    made up some of that lost ground on Wednesday thanks to an   analyst upgrade. The stock had gained about 4.6% by 2 p.m.   EDT. Analyst Gerrick Johnson at BMO Capital Markets upped his   rating on Activision to outperform and raised his price target on   the video game stock from $43 to $60. The upgrade was driven by a   few factors, including the popularity of   World of Warcraft Classic    , a rerelease of the original version of the popular   subscription-based game. Johnson raised his outlook for   World of Warcraft    subscribers from 3 million to 5.4 million for 2020.   Image source: Activision Blizzard.makeArticleAd();  Other catalysts Johnson pointed out include cost savings,   related to recently announced layoffs, that can be invested in   growth areas like e-sports; a rebound for the company's   Hearthstone    online card game; a deep catalog of classic games that could be   remastered; and the potential for the popularity of   Fortnite    , developed by privately held Epic Games, to fade.  Activision's recent results have been   lackluster    -- second-quarter revenue tumbled nearly 15%, and earnings per   share dropped more than 17%. The company is investing in its   flagship franchises, which will take time to pay off. The   Call of Duty    franchise will get a new game in October, along with a mobile   version, and the company announced in June that it's sold eight   franchise slots for its upcoming   Call of Duty    global league. While there are plenty of reasons to be bullish on Activision   in the long run, 2019 will be a rough year for the company.   Activision's guidance calls for revenue to tumble 17.5% from   2018, and for adjusted EPS to contract by 25.7%.   10 stocks we like better than Activision     Blizzard       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,     Motley Fool Stock Advisor      , has quadrupled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the     ten best stocks      for investors to buy right now... and Activision Blizzard     wasn't one of them!
