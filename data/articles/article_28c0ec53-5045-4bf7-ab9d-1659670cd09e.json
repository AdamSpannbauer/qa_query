    "DOHA, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Qatar's cabinet has passed a new law to combat money laundering and terrorism financing that will bring it in line with recommendations from the international organisation that sets global standards, its central bank said.",
    "Qatar has been keen to show it is cracking down on terrorism financing, more than two years after coming under embargo by a Saudi-led bloc that has accused it of supporting militant groups, which Doha denies.",
    "The world's biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas has since signed a memorandum of understanding with the United States to increase cooperation on combating terrorism financing.",
    "\"The new law sets out binding legal requirements for business and financial sectors related to combating money laundering and terrorist financing, including non-profit organisations and money transfer services,\" a central bank statement said.",
    "It prescribes \"severe penalties\" including financial sanctions and imprisonment for anyone convicted of violating the law, and calls for the \"widest possible cooperation and exchange of financial information\" with foreign counterparts, it added."
