  "text": [
    " Placing bets on mid-cap stocks is often considered a discreet portfolio diversification strategy. These stocks with a market capitalization of $1-$5 billion integrate lucrative prospects of both small and large-cap stocks. The mid-cap stocks, although less stable than the large-cap ones, offer higher returns. Moreover, these are more mature businesses and are less risk-prone or volatile than the small-cap ones. Given the uncertainty in the market due to the US-China trade tension, decelerating global economy and geopolitical turbulences, investment in mid-cap stocks should be wisely executed in our opinion. \u00a0These stocks are less vulnerable to losses in case the trade deal falls flat as the penetration level is slim in the  global market  s. Notably, mid-cap stocks have surged so far this year. While the S&P 400 Mid-cap Index (SP400) has returned 9.4% year to date.  Technology's Impact Inimitable  Technology has been one of the most bankable sectors for investors despite the current macroeconomic challenges it is subjected to. Notably, the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) has gained 28.9% on a year-to-date basis compared with the S&P 500's rally of roughly 14.5%. Rapid adoption of AI, cloud computing, IoT, autonomous vehicles and wearables has been fueling growth for the sector. Moreover, increasing video streaming, growing demand for smart speakers and connected devices powered by AI, machine learning and deep learning, are key catalysts. Additionally, the accelerated deployment of 5G technology and faster-than-expected growth in robotics set the stage for more development. Although the aforementioned factors look promising for the sector, the unstable macroeconomic scenario is quite an eyesore. Notably, the semiconductor industry, which forms the fulcrum of the tech sector, is caught in a volatile geopolitical situation stemming from the trade and tariff dispute as well as economic weakness in China. Nonetheless, the much-anticipated growth revival in the second half of the current year is raising investor's optimism.
