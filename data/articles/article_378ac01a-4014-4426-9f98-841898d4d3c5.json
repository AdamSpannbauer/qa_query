    " What happened Shares of   GW Pharmaceuticals    (NASDAQ: GWPH) dropped 12.2% in August, according to data   provided by      S&P Global Market Intelligence,    after the company posted fairly solid   second-quarter results    . So what Sales of Epidiolex, a cannabidiol (CBD) drug derived from   marijuana, more than doubled from the first quarter to the second   quarter with over 12,000 patients having received the drug and a   \"vast majority\" remaining on the therapy, according to the   company. On the bottom line, GW Pharmaceuticals posted a profit of   $0.21 per share, although that was entirely due to selling a Rare   Pediatric Priority Review Voucher. If a company doesn't need the   voucher, which can be turned in for a faster FDA review, it can   be sold -- as GW Pharmaceuticals did for a little over $104   million.makeArticleAd(); The company's operating loss improved to $29.3 million from   $81.4 million in the year-ago quarter. Overall, this seems to be a sell-the-news issue for the   cannabis-focused biotech    . It took about a week to erase the post-earnings gains, and then   it was downhill from there. The fact that GW Pharmaceuticals was   one of the   best-performing cannabis stocks on the market so   far in 2019    probably contributed to the decline. Even after the rough month,   it's still up over 45% for the year.   Image source: Getty Images.
