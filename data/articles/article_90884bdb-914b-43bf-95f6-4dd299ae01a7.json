    "Overview:\u00a0\u00a0A showdown between UK Prime Minister Johnson and Parliament over Brexit pushed sterling below $1.20.\u00a0 The euro is extended its losses after finishing last week below $1.10.\u00a0 Growth concerns are seeing equities retreat.\u00a0 Japanese and Chinese shares managed to eke out gains, but the Asia Pacific and European stocks have been sold.\u00a0 The Dow Jones Stoxx 600 has been turned back from key target reached yesterday and is snapping a three-day advance today.\u00a0 US shares are trading heavily in Europe, and the S&P 500 may open more than 0.8% lower.\u00a0 Benchmark 10-year yields are falling three-six basis points today, with some European bonds, like Germany, Netherlands, and Italy falling to new record lows.\u00a0 The dollar is broadly higher against most major and emerging market currencies.\u00a0 Although the Swiss National Bank does not appear to have intervened last week, the franc's safe-haven status pales compared with the Japanese yen. The yen is posting minor gains today, and the Australian dollar is also resisting greenback strength following news of its first current account surplus in a generation.\u00a0 Among emerging markets, the lower than expected CPI is spurring talk that Turkey has scope to cut rates again next week, and this is seeing some demand for the lira.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0",
    "Asia Pacific",
    "China continues to resist pressure on the yuan.\u00a0\u00a0The PBOC's dollar reference rate was set at CNY7.0884 vs. CNY7.0883 on Monday.\u00a0 Bank models had it closer to CNY7.1040.\u00a0 The dollar approached CNH7.1965, but participants pulled back from testing CNH7.20 for fear of triggering a more aggressive response by officials.\u00a0 Some are rolling positions into options, favoring CNH7.25 and CNH7.35 strikes.\u00a0 A couple of large US banks are forecasting CNY7.50 by year-end.\u00a0",
    "The Reserve Bank of Australia as widely expected left the cash rate at 1.0% today.\u00a0 Many expect a rate cut in Q4 19 and another in Q1 19.\u00a0 \u00a0Separately, Australia reported a decline in July retail sales and its first quarterly current account surplus in nearly 45 years.\u00a0 \u00a0Retail sales fell 0.1%.\u00a0 The median forecast was for a 0.2% gain after a 0.4% rise in June.\u00a0 Australia recorded an A$5.9 bln current account surplus in Q2, which was nearly four times larger than expected.\u00a0 The Q1 deficit was revised from a nearly A$3 bln deficit to an A$1.1 bln shortfall.\u00a0",
    "South Korea shaved its Q2 GDP to 1.0% from 1.1% and reported half the gain expected in August CPI, pushing the year-over-year rate to zero.\u00a0\u00a0In July it was at 0.6%.\u00a0 The base effect with a 0.2% month-over-month rise weighed on the measure.\u00a0 The core rate slipped to 0.9% from 1.0%.\u00a0 The central bank does not meet until the middle of next month.\u00a0 Its key policy rate (seven-day repo) is at 1.5%.\u00a0 The July cut unwound the hike from last November.\u00a0 Another cut looks likely.\u00a0\u00a0",
    "The dollar has been confined to yesterday's range against the yen (~JPY105.90-JPY106.40).\u00a0 There are $1.3 bln in expiring options struck at JPY106.15-JPY106.20.\u00a0 The greenback's lows were recorded in the European morning, and the intraday technicals suggest scope for a recovery in the North American morning.\u00a0\u00a0The Australian dollar slipped through $0.6700 but recovered and now faces resistance in the $0.6735-$0.6740 area.\u00a0 Here the intraday technical readings warn that the cap may hold.\u00a0 Indian stocks came under pressure following disappointing GDP figures last week, and the rupee is making new lows for the year against the dollar.\u00a0\u00a0",
    "Europe",
    "The battle lines are drawn in the UK.\u00a0 \u00a0The House of Commons will consider a bill to request a three-month delay of Brexit if a deal is not agreed upon by mid-October.\u00a0 Prime Minister Johnson recognizes this as an attempt to prevent a no-deal Brexit.\u00a0 Johnson says the EU will capitulate when it sees that nothing will stop the UK from leaving at the end of next month.\u00a0 However, thus far, the EC has shown no real signs of wavering.\u00a0 Johnson threatens that if the government loses today's vote, tomorrow he will call a snap election (October 14).\u00a0\u00a0However, the rub is that it is no longer within the PM's power to call an election and he would need 2/3 of the House of Commons or 434 votes to do so.\u00a0 The Tories have 311 MPs assuming none are forced out of the party as Johnson has threatened over today's vote.\u00a0\u00a0",
    "Italy's political storm, triggered by the League's withdrawal of from the government, maybe nearly over.\u00a0\u00a0Prime Minister Conte may have succeeded in forging a new coalition.\u00a0 This one, between the Five Star Movement and the Democrat Party, seems almost as unwieldy as the last one, but their common hostility to Salvini may be sufficient allow the country to move forward on the 2020 budget and some political reforms.\u00a0 With a little bit of luck, the worst economic news may be behind it.\u00a0 Tomorrow, Italy reports the August composite PMI.\u00a0 It may have slipped after rising to 51.0 in July from, its third monthly increase.\u00a0 The composite bottomed last October-November at 49.3.\u00a0 It was still below the 50 boom/bust level in May.\u00a0",
    "Turkey reported a larger than expected decline in inflation, and this is fueling expectations for another large rate cut.\u00a0 August CPI fell to 15.01% from 16.65% in July.\u00a0 The core rate fell to 13.6% from 16.2%.\u00a0 The one-week repo rate stands at 19.75% following the 425 bp cut in July.\u00a0 The base effect suggests further declines are likely in the coming months.\u00a0 The central bank projects it will end the year a little below 14%, but this may be a conservative estimate.\u00a0 The central bank meets on September 12, and a 200-300 bp rate cut is possible.\u00a0\u00a0",
    "The euro closed last week below $1.10 and has been unable to resurface above there yesterday or today.\u00a0 It fell to almost $1.0930 in Asia before steadying and reached $1.0950 in the European morning.\u00a0 There are nearly two bln euros in options struck at $1.0945-$1.0950 that will expire later today but are very much in play now.\u00a0 The $1.10 level has a 2.3 bln euro option strike that also will be cut,, though it seems safe.\u00a0 The break of $1.10 suggests the next target is near $1.08.\u00a0 There is a gap from April 2017 that is bound between roughly $1.0780 and $1.0820 that may attract prices.\u00a0 Sterling has been battered through $1.20.\u00a0 The next target is the flash crash low from October 2016, for which there is some disagreement on the exact level it reached.\u00a0 Bloomberg has it near $1.1840.\u00a0 There is an option for GBP270 mln at $1.20 that expires today.\u00a0\u00a0",
    "America",
    "The US reports the August manufacturing PMI and ISM today alongside July construction spending.\u00a0\u00a0While there may be some headline risk, the focus is on tomorrow's auto sales report and Fed's Beige Book, followed by the employment data at the end of the week.\u00a0 The market has no doubt that the Fed will deliver its second rate cut of the year at the conclusion of its meeting on September 18.\u00a0 However, CME's model suggests less than a 3% chance of a 50 bp, while the Bloomberg model puts it at a nearly 20% chance.\u00a0 Subjectively, we suspect there is little chance of a 50 bp move, given the Fed's rhetoric and the still above-trend growth, full employment, and some acceleration in prices recently.\u00a0 There are at least seven Fed officials speaking in the coming days, beginning with Rosengren, one of two dissents from the decision to cut rates in July, and ending with a speech by Powell in Switzerland ahead of the weekend.\u00a0",
    "Canada reports August manufacturing PMI today, but the focus is on tomorrow Bank of Canada meeting.\u00a0 The cash rate is expected to remain steady at 1.75%, but speculation has mounted in recent weeks for an October 30 cut (~55% chance appears discounted in the derivatives market).\u00a0 To validate the speculation, the Bank of Canada will have to soften its neutral stance.\u00a0 \u00a0Canada also reports its August employment data ahead of the weekend, and a bounce back after a soft July is anticipated.\u00a0 Canada's national election will be held on October 21.\u00a0\u00a0",
    "The US dollar is looking to extend its seven-week rally against the Canadian dollar.\u00a0 It rose in quiet trade yesterday and is rising further today.\u00a0 Indeed, the greenback is at its best level since mid-June today near CAD1.3365.\u00a0 This area corresponds to a retracement objective and suggests the next target is in the CAD1.3400-CAD1.3435 area.\u00a0 Support now is seen in the CAD1.3315 area.\u00a0 Mexico has a light calendar this week.\u00a0 The dollar has risen against the peso for the past seven weeks as well.\u00a0 Yesterday and so far today it is trading within the range seen before the weekend of roughly MXN20.00-MXN20.20.\u00a0 Today bids are being found near the midpoint of the range.\u00a0 The high from last December was set near MXN20.65.\u00a0 The Dollar Index rose 1.3% last week, the most in since mid-June 2018.\u00a0 It tested 99.00 ahead of the weekend and is now near 99.35.\u00a0 The next target is 100.00-100.15.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0",
