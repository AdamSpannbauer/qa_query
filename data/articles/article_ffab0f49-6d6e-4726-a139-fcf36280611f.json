    "In this series, we look through the most recent Dividend Channel ''DividendRank''  report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money - maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both. So when stocks turn up that see insider buying, and are also top ranked, investors are wise to take notice. One such company is Magellan Midstream Partners LP (Symbol: MMP), which saw buying by Director Chansoo Joung.      Back on August 20, Joung invested $336,414.00 into 5,000 shares of MMP, for a cost per share of $67.28.
