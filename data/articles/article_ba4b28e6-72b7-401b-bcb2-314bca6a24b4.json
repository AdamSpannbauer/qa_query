    "How to defend against this tough equity market? Some say to     buy defensive sectors like healthcare and consumer staples.     Others buy gold. Ironically, however, the best protection may     be to stick with the old 60/40 balanced portfolio. Despite all     the market turmoil recently, if you had been holding a 60% SPY     and 40% AGG portfolio over the last month you would have had a     net return of negative 0.62%, which is pretty good considering     how ugly markets were. If you had been holding it for the whole     year, you would have a sterling return of 14.45%.",
