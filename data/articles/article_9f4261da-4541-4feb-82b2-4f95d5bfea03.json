Adjusted operating income in the reported quarter declined 4.3% year over year to $95.3 million. Notably, fall in adjusted operating income was due to impacts of simplification/modernization actions, forex woes and lower absorption of costs (including fixed and volume-related labor costs) in some facilities.
