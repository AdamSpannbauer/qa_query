Amazon    (NASDAQ: AMZN) dominated with its Amazon Web Services while   Alphabet's    (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) \u00a0Google was its scrappy   second-place rival. But things have changed a lot since then. Amazon is still the   leader, but Microsoft is chipping away at its lead. It has become   the second-largest cloud computing provider on a worldwide basis   and is growing at a rate that surpasses its rivals.

It has been pouring billions   of dollars into the efforts. Today it is among the few cloud   computing players that cover all the aspects of the marketplace.
