  "text": [
    "  WW    (NASDAQ: WW) , formerly known as Weight Watchers International,   reported strong second-quarter results Aug. 7, sending the   stock soaring nearly 43%    . An improvement in member recruitment trends prompted the   company to raise its fiscal-year 2019 guidance. Total subscribers   increased to 4.6 million, the highest level ever for a second   quarter. WW is seeking to capitalize on a global wellness revolution   that has ignited a healthcare growth market in recent years.   According to the Global Wellness Institute, the wellness market   is growing at nearly twice the rate of the overall global   economy. Here in the U.S., Americans are more focused on healthy   eating, fitness, and disease prevention than ever before.   Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();  Employers are also embracing the wellness craze. Companies   responsible for employee health plan coverage have changed their   perception of insurance, now seeing it as a way to keep employees   healthy and productive rather than as a (necessary) cost burden.   As a result, nutrition and other wellness areas now have   increased relevance for health plans. Health plan providers   seeking to lower medical costs are asking for more well-rounded   solutions, by offering employees access to healthy lifestyle   companies like WW. Another company that serves this need is   Tivity Health    (NASDAQ: TVTY) . Tivity Health is the nation's leading provider of fitness and   health improvement programs and is a major player in the wellness   industry. The healthcare side of the business is solid, anchored   by its crown jewel, the Silver Sneakers program for seniors,   along with Prime Fitness for active adults. It is now also in the   nutrition business, going head-to-head with WW after its   Nutrisystem acquisition    \u00a0in December 2018, which it bought for $1.4 billion. This   deal gave Tivity two household names: the legacy Nutrisystem   brand and the South Beach Diet. Heavy demand: Weight loss market has room to grow The weight management market is full of companies offering a   variety of diet plans, promises, and gimmicks, but WW and   Nutrisystem are the established No. 1 and No. 2, respectively.   Can both companies be successful in a crowded market? That market's sheer size supports the idea that there's plenty   of room for multiple winners. In the past 35 years, obesity rates   in the U.S. have more than doubled among adults, according to the   National Center for Health Statistics. Tivity Health estimates   that about 133 million people nationwide are trying to lose   weight or actively prevent weight gain. WW and Nutrisystem's   membership numbers combined add up to less than 10 million, which   suggests that both companies have plenty of room to grow and that   both are likely to benefit from this secular growth market. While both WW and Nutrisystem are weight loss specialists at   the core, their brands have distinct differences that appeal to   different customers. WW's business model involves weekly meetings   with group support about healthy eating programs, behavior   modification, and physical fitness. Its traditional   point-counting system is helpful to some but viewed as cumbersome   by others, and the cost of food is a separate charge with WW   plans. Nutrisystem uses data analytics to offer personalized   nutrition solutions. Its auto-delivery meal plans start at $10   per day and includes comprehensive counseling add-ons such as   access to trained weight loss coaches and certified diabetes   instructors. It does not use a point-counting system, and the   cost of food is included. While there are differentiators, both   companies seek loyal customer engagement and both can thrive in   the current wellness environment. Biggest loser to big winner: Tivity Health on the comeback   trail Like WW, Tivity Health has embarked on a turnaround journey.   While the company posted good results in its   most recent quarter    that included $1.3 million in Nutrisystem cost synergies, the   market has been skeptical of its ability to successfully   integrate and expand Nutrisystem. According to the company's   conference call with investors, Tivity's total revenue for the   second quarter was $340.4 million, an increase of 124% over the   same period last year. Its net income was $18.1 million compared   to income from continuing operations of $22.7 million in the   second quarter of last year. However, the combination of the healthcare business with   Nutrisystem has created a high degree of complementary products   and services. Tivity Health has access to the major health   insurance companies, a group generally associated with high entry   barriers. This represents a tremendous cross-selling opportunity   and an advantage over WW and other nutrition companies. It can   now offer Nutrisystem diet plans and products to its Silver   Sneakers and Prime Fitness participants in its 16,000 fitness   centers nationwide. Tivity Health has much to prove, but management has already   taken some positive steps to improve the nutrition business.   Revenue synergies have resulted from strong early demand from   insurance carriers for its integrated offering which includes   physical activity and nutrition. The company also secured two   contract wins in the second quarter that combines fitness and   nutrition solutions for hospital patients after discharge and in   recovery. Tivity looks undervalued at current levels, in large part   because of the underappreciated synergistic potential of   Nutrisystem. At 14 times forward earnings, it currently trades at   roughly half its historical multiple. As health-focused Americans   turn to weight loss solutions including WW and Nutrisystem,   shrinking waistlines could mean expanding company profits and   shareholder gains.  10 stocks we like better than Weight Watchers   International     When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,   it can pay to listen.
