  "text": [
    "  IMAX Corporation  's IMAX  subsidiary IMAX China recently stated that the company collected box office gross of RMB250 million in August from IMAX theaters across Greater China.  makeArticleAd();  IMAX noted that this is one of its best monthly performances, driven by blockbuster Hollywood and Chinese language titles including Ne Zha, Fast and Furious Presents: Hobbs and Shaw, The Bravest, Spider-man: Far from Home  and The Lion King  .    Notably, as of Aug 31, IMAX China grossed RMB 2.1 billion in box office, up 28% compared to the same period last year.   Hollywood & Chinese Content Strength Aids Growth    Apart from blockbuster Hollywood titles, IMAX is also benefiting from Chinese language releases. The release of Chinese content in smaller cities boosted its local box office revenues.    In August, per management, Ne Zha  , became the first Chinese animated fantasy to be released in IMAX. It was released in China and select 3D IMAX theaters across North America and UK.    According to a Forbes  report, Ne Zha  became the second-biggest grosser in China after Wolf Warrior 2  ($854 million) as it outnumbered the box office figure of The Wandering Earth  ($691 million) in China. The film is expected to earn around $1.43 million over the weekend, leading to per theater average of $20,399 over the first five days.    Other Chinese titles released on IMAX in 2019 so far include Looking Up, The Bravest  and Shanghai Fortress  .    For the rest of 2019, management anticipates box office to grow in low double digits internationally compared with the earlier guidance of mid-to-high single-digit range.
