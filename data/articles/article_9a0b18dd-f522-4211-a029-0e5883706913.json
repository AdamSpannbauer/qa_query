    "Investors considering a purchase of Coca-Cola Co (Symbol: KO) stock, but cautious about paying the going market price of $54.43/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2021 put at the $38 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of 74 cents. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 1.9% return against the $38 commitment, or a 1.4% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost  ).      Selling a put does not give an investor access to KO's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $38 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. ( Do options carry counterparty risk? This and six other common options myths debunked  ). So unless Coca-Cola Co sees its shares decline 30% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $37.26 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the 74 cents from $38), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 1.4% annualized rate of return.  makeArticleAd();  Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Coca-Cola Co , and highlighting in green where the $38 strike is located relative to that history:       The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2021 put at the $38 strike for the 1.4% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Coca-Cola Co (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $54.43) to be 18%.
