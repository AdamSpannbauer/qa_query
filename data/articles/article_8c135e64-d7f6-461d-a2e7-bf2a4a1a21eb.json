  "title": "Illinois Jumps on Bandwagon to Block T-Mobile and Sprint's Merger - Nasdaq.com",
  "text": [
    " Over the summer, numerous state attorneys general joined   forces to file a lawsuit   seeking to block T-Mobile    's (NASDAQ: TMUS) proposed megamerger with smaller rival   Sprint    (NYSE: S) , a $26 billion deal that would reshape the U.S.   wireless industry, a favorite among   dividend investors    . Additional states promptly   piled on    , with more joining the effort opposing the deal in the months   since. The states argue that the merger would hurt competition   and eventually lead to higher prices for consumers. Illinois has now jumped on the bandwagon, too.   Sprint Executive Chairman Marcelo Claure and T-Mobile CEO     John Legere. Image source: T-Mobile.makeArticleAd();  Over half of the U.S. population is represented New York Attorney General Letitia James announced\u00a0the   latest addition this morning, noting that Illinois Attorney   General Kwame Raoul will become the 17th state prosecutor to join   the suit. That means a full third of state attorneys general in   the U.S. (when including the District of Columbia), which James   notes represent over half of the U.S. population, are now   attempting to block the deal. The attorneys general now included in the lawsuit represent   California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland,   Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nevada, New   York, Oregon, Texas, Virginia, Wisconsin, and the District of   Columbia. \"This merger would significantly decrease competition for   mobile wireless telecommunications services in Illinois and   across the country,\" Raoul said in a statement. \"With fewer   companies competing, customers would face fewer choices, higher   prices, less innovation and lower quality service.\" The   prosecutors note that Illinois includes the third-most-populous   city in the U.S. (Chicago) and is an important hub for the   industrial, agricultural, and transportation sectors, which makes   it \"highly susceptible\" to competitive harm. So much for closing in 2019 T-Mobile and Sprint   scored merger approval    from the Department of Justice in late July, a settlement that   required the combined company to spin off certain prepaid   subsidiaries in addition to wireless spectrum. The idea is to enable a new fourth wireless carrier --   DISH Network    -- to be created in order to preserve competition, although   critics such as the attorneys general question the viability of   the proposal since DISH has no meaningful experience in deploying   a cellular network nationally. It's worth noting that   five\u00a0of the states that are currently still part of the   lawsuit (Nebraska, Kansas, Ohio, Oklahoma, and South Dakota) have   signed on to the proposed settlement. The states won a delay\u00a0last month that pushed the trial   to Dec. 9, with the attorneys general arguing they needed more   time to investigate. T-Mobile had previously hoped\u00a0to secure   all of the necessary approvals in order to close the deal by the   year's end, but that timeline now seems unlikely. \"We believe the plaintiffs' claims are without merit, and we   intend to defend the lawsuit vigorously,\" T-Mobile wrote in its   most recent 10-Q.   10 stocks we like better than T-Mobile US       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.
