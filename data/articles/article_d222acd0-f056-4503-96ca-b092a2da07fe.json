    "(Washington)",
    "Whichever side of the political aisle you are on, the new polls coming out about the 2020 presidential election look misleading. A new Gallup poll released this week showed that Biden has a 54% to 38% lead over Trump. Furthermore, the poll found that any of the 5 top Democratic contenders would beat Trump in the election were they to win the bid. Additionally, 37% of voters reported that they felt the economy was worsening versus 31% who said it was improving, the first time recently that Americans have been pessimistic about the economic outlook.",
    "FINSUM : The polls don't seem to be doing justice to how close this election feels. They just don't reconcile for us. That said, the numbers on economic sentiment are quite interesting.",
