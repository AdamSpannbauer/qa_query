    "TOKYO, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Asian shares extended gains on Thursday and U.S. stock futures jumped after China said it will hold trade talks with the United States in early October, raising hopes they can de-escalate their trade war before it inflicts further damage on the global economy.",

    "China'sCommerce Ministry said its trade team will consult with their U.S. counterparts in mid-September in preparation for negotiations in early October, hinting at progress in reducing trade friction.",

    "\"Since yesterday, there has been limited downside in markets because of what happened in Hong Kong, but now the U.S.-China talks are the story,\" said Masayuki Kichikawa, chief macro strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management Co in Tokyo.",
    "\"It's the same about Brexit, which means less downside risk.\"",

    "In currency markets, sterling held onto gains against the dollar in Asia after rallying the most in more than five months on Wednesday after lawmakers voted to prevent Prime Minister Boris Johnson taking Britain out of the European Union without a deal on Oct. 31.",
    "But, more than three years since the United Kingdom voted narrowly to leave the EU, the outcome of Brexit is still unclear, with possible outcomes ranging from a crash out of the EU to abandoning the whole endeavour.",
    "Against the offshore yuan, the dollar fell 0.2% to 7.1324 yuan.",
    "U.S. Treasury yields extended gains in Asia and the yield curve steepened, both signs that investors were willing to take on riskier assets.",
    "The 10-year yield  rose to 1.4758%, while two-year yields  rose to 1.4519%.",
    "The spread between two- and 10-year Treasury yields , the most commonly used measure of the yield curve, rose to its highest since Aug. 21 on Wednesday but narrowed slightly in Asian trade.",
