  "text": [
    "Per Trefis estimates, Facebook ( FB  ) could potentially pay around $5.8 billion to acquire\u00a0Yelp\u00a0( YELP  ) (a figure more than double its current market cap), and still be able to accrue billions of dollars in value for its own shareholders. We detail the rationale behind  Facebook potentially acquiring Yelp   in an interactive dashboard, along with our workings for the estimated acquisition price.\u00a0Our estimate is based on the Yelp's intrinsic value and the value of revenue and cost synergies from an acquisition. Considering Yelp is much smaller than Facebook, most of the synergies are likely to arise from Yelp getting access to a larger user base at superior unit economics (EBITDA / user).",

    " * Note : In its SEC filings, Yelp discloses that \"App users   generate a substantial majority of activity on Yelp,\" which is   why we use the number of disclosed App users to determine the   ARPU. While Yelp generates a small portion of its revenues from   unregistered users accessing its webpage through mobiles or   desktops, we believe that a combined figure for total users   (adjusted for duplication) is not representative of   revenue-driving active users , and will dilute the ARPU figure   considerably.
