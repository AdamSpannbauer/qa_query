    " Nevada has been one of the   hottest    markets for cannabis in the entire country. Sales in excess of   $50 million have been the norm for the state, and one company   that has been a dominant force there is   Planet 13 Holdings    (OTC: PLNHF) . Last week, the cannabis producer released its   quarterly earnings, which continued to show strong growth. During the past three months, the company has generated $16.5   million in sales, which is 9.5% of the $174.6 million that the   state has generated in cannabis revenue during that same period.   Planet 13's dominance in the state has been rising in recent   months:  makeArticleAd();     Data Source:     Planet 13    Why Planet 13 has been so dominant  Unlike many other cannabis producers that have been looking to   expand into as many areas as possible as quickly as possible,   Planet 13 has taken a more focused approach, aiming to make its   SuperStore in Nevada a premier cannabis location. In the earnings   release, the company's co-CEO, Larry Scheffler, highlighted some   of the things consumers can expect:  Our Phase II expansion is progressing at full speed with the     goal of opening at the end of Q3. Phase II which includes a     15,000 sq. ft. customer facing production facility, a     restaurant, a coffee shop, and event space will build on Planet     13's leading position in Las Vegas by creating an experience no     other dispensary can offer.    IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.  Planet 13's vision is to differentiate itself from rivals by   creating much more than just a dispensary. Tourism has been a big   part of the company's success, with Scheffler noting that close   to 80% of the store's visitors have come from outside the   state.  Numbers are getting stronger all around  One of the benefits of the company's measured growth strategy   is that unlike rival cannabis companies that have been very   aggressive in their expansion, Planet 13 doesn't have to try and   manage many different locations across the country and can   instead focus on its SuperStore location and making it as   efficient and cost-effective as possible. This has helped it to   keep its costs under control and not incur significant losses.   While it's great to see that revenues have nearly quadrupled from   $4.4 million to $16.5 million, what's even better is that the   company has been able to achieve those results while also posting   a stronger bottom line. In Q2, Planet 13's net loss of $1 million   was a significant improvement over the $6.9 million loss it   incurred a year ago. Adjusted   EBITDA    of $2.7 million was also significantly higher from $505,000 a   year ago.  Great news for investors  Planet 13's stock has risen 65% through the first eight months   of 2019, and it could have even more room to run given these   strong results. There are many reasons to be excited about where   the company is headed, especially as it looks not only to expand   its SuperStore location but to expand into   California    as well. Earlier this year, Planet 13 announced it had acquired a   dispensary in Santa Ana that like\u00a0the Las Vegas location,   will attract many tourists, being strategically located near   Disneyland. The 40,000 square foot location is expected to be one   of the largest dispensaries in the world.       Here's The Marijuana Stock You've Been Waiting For            A little-known Canadian company just unlocked what some experts     think could be the key to profiting off the coming marijuana     boom.         And make no mistake - it is coming. Cannabis legalization is sweeping over North America - 10     states plus Washington, D.C., have all legalized recreational     marijuana over the last few years, and full legalization came     to Canada in October 2018. And one under-the-radar Canadian company is poised to     explode from this coming marijuana revolution.
