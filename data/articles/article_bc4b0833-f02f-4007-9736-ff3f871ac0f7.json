    "[Editor's Note: This article is updated each week with the latest insider moves.]",
    "I have learned that a simple, yet effective way to find stocks to buy is to look for companies with insider buying. This is especially the case if the stock has recently moved downwards in price.",
    "Insiders are people who have access to confidential information about a company. When they buy or sell their company's stock, the need to make a public filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This is intended to prevent insiders from taking advantage of information that the public does not have access to. For example, if an insider has information that a news story which will drive the stock price higher is about to be released, they could buy it from shareholders that don't know the news.",
    "Because of this we can find out when insiders are buying or selling their stock.",
    "There are many reasons why they may sell. Maybe they need to raise money to buy a house or to pay for their kids' braces.",
    "However, there is only one reason why an insider will buy the stock. They believe that it is currently undervalued. They buy it because they believe that it will eventually trade higher and they will profit.",
