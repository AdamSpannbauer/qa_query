    "  For Immediate Release  Chicago, IL - September 11, 2019 - Stocks in this week's article are DaVita Inc. DVA  , Hibbett Sports, Inc. HIBB  , First Horizon National Corp. FHN  , Universal Forest Products, Inc. UFPI  and Popular, Inc. BPOP  .   5 Stocks with Amazingly Low EV/EBITDA Ratios to Own     Now   Price-to-earnings (P/E), given its apparent simplicity, is the most commonly used metric in the value investing world. The ratio enjoys greater popularity among valuation metrics in the investment toolkit and is preferred while uncovering stocks trading at attractive prices. But even this straightforward, easy-to-calculate equity valuation multiple is not devoid of limitations.  What Makes EV/EBITDA a Better Choice?  While P/E is by far the most-popular valuation metric, a more-complicated metric called EV/EBITDA does a better job in working out the fair market value of a firm. Often viewed as a better substitute to P/E, this ratio offers a clearer picture of a company's valuation and its earnings potential. Also dubbed as the enterprise multiple, EV/EBITDA is essentially the enterprise value (EV) of a stock divided by its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). EV is the sum of a company's market capitalization, its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents. Essentially, it is the total value of a company. EBITDA, the other component of the ratio, gives the true picture of a company's profitability as it eliminates the impact of non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that depress ne t earnings  . It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows. Just like P/E, the lower the EV/EBITDA ratio, the more appealing it is. A low EV/EBITDA ratio could be a sign that a stock is potentially undervalued. However, unlike P/E ratio, EV/EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company's balance sheet. For this reason, EV/EBITDA is usually used to value possible acquisition targets. Stocks with a low EV/EBITDA multiple could be seen as potential takeover candidates. P/E also can't be used to value a loss-making firm. A company's earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. On the other hand, EV/EBITDA is difficult to manipulate and can also be used to value companies that are making loss but are EBITDA-positive. EV/EBITDA is also a useful yardstick in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation. Moreover, it can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt. However, EV/EBITDA has its limitations too. It varies across industries and is generally not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital spending requirements. As such, a strategy entirely based on EV/EBITDA might not fetch the desired outcome. But you can club it with other major ratios such as price-to-book (P/B), P/E and price-to-sales (P/S) to screen true value stocks.
