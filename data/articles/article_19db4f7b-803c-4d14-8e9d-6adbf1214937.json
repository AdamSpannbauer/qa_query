  "text": [
    " Investors in Lannett Company, Inc. LCI  need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Sep 20, 2019 $7.50 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.  What is Implied Volatility?  Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an  options trading  strategy.  What do the Analysts Think?  Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Lannett shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Lannett is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) in the Medical - Drugs industry that ranks in the Top 30% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimate for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 11 cents per share to 19 cents in that period. Given the way analysts feel about Lannett right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there's a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay.
