    "Investors in Deutsche Bank AG (Symbol: DB) saw new options begin trading today, for the October 11th expiration. At Stock Options Channel , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the DB options chain for the new October 11th contracts and identified the following put contract of particular interest.",
    "Because the $7.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 62%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.00% return on the cash commitment, or 28.82% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost .",
