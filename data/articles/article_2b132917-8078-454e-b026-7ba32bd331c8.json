    " With what trepidation did investors turn the page to September? Were they apprehending another sell-off with the global economy in the doldrums or did they believe that the market correction will find its rightful end? To add to the blues, historical data reveals that the August-October period happens to be the most volatile of the year.  makeArticleAd();  As expected, the U.S. stock market stumbled into September with a loss on Tuesday as the sudden deceleration in the U.S. manufacturing activity has left investors edgy. U.S. manufacturing activity declined in August, the first time in three years. Apart from this unapprehended decline, U.S. construction spending for July edged up nominally in the month after a sharp drop in August. Notably, U.S. manufacturing and construction have been the pillars of economic growth over the past couple of years. However, market pundits have been anticipating a slowdown of late.    These headwinds are reflected in the sharp sell-off in the three important market indices on Sep 3. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.1%, shedding 285.3 points. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 lost 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite shed 1.1% in yesterday's session. Notably, Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq lost 1.7%, 1.8% and 2.6%, respectively, in August.

U.S. construction spending grew a slight 0.1% in July at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of $1.29 trillion, aided by government spending on schools, sewers and water supply. July's spending was 2.7% below the year-earlier level.    During the first seven months of 2019, construction spending dropped 2.1% due to a sharp pullback in spending on homebuilding. Spending on private construction has declined 4.4% so far this year, with residential falling 8.5% but non-residential rising 0.6%. Meanwhile, public spending increased a decent 5.6% during the period, led by notable gains in commercial, highway and street conservation and development, and transportation.    Indeed, the construction market, the fate of which is tied to broader economic growth, is expected to suffer due to a weak housing market and a slowdown in global economy. Meanwhile, the baffling trade scenario with China has been upsetting businesses. Also, the first revision of Q2 U.S. GDP slipped from 2.1% to 2%, signaling at more uncertainties ahead.    Nonetheless, builders are increasingly optimistic considering the industry's improving outlook, buoyed by lower interest/mortgage rates along with steady job and wage growth.
