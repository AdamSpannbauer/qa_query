    " What happened Shares of   Hanesbrands    (NYSE: HBI) fell 15.1% last month, according to data provided by   S&P Global Market Intelligence    . Sometimes, stocks make sudden moves based on a surprisingly   good or bad earnings report, and other times, stocks move for   reasons that don't make a lot of sense. The drop in Hanesbrands   stock last month can be chalked up to the latter. The company reported a solid second quarter at the beginning   of August, with the innerwear segment performing in line with   management's expectations.\u00a0But the star of the show   continues to be the growth in the activewear segment, where the   Champion brand is on fire.\u00a0If that wasn't enough to   encourage investors, management also reaffirmed its previous   guidance, calling for growth on the top and bottom line for the   full year.   IMAGE SOURCE: HANESBRANDS.makeArticleAd();  So what To put the Hanesbrands stock performance in context, the   SPDR S&P Retail    ETF, which tracks all the retail stocks in the   S&P 500    index, was down 6.62% in August. That significantly   underperformed the S&P 500 loss of just 1.81%. Retailers have come under pressure lately because of the Trump   administration's latest round of tariff hikes, which took effect   on Sept. 1.\u00a0Some investors worry that these tariffs could   negatively impact a range of consumer goods companies that do   business in China, like Hanesbrands. Still, even with the near-term headwinds of trade wars and   retail store closures,\u00a0Hanesbrands expects revenue to be up   through the end of the year. For 2019, management is calling for   revenue growth of 2% at the midpoint of guidance. Earnings per   share should be up 5%, and operating cash flow is expected to   increase by 17% year over year. Now what The guidance for growth on the top and bottom lines makes the   stock look like a bargain at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of   just 7.4 times next year's earnings estimate.\u00a0The stock also   pays a dividend yield of 4.39%, which looks sustainable based on   the company's trailing-12-month free cash flow of $546   million. Hanesbrands is continuing to nurse a stagnant market for   innerwear, while investing in the fast-growing Champion brand. In   the second quarter, the popular athleisure brand experienced   sales growth, excluding sales to other large retailers, of more   than 50% year over year.\u00a0Champion sales are currently about   a quarter of total revenue at $1.8 billion,\u00a0but management   is looking to grow the brand to $3 billion in annual sales. Investors interested in   finding a value stock in the apparel industry    should keep their eyes on Hanesbrands, given the tremendous   growth opportunity with the Champion brand    and an ultra-cheap valuation.   10 stocks we like better than Hanesbrands       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.
