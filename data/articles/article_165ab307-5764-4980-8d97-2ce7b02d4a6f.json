  "text": [
    " There's a lot to like about shares of warehouse club   Costco    (NASDAQ: COST) , but a sky-high valuation has one analyst taking   a step back. Analyst Rupesh Parikh at Oppenheimer lowered his rating on   Costco stock from outperform to\u00a0 perform on Wednesday   morning, citing an epic 45% rally in 2019. Parikh sees limited   upside potential given the stock's recent performance, although   he continues to view Costco's long-term prospects favorably.   Image source: Costco.makeArticleAd();  Oppenheimer is less optimistic about Costco's earnings in the   near term than the average analyst covering the stock. The   investment bank expects EPS of $8.40 and $8.95 in fiscal 2020 and   2021, respectively, below the consensus analyst estimates of   $8.55 and $9.21. Costco stock has performed well for good reason. The retailer   is largely   Amazon    -proof, with an intensely loyal member base and bulky products   that aren't well suited to e-commerce. Comparable sales growth   has also been consistently impressive, up 6.9% in August. But Parikh has a point. With the stock nearing $300 per share,   Costco trades for more than 34 times the consensus analyst   estimate for fiscal 2020 earnings. For comparison, shares of   Walmart    go for less than 24 times forward earnings. For a relatively slow-growing retailer, that's a valuation   that's tough to justify. Costco certainly deserves to trade at a   premium over other retailers, but the rally this year might have   taken the stock a little too high. Costco remains well positioned in the   consumer staples    and food retailing universe, according to Parikh. But with   difficult comparisons coming up, aggressive analyst expectations,   and a lofty valuation, the stock's incredible performance might   not hold up much longer.   10 stocks we like better than Costco Wholesale       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.
