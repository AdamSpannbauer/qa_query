  "text": [
    "  Science Applications International Corporation SAIC  is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2020 earnings on Sep 5. The company's earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 19.4%. In the las t report  ed quarter, the company delivered earnings of $1.36 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.21 and also improving 11% year over year. Moreover, revenues surged 37% from the year-ago quarter to $1.62 billion and further outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.61 billion, driven by the acquisition of Engility. For the fiscal second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.64 billion, indicating a 47.1% improvement from the year-ago reported figure. For earnings, the consensus estimate stands at $1.27, suggesting a rise of 12.4% from the prior-year reported number. Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.  Factors to Consider  Science Applications' second-quarter fiscal 2020 results are likely to benefit from its strong product portfolio, which is aiding contract wins. The company's capability to sustain its existing contracts coupled with the newly-awarded ones across the customer portfolio is likely to be a steady tailwind. Moreover, the integration of Engility buyout is expected to be a key driver this earnings season. In the last reported quarter, excluding Engility, revenues dipped 2.8% year over year. The acquisition of Engility is also likely to boost the company's margin profile and cash flow generation. However, revenue dis-synergies due to the elimination of prime sub-duplicate revenues persist as a headwind. Further, higher interest expenses are an overhang on the bottom line.   Science Applications International Corporation Price     and EPS Surprise      Science Applications International Corporation   price-eps-surprise    |   Science Applications International Corporation   Quote    What Our Model Says  The proven Zacks model clearly shows that a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has maximum chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP  . Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell) stocks are best avoided. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter  .
