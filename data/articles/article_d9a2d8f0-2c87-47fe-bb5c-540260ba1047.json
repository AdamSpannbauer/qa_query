    "LONDON, Sept 5 (Reuters) - British finance minister Sajid Javid said on Thursday that legislation to delay Brexit which is now set to clear parliament was a \"surrender bill\" and meant the country would have to hold a national election.",
    "\"When it gets Royal Assent it will be a surrender bill and that is why the prime minister has said that, especially once this bill is in place, that we need to move forward as a country, we need to deliver on Brexit, and that's why unfortunately I think we are in the position where we need a general election,\" Javid said in a television interview.",
    "Javid also said the proposed Oct. 15 date for an election announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson would probably be changed because a bill to hold an early election was blocked by parliament on Wednesday."
