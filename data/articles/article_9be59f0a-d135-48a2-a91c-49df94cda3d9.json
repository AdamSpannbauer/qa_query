    "Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dim Prospects",
    "The Zacks Steel Producers industry is part of the broader Zacks Basic Materials sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #172, which places it at the bottom 33% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\r\n The group's Zacks Industry Rank , which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates a gloomy near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\r\n The industry's position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are pessimistic about this group's earnings growth potential. Over the past year, the industry's earnings estimate for the current year has gone down 61.1%.\r\n Before we present a few steel producers stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock market performance and current valuation.Industry Lags S&P 500 & Sector\r\n The Zacks Steel Producers industry has lagged both the Zacks S&P 500 composite and the broader Zacks Basic Materials Sector over the past year.\r\n The industry has declined 36.5% over this period compared with the S&P 500's decline of 0.5% and broader sector's decline of 16.2%.One-Year Price Performance",
    "Industry's Current Valuation\r\n On the basis of trailing 12-month enterprise value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) ratio, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing steel stocks, the industry is currently trading at 5.65X, below the S&P 500's 10.89X and the sector's 8.68X.\r\n Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 9.56X, as low as 5.15X and at the median of 7.60X, as the chart below shows.Enterprise Value/EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) Ratio",

    "Bottom Line\r\n The steel producers industry remains hamstrung by sustained overcapacity, driven by continued growth in Chinese production. Sino-U.S. trade tensions also pose as headwinds to the industry. A weakening Chinese economy amid trade war has triggered a slowdown in steel demand in China. Falling U.S. steel prices are also hurting American steel producers.\r\n Here, we present one stock sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and two stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) that are well positioned to gain amid the prevailing challenges. There is also another stock with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) that investors may currently hold on to. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .L.B.
