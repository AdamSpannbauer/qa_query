    "NEW YORK, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve's balance sheet could end up between $3.8 trillion and $4.7 trillion by 2025, according to projections collected by the New York Fed.",
    "The regional arm of the central bank, which manages the Fed's massive bond holdings, released the projections in a report on Tuesday drawn from surveys of Wall Street traders.",
    "After the crisis, the Fed bulked up its holdings by buying Treasuries using bank reserves it created. Eventually, it started letting bonds and reserves decline to bring policy back to normal.",
    "In July, Fed officials decided to end that bond roll-off by August. They made the decision at the same time as they cut rates for the first time in more than a decade, citing inflation that has fallen below their target, the U.S.-China trade war and other economic concerns. ",
    "To keep control of rates, officials will eventually have to start buying bonds again and building up bank reserves.",
    "The latest estimates are based on multiple scenarios of how quickly parts of the Fed's liabilities will grow, especially the reserves it holds for banks, currently around $1.5 trillion.",
    "Major investors and traders polled by the New York Fed saw those reserves falling to between $1.1 trillion and $1.25 trillion before rising to between $1.2 trillion and $1.5 trillion in 2025, according to the report. "
