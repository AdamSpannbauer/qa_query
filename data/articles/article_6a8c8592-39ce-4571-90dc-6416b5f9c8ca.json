    " The ISM Manufacturing PMI in the United States dropped to 49.1 in August 2019 from 51.2 in the previous month, falling shy of market expectations of 51.1. The latest reading marks the first month of contraction in the manufacturing sector in more than three years  . A 35-month long stretch of expansion came to a halt in August. In fact, the momentum of expansion slowed in the last four months  . The new order index slumped 3.6 points from a month earlier to 47.2, and the employment index fell 4.3 points to 47.4. In addition, the production index slipped 1.3 points to 49.5, and the supplier deliveries index dropped 1.9 points to 51.4, per trading economics  . The U.S.-China trade war has been responsible  for such a debacle as there was steep contraction in new export orders. Supply chain adjustments as a result of moving manufacturing base from China have probably been a drag  on manufacturing data. Overall sentiment touched its lowest level in 2019, per tradingeconomics. Investors should note that the China government enacted higher tariffs on Sep 1 on the proportion of goods that only make up \"about\u00a0 one third of the more than 5,000 product lines  listed in the latest announcement.\" Majority of the duties will be implemented on Dec 15. Meanwhile, Trump said that he would \"raise tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese exports to\u00a0 30% from 25% in October  .\"\u00a0Moreover, tariffs planned on a further $300 billion in Chinese goods have been revised to 15% from 10%. Still, out of the 18 manufacturing industries, nine reported growth in August. Below we highlight a few such sector ETFs.  Vanguard Industrials Index Fund ETF Shares ( VIS )  The machinery industry has also seen growth.
