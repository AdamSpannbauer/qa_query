    "  For Immediate Release  Chicago, IL -September 3, 2019 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Xperi Corporation XPER  , OneMain Holdings, Inc. OMF  , Waddell & Reed Financial, Inc. WDR  , Target Corporation TGT  and Consolidated Communications Holdings, Inc. CNSL  .  Here are highlights from Friday's Analyst Blog:    5 Value Picks That Will Go a Long Way   Value investing is about picking stocks that are trading below their intrinsic value. It should have been easy enough to do, through a comparison of the price to earnings multiple of the company and its peer group (or the S&P 500), or any other criterion you prefer to use for comparison. But of course it isn't that simple, or everyone would have been doing it. The tricky part is in understanding the fair valuation of the stock you're considering. Because, for all you know, the company doesn't have very bright prospects, or there are some big-time headwinds it's facing that aren't affecting the others in the group. And that's what could be keeping the pressure on prices. So how so we know whether a stock is worth putting money into? Obviously, in the current scenario, where there are significant market uncertainties, regular recession warnings and trade war concerns, as well as elevated share prices, one thing you want to avoid is getting into stocks that are headed down. Or extremely risky ventures like Tesla for example, that could either silence all critics or fall flat on its face. True, value investing is for the long haul, you aren't expecting to get rich overnight. But you just don't want to get caught in something like that. So what you basically need is a tried and tested formula that will fetch you guaranteed returns. And that's exactly what the Zacks Value Score for stocks brings you, especially when combined with buy (#1 or #2) ranked stocks.\u00a0 You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here   . So here are a few I've selected that should generate long-term gains. And just in case you need some funds in the interim, they also pay a nice dividend.
