  "text": [
    " Investors in Syndax Pharmaceuticals, Inc. SNDX  need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Nov 15, 2019 $7.50 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.  What is Implied Volatility?  Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an  options trading  strategy.  What do the Analysts Think?  Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Syndax shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Syndax is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry that ranks in the Top 31% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, four analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has narrowed our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from a loss of 53 cents per share to a loss of 47 cents in that period.
