    "The Singapore office will no longer be licensed to hold accounts and all its client funds will either be transferred to a new broker-dealer or liquidated and returned to clients, a spokeswoman for the company said in an emailed statement, adding  the company had decided to focus resources on where it can most effectively serve clients and do it efficiently.",
    "The statement from the company did not specify if the decision to close the office would lead to job losses and the spokeswoman declined comment.",
    "Charles Schwab opened its Singapore office in November 2017 to provide investors in Singapore and Asia with greater access to the U.S. market.",
    "The office was launched after the integration of, and account migration from, optionsXpress, a derivatives trading platform that Charles Schwab acquired in 2011.",
    "Charles Schwab will now focus on growing its business in Hong Kong, China, Latin America and Europe, including the United Kingdom, in addition to the U.S.-based international service teams, the spokeswoman said.",
