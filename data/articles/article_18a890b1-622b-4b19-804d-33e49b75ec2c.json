    "  For Immediate Release  Chicago, IL -September 4, 2019 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Skechers U.S.A., Inc. SKX  , Rent-A-Center, Inc. RCII  , Crocs, Inc. CROX  , Lincoln Educational Services Corp. LINC  and Funko, Inc. FNKO  .  Here are highlights from Tuesday's Analyst Blog:    5 Great Stocks to Buy on Robust Consumption   In July, U.S. consumer spending increased significantly, indicating that worries about a near-term recession were probably overblown. These are great tidings for the financial markets and in particular for those who have been worried that economic weaknesses could upend the market rally. However, robust and steady consumption will likely dispel such fears sooner rather than later. The report is largely in line with the tone witnessed in the latest second-quarter GDP data, which was fueled by consumer spending alone. This is why it still makes good sense to invest in consumer discretionary stocks, which derive strength from personal spending, widely acknowledged as the engine of the U.S. economy.  July's Consumer Spending Beats Estimates  Consumer expenditure increased 0.6% in July, fueled by households' purchases of a variety of goods and services. The increase exceeded the consensus estimate of 0.5% by a whisker and represents a solid improvement over June's gain of 0.3%. Notably, consumer spending accounts for the bulk of U.S. GDP. After accounting for inflation, consumer spending experienced a 0.4% increase in July. This is a major improvement over the 0.2% increase experienced in June. The improvement in core consumption expenditure indicates that consumption remains solid in the early part of the third quarter. This is an encouraging development after the metric advanced at its fastest pace in four and a half years last quarter. Expenditure on goods increased 0.9% in July, fueled by higher spending on recreational products and sports vehicles. Expenditure on services increased 0.5%.  Strong Consumption Fuels Q2 GDP  The latest estimate for second-quarter GDP also indicated that consumption remains the dominant force when it comes to economic growth. The Department of Commerce raised its estimate for growth in consumer spending from 4.3% to 4.7% for the second quarter. The metric benefited from higher spending overall, especially on autos, apparel and restaurants. Strong consumer spending also helped American businesses rack up their first increase in profits in three quarters. The 5.3% rise in adjusted pretax corporate profits was also the first since mid-2014. Higher spending also contributed to a decline in inventory accumulation during the second quarter. (Read: Strong Consumer Spending Fuels Q2 GDP: 6 Top Picks  )  Our Choices  The latest data on the U.S. economy has successfully dispelled fears about a near-term economic slowdown. With American consumers remaining confident, the trend is likely to be sustained in the quarters ahead. This is why investing in consumer discretionary stocks remains a prudent choice. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult. This is where our VGM Score  comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.
