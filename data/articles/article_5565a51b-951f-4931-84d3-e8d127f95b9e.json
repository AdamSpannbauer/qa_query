    "FRANKFURT, Sept 11 (Reuters) - German automotive supplier Continental  and France's Michelin  plan to set up a tyre-making joint venture, according to a list of mergers under review published by the German antitrust authority.",
    "The venture, in which French farming software firm SMAG is also listed as a partner, would be based in Singapore, according to the Aug. 29 filing published on the Federal Cartel Office's website.",
    "Continental declined to comment. The disclosure comes as the company, based in Hanover, restructures in the face of what CEO Elmar Degenhardt this week called a global industry crisis that could only be overcome with state aid. ",
    "The restructuring involves splitting Continental into three divisions. It has said it could spin-off its Powertrain unit rather than listing it. The other units will be Continental Rubber and Continental Automotive."
