    "  Avnet AVT  recently tied up with software company Trusted Objects to provide comprehensive industrial IoT (IIoT) solution for customers with low-power IoT devices.  makeArticleAd();  Per the terms of the partnership, Avnet will embed Trusted Object's native proprietary implementation that can be embedded into a customer's microcontroller unit (MCU) or Secure Element for high levels of security. Moreover, Trusted Object's security stacks will enable easy, secure connectivity between the MCU, the IoT network and the cloud. Lastly, the advanced features of Trusted Objects' technology will allow Avnet to efficiently personalize IoT devices and scale engineering solutions.    The alliance aims to address the fragmentation challenge faced by developers while securing their IoT deployments in cloud, middleware and on-device, especially in low-power devices, which are commonly used in IIoT applications.\u00a0 The alliance will ensure faster time to market and cost reduction. Higher costs and complexity arise when security at each level is managed by separate vendors.    Trusted Objects' native security implementation is particularly designed for IIoT applications, providing a comprehensive platform to manage and implement security throughout the deployment.    Avnet will connect the software from Trusted Objects to the cloud as part of a complete IoT solution as soon as it is embedded in a customer's MCU.   Avnet, Inc. Price and Consensus        Avnet, Inc. price-consensus-chart    |   Avnet, Inc. Quote    Growing Efforts in IoT Solutions Bode Well    Over the past couple of years, Avnet has been trying to expand its presence in the IoT space.
