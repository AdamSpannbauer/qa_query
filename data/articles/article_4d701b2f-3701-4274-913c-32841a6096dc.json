    "  For Immediate Release  Chicago, IL -September 11, 2019 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Microsoft Corp. MSFT  , Merck & Co. Inc. MRK  , The Procter & Gamble Co. PG  , United Technologies Corp. UTX  and The Coca-Cola Co. KO  .  Here are highlights from Monday's Analyst Blog:    Top Dow Stocks to Buy for the Next Rally   Wall Street rally, which started in the last week of August, maintains it momentum. Despite a sluggish U.S. economy, global economic downturn and geopolitical concerns, the stock market remained upbeat owing to renewed trade negotiations between the United States and China and rate cut hope from major central banks, especially the Fed. In line with the broader market, the Dow 30 Index ---- popularly known as the blue-chip index of Wall Street ---- gained in previous four successive trading sessions, posting its longest winning streak since the week ended Jul 15.  Dow Remains Firm Despite Fluctuations  In spite of facing extreme volatility, the Dow 30 has returned more than 15% so far in 2019. In the last week of August and the first week of September, the blue-chip index gained 3% and 1.5%, respectively. On Sep 9, the index closed in the green for four consecutive days with an average gain of nearly 0.7%. Moreover, 18 components of the 30-stock index have provided double-digit returns so far this year.  Two Major Drivers of Dow in September  The Dow is expected to maintain its current momentum for the rest of this month and further due to two immediate catalysts. First, despite an expanding U.S. economy, the market has assigned a high chance for the Fed to reduce the benchmark leading rate again in September after doing the same in July, for the first time in 11 years. Weak job growth, tepid manufacturing data, lower business spending and muted inflation are near-term concerns for the Fed. On Sep 6, Fed Chair Jerome Powell once again reiterated his pledge that the central bank will do whatever is needed to sustain U.S. economic expansion. As of Sep 9, per the CME FedWatch, there is 93.5% probability of a 25-basis point cut in the benchmark lending rate by the central bank at its next FOMC meeting on Sep 17-18 and 6.5% chance of maintaining status quo. Second, on Sep 5, China's Ministry of Commerce informed that Liu He, its top negotiator on trade, had a telephonic discussion with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to reopen the trade-related negotiation. The two sides have agreed to hold the next round of meeting at Washington, D.C. early next month for which preparatory consultations will start from mid-September. Moreover, Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the Global Times and an insider of the Chinese authority tweeted that \"There's more possibility of a breakthrough between the two sides,\" this time. Although market participants are not hopeful of a permanent trade deal between the two largest trading nations of the world anytime soon, a relative calm atmosphere and no further escalation of tariff war will bode well for Wall Street.  Our Top Picks  At this stage, it will be prudent to invest in Dow stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank and strong dividend yield, which will act as a regular income stream to investors. Therefore, these stocks will likely benefit from both market rally and attractive dividend. We have narrowed down our search to five such stocks, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).
