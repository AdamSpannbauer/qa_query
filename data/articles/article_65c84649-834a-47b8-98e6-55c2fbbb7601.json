    "(Washington)",
    "Anyone who has been following the DOL/SEC-fiduciary     rule/best interest saga is probably sick of the word     \"harmonization\". The term is a catch-all for the idea that the     two agencies will synchronize their rule-making so there won't     be any grey area or uncertainty for advisors. We doubt that     will happen (or even can, given the law of unintended     consequences). Yet, a top industry law firm has just weighed on     the specific points where harmonization may happen. The first     big area to consider is rollovers, as both agencies have in the     past claimed it as their own territory. That will likely be an     area where harmonization is necessary because of previous     guidance issued by both. Electronic disclosures will be another     priority area. Additionally, the rules governing defined     benefit versus defined contribution plans will also need to be     harmonized.",
    " FINSUM      :     We are slightly doubtful their will be some great     harmonization between the DOL and the SEC. So, expect some     uncertainty, grey areas, and more business for lawyers. ",
