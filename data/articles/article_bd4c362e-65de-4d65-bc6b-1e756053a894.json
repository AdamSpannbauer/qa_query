Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recen t earnings report  in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.  Univar's Earnings & Revenues Lag Estimates in Q2  makeArticleAd();  Univar logged a profit (on a reported basis) of $16.3 million or 10 cents per share in second-quarter 2019, down around 71% from a profit of $56.1 million or 40 cents a year ago.

On a constant currency basis, revenues rose around 11% year over year. Gains in the company's U.S. business was masked by a soft Canadian agriculture sector and weaker demand for chemicals and ingredients from global industrial end markets.   Segment Review    Revenues at the USA division shot up around 21% year over year on a reported basis to $1,628.7 million in the quarter, driven by the Nexeo acquisition and better sales force execution. Gross profit rose around 29% year over year, helped by favorable product and end-market mix.    Revenues at the Canada segment dropped roughly 10% year over year to $406.5 million. Gross profit was flat year over year in the quarter. The segment witnessed strong performance in the industrial chemical business and certain commodity products.

Gross profit was down around 7% year over year.    Sales from the LATAM unit rose roughly 17% to $116.6 million. Gross profit rose around 8% year over year. The segment gained from the Nexeo acquisition, strong performance in Mexico energy markets and the Brazilian agriculture sector and cost control actions, partly offset by weak industrial demand.
