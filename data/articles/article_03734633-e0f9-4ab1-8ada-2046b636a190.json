    "So one thing is very obvious about Trump's tweets-they can     move markets. However, what is less well-known is that their     frequency also has an effect on indexes. So how do markets fare     on days when Trump is hammering out tweet after tweet versus     days when he only pens a few? The answer is that more is worse.     On days where Trump write 35 tweets or more there is a 9 basis     point drag on markets versus days where he tweets 5 times or     less, where there is a 5 basis point tailwind.",
    " FINSUM      :     There is not much one can do with this info, but it is an     interesting data point. How long before a new \"smart beta\"     product comes out focused on this? Haha. ",
