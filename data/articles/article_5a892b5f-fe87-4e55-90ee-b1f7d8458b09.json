    "(Washington)",
    "It honestly seems like it would have happened sooner given     all the uproar over how \"lenient\" the new SEC best interest     rule supposedly is. Nonetheless, now it has: the SEC has just     had a suit filed against it by no less than seven states and     the District of Columbia as part of an effort to block the     rule. It is the first lawsuit filed against the new regulation     and came from a group that included, California, Delaware, New     Mexico, Oregon, Connecticut, Maine, and New York. The     plaintiffs argue that the rule \"undermines critical consumer     protections for retail investors\". One top lawyer in the space     said \"The day the release came out [about Reg BI], we figured     the SEC would get sued, and here we are\".",
    " FINSUM      :     Not much of a surprise here really, except maybe that the     suit is coming from a pretty formidable group (and not just     some random trade body). Get ready for a long period of legal     limbo. ",
