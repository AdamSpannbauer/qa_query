    "(New York)",
    "There is a new digital custodian in the industry who is     promising 90% cost savings to RIAs on their technology and     custodial costs. That new company is called Altruist, and is a     commission-free custody service that intends to compete with     the big players in the space at their own game. \"Our goal is     for everyone to really pay almost nothing\", says founder Jason     Wenk, continuing \"How much has really changed over the last 10     years? The change is way overdue. It's not like this is some     epiphany for us\". The new Altruist platform will launch in     October and be very easy to integrate with the existing     platforms from major competitors.",
    " FINSUM      :     Technology costs are eating up a huge chunk of revenue     across the industry, so anyone that can lower them and still     provide stellar service will have a competitive edge. ",
