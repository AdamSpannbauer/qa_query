    "\"Consumers continue to act on these lower rates, but the volatility in the market is likely leading some borrowers to pause refinancing and buying decisions,\" Joel Kan, MBA's associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting, said in a statement.",
    "The trade conflict between China and United States has shaken investor confidence, sparking a rush for U.S. Treasuries and other low-risk assets. This move pushed U.S. 30-year yields  to record lows a week ago. ",
