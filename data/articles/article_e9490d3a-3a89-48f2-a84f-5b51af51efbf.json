  "text": [
    " What happened Shares of   Infinera    (NASDAQ: INFN) climbed 38.1% in August, according to data from   S&P Global Market Intelligence    , after the telecommunications equipment maker announced strong   second-quarter results. Infinera stock popped nearly 15% on Aug. 8 alone, the first   trading day after the company revealed its adjusted quarterly   revenue had jumped 47% year over year to $306.9 million -- albeit   largely   driven by its acquisition    of Coriant last year -- which translated to an adjusted net loss   of $42 million, or $0.24 per share. Still, both the top and   bottom lines compared favorably to Infinera's guidance, which   called for a wider per-share loss of $0.30 to $0.26 on revenue   ranging from $290 million to $310 million.   IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.makeArticleAd();  So what Infinera CEO Tom Fallon lauded their \"strong customer   traction,\" including bookings from new Tier-1 customer wins and   the ramp up of a new internet content provider. Fallon elaborated on Coriant, stating \"Continued progress on   our integration program, which we expect to largely complete in   the fourth quarter of 2019, is enabling synergies to track ahead   of our prior commitments.\" For perspective, when Infinera initially announced the deal   last July, management predicted the combined companies would be   able to generate total cost synergies of $250 million through   2021. Now what Infinera also told investors it's targeting fiscal   third-quarter adjusted revenue of $320 million to $340 million,   which should translate to an adjusted loss per share of $0.19 to   $0.15. In this case, most analysts were modeling a loss near the   narrower end of that range on revenue slightly below the midpoint   of Infinera's guidance. During the   subsequent conference call    , management noted that bookings -- a key metric for predicting   future growth -- \"increased materially\" in the second quarter,   and should remain \"solid\" in the third quarter. It also   reiterated that it expects to return to adjusted profitability   and positive cash flow in the fourth quarter of this year, while   at the same time reaching its target for $1.3 billion in revenue   for the full year. In the end, it's clear the market was more than willing to   forgive Infinera for its bottom-line guidance shortfall, both in   light of its relative outperformance in Q2 and its prospects for   sustained, profitable growth    in the coming quarters. If Infinera is indeed able to make the   most of those prospects, I suspect last month's gains will be   only the beginning for this top tech stock going forward.   10 stocks we like better than Infinera       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.
