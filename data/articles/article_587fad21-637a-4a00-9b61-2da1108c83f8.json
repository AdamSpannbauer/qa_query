    " The technology sector, which is benefiting from rapid digital transformation, has been one of the best performing sectors so far this year. Notably, Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) has returned 26.7% year to date, reflecting the sector's strength. The last few years have witnessed a series of breakthroughs in cloud computing, predictive analysis, AI, self-driving vehicles, digital personal assistants and IoT. Moreover, the accelerated deployment of 5G technology - the next wireless revolution - is likely to create more opportunities. This will significantly raise demand for high-tech handheld gadgets and micro-processors. However, the ongoing U.S.-China trade war and a slowing China economy are potent challenges.
